Car crashes and Fentanol overdoses are a similar magnitude. You are right in that a society should focus on issues that have a high combination of probability and criticality. You mention disease related deaths like heart failure, well what does the US spend a good chunk of it's wealth on? Healthcare. So that issue is already a huge focus of effort. Gun related deaths are an unusual issue in the US, the rate is way higher than any comparable developed nation. Is there something that can be done about that? What are the costs associated? It is an issue of harm on par with car crash deaths, so it is certainly worth addressing. Probably not worth spending 15% of the federal budget on, but worth some investment for sure.",1

     I'm using a throwaway account because I got my girlfriend into reddit.(sorry if you see this but idk what else to do)
     So some background, this past February I M(22), lost my best friend in freak car accident. My girlfriend F(20) and I were on the way to a memorial party in his honor, when suddenly she said she needed to vomit. So I pullover and she precedes to throw up, the whole time I'm comforting her and after she was done I asked if she would like to skip the party and go home instead, she perked up and was adamant she was fine. 
     Fast forward two weeks, she asks me if I remember the night of my friends memorial party and how she got sick and that the reason she was sick is because she was on oxycotin and had been for a few weeks.
     Now I hate opiate abuse and she knew this, she says she is sorry and the reason she told me is because she doesn't want to keep any secrets but she waited so long because she didod want to get mad. Now ill admit I did get mad but not such so that I was yelling at her. Anways, I forgave her and asked her to talk to a professional whether it be a therapist or whatever and she refused. I said fine if you ont talk to someone if I catch you doing this again I will break up with you. 
     Fast forward to today, I wake up and notice there is a strange match box on the cofee I have not ever seen before, just out of curiosity I open it and find a rolled up dollar bill and a credit card with white powder. I'm wondering what it is, and then I see the crumbs of oxycotin on the table that she didn't clean. So I left for work without another word
     Now I don't know how long she has been taking them for or where she is getting them from. All I know is I love her and I don't want to break up with her. but I also can't have a partner who is an addict, I don't know if she is addicted or not. Either way WIBTA if I told her family?

15,2020-04-29 21:36:13+00:00,"Yes, characterization matters.

In Who though, the Characterization is alot more transformative, at least for Timelords, through regeneration.

 This is not ""one"" character created by one writing staff with a defined set of characteristics , in  the same sense you have most other characters in fiction. 

Each Incarnation of an timelord is as much an  individual as they are part of the whole person. Just  because  one incarnation was a certain way and reached certain conclusions doesnt mean the next does come to the same way. 

There are of course some very, very rudementary core  values to each Timelord (otherwhise they wouldnt be recognizable at all) but there is a lot of room to do things. 

You cant make the Doctor a genocidal maniac, because that goes against the core-character of The Doctor. You can however  - and the show does that quite a bit with regeneration - play with it. 

The best example is how  the Seventh Doctor, is at the core, still The Doctor. He stands for being good and fighting injustice. 

The Seventh Doctor also mindfucks his companion to play 6D-Chess against an Eldritch God, carefully  orchestrates the self-destruction of his enemies and is just generally very diabolical. Other Doctors just find themself in situations, he  creates them. 

But his core  character is still the same, its everything else that has shifted. 

Similar is the  Master. The Master has ben a Suave Bond-Villain, a Saturday-Morning-Villain, a super-theatrical villain, a  manic villain and  - with Missy  - a sort-ish anti-heroi-ish villain.  And Dhawan is just the next in line.

19,2020-04-29 18:35:04+00:00,"**Context:** The dualistic religion Roukame believes that the end of the world will be heralded by six Harbingers, who will be humans corrupted by Ezar (the evil god). These Harbingers, represented here by the first letter of the Rouka word, are the Hedonist (*Zarona*), the Whore (*Moreth*), the Belligerent (*Aman*), the Leper (*Namorad* - literally diseased/infected but I thought leper sounded more Biblical), the Anticleric (*Menet* - wasn’t sure what the best English word for this was) and the Apath (*Kaian*). It is believed that the Harbingers have appeared once before to destroy the world, but Musmen (the good god) wiped out most of humanity before everyone’s soul was lost, with a warning that the next time humanity turned their back on him, he would do the same to them. The prophet Lam recounts a vision sent by Musmen foretelling how the Harbingers uproot Roukame society as a warning to not let it happen again. 


From the *Prophecy of the Cataclysm* in the book of Lam:

“Suddenly I saw the angel Erenahm stand before me in raiment of silver and white. He reached out his hand to me and as I grasped him by the wrist I was ascended to the stars. I gazed in wonder, for below me I could see all of humanity with their sins laid bare. There beside Erenahm appeared Malach, holding in his hands a mighty sword orange with flame. The Earth went dark below me and I saw the agents of the Opposer appear one by one. 


First to appear was the Hedonist, speaking before great crowds and intimate gatherings., saying: ‘To you who seeks reclamation in the Kingdom of Musmen I say, do not let your time on Earth be sullied by depriving yourself of its pleasures. For the Earth was made by Ezar the Opposer, the Accursed One, but humanity was created to live upon it by our Lord. It is his wish that his children should rejoice in the life they were given. Take heed! Do not go astray from the worship of our Lord by rejecting the principles of a blessed life. But I say to you, the good Lord created humanity to be strong of body and of spirit so you have nothing to fear from allowing yourself joys and luxuries.’ But I saw the words of the Hedonist to be untruths, for the good Roukamen who heeded them became slaves to their earthly desires. 


The second to appear was the Whore, for the words of the Hedonist had made their roots in the soil of Roukame society. Men who were once faithful abandoned their duties and husbands and fathers to fornicate. Each man who spilled his seed into the Whore forfeited his place in the Kingdom of Musmen and gave himself to the Opposer. They no longer wished to lay with their wives, who in turn no longer bore children to raise in accordance with the teachings of Musmen. The cuckolded wives then sought new husbands and started new families. 


The third to appear was the Belligerent. With the seeds of discord sowed among the soil of Roukame society, the Belligerent roused them to solve their conflicts through violence. Farm workers who had once shared the labor of the harvest now spilled blood in the fields over minor arguments. Citizens disgruntled with their governors were incited to take up arms against them. The Belligerent’s words even found their way to the ears of kings, who sent their armies to raze and pillage neighboring states.

The fourth to appear was the Leper. As war spread, as did pestilence and plague brought about by invading soldiers, fornication, and refugees massing together. Soldiers, kings, and peasants alike were afflicted by malady. 


The fifth to appear was the Anticleric, who profaned Roukame and rejected Musmen altogether. Sorcerers and mages of pagan faiths, once exiled or imprisoned, found home in the lands of the Roukamen and performed unholy magics, promising salvation from the plagues and wars. With all of the torment and woe that humanity had inflicted upon itself, the teachings of the Anticleric poisoned the minds of Roukamen and they began to lose their faith in Musmen. 


The final agent was the Apath, a leader who saw the state of the world as brought upon by the other harbingers, but he himself did not suffer. The Apath saw the pain of humanity, heard their cries for help, and knew that something ought to be done about it, but chose to do nothing as the world consumed itself.”

Malach - angel of wrath",3

Pretty much your whole post. The dynamics of the black civil rights movement changed the face of major cities throughout the US. As a result, there's a clear divide that still exists in those cities and many others. In most major cities of the US, you can literally walk from the rich side of town, to the poor side of town. Not to mention, even in suburbia, drugs like oxycotin are still a massive issue. Even out here in the town I live in with five police departments, I've had to clean blood off my store's bathroom wall because some heroin addict cleared his needle carelessly. 

And if you bothered to read any of the statistics I've provided, you'd see the error in your following statement in that those psychopaths with guns, in the absence of having guns, are still psychopaths looking to arm themselves. They will arm themselves, and disarming their choice victims statistically shows that you make them more vulnerable to said crime. As I showed in another reply to a different user, knife crime is over twice as prevalent in the UK as all of gun injury and death in America. In other words, an armed population enjoys a much lower violent crime rate in regards to weapons than a disarmed population does.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

1-most addictions start with a legal prescription;

3-health care professionals will monitor 4 main vital signs, and treat as necessary, those being blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature. Their significance is based on those being objectively determined signs. In the 1990's, a fifth vital sign was added to this list - pain. Unlike the previous 4 signs, pain is determined *subjectively* - for example, a patient is asked to rate their pain on a 1-10 scale.

Dass der Mensch grundsätzlich nicht abhängig sei, ist eine Illusion. Wir sind alle von vielen Dingen abhängig, ich nehme jetzt mal als einfaches Beispiel Nahrung. Wenn du keine Nahrung hast, musst du dein ganzes Leben der Beschaffung unterordnen ja. D.h. du bist den ganzen Tag auf der Suche, wie du das finanzieren kannst, woher du es bekommst etc.

Wie wir alle wissen, ist das aber nichts was an der Abhängigkeit liegt, sondern die Umstände, die die Abhängigkeit begleiten.

Erstens ist Heroin auf dem Schwarzmarkt recht teuer, zweitens oft nicht einfach zu beschaffen, dritttens haben Nutzer oft kein oder wenig Einkommen.

Es gibt aber in Deutschland 10 Suchtstellen, die reines Diamorphin ausgeben. D.h. du gehst dort hin, bekommst den Stoff und das wars. Das hat dann genau so wenig mit dein Leben unterordnen zu tun, wie die Nahrungssuche für den Ottonormal Bürger was mit Unterordnen zu tun hat.

Überdosierungen entstehen u.a. vor allem wegen Konsumpausen und dadurch Rückgang der Toleranz und wenn das Heroin mal statt den üblichen 15% Heroin 30% enthält. Oder andere Stoffe wie Carfentanyl enthält.

Alles was ich oben angeschrieben habe lässt sich durch eine Suchtstoffvergabe lösen. Beziehungsweise so läuft es z.T. auch ab, nur sind die momentanen Bedingungen die nötig sind damit man zugelassen wird absoluter bullshit, ebenso wie für Methadon, abgesehen davon dass die Methadon substitution auch problematisch ist und gesundheitlich im Endeffekt schlechter ist als reines Heroin.

Kurz: Die Unterordnung und Hauptteil der Gefährdung ist nicht der Abhängigkeit selbst zuzuordnen, sondern vor allem der Drogenpolitik und Kriminalisierung.",1

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

48,2020-04-28 05:21:46+00:00,"&gt; The order and design of the earth/universe point to an intelligent mind.

The habitable zone for our solar system is larger than what you think, you forget that the earth went through a variety of stages and different levels of different gasses for the atmosphere as well as several ice ages and eventually the sun will expand and make the earth uninhabitable.  At best this just means the world is unlikely but we know that.  People win the lottery though.

&gt; The Big Bang points to a God.

You don't understand what scientists say about the Big Bang.  They don't say it is the source of these things and time becomes weird when you get really near the point of the singularity.

&gt; The amount of DNA in the first cell is too complex to be by chance. 

Just because you don't believe it can't be the result of natural processes means nothing.  You have to show it can't happen.

&gt; It’s a miracle to believe that life came from non-life. 

Life is fundamentally made of non-life.  Protons, neutrons, electrons aren't alive.  Life is literally a particular kind of chemical reaction.

&gt; Irreducible Complexity of organisms point to a creator.

I love you brought up Charles Darwin and his comment about the eye.  Have you read the full quote he has about it?  I feel important to share so at least you don't make this mistake in the future.  He literally says how it seems impossible to our imagination but when you actually think about it it all makes sense really.

""To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. When it was first said that the sun stood still and the world turned round, the common sense of mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of Vox populi, vox Dei, as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in science. Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to its possessor, as is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case; and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest organisms, in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed with this special sensibility.""

&gt; Transitional fossils are missing from the evolution record for 99% percent of animals.

Evolution has nothing to do with a god.  In fact the single largest organised theistic group in the world, the Catholic Church, holds evolution as true.  It is only an issue if you take a hard creationist view of reality but that puts you massively in the minority against not just scientists but theists.

&gt; If there is no God, why do we trust our minds?

You like to name drop.  It doesn't help.  We trust our minds to a degree because we have to as a starting axiom.  You have to assume you can trust your mind and reason to begin with as a requirement.  It can't be proven but must be taken as true as to even show it were right or wrong you have to assume it to start.  God doesn't factor into this.  Beyond that being able to rationally assess reality seems a useful survival trait right?  Thats all evolution needs.

&gt; Moral absolutes require a moral lawgiver (aka God).

Can you define morality in a clear way that doesn't use vague wiggle words like right or wrong or good or evil?  Morality is a bad word as it means a lot of different things to different people.  Besides this doesn't change it.  Either then its just gods opinion and he has the biggest stick or its some fundamental separate to god.  Either way god isn't the solution to your moral absolutes.

&gt; If there is not a God, then you have no intrinsic (or innate) value.

Yes, you are right.  Value is entirely subjective.  That should be blindingly obvious to everyone.  There is a painting on my wall I got from my grandmother.  It has special value and meaning to me that it won't have to you.  You might not even like it.  Consider an newborn child and the value to their parent compared with some random stranger.

&gt; If there is not a God, then there is no ultimate meaning/purpose for life.

Like these aren't arguments for god.  These are more things you would prefer to not be the case.  Regardless yes, there is no ultimate meaning or purpose for us.  That is kind of the nice thing in that we decide our own purpose.

&gt; The fact that you have a soul/conscience shows that God exists.

First it isn't a fact.  Second of all even if we did you can't demonstrate those things couldn't happen without a god.  So bad point.

&gt; Free will points to a creator. If there is no God, then we do not have free will.

We probably don't have free will.  Certainly we don't have any kind of libertarian free will.  Again though you seem to mix up that just because a god may not exist doesn't mean all this other magic might.

&gt; Intangible values like love, justice, morality point to a God. If there is no God, then love does not exist. It’s all just chemical reactions going off in your brain. 

If love is certain chemical reactions in the brain then it does exist.  That would be how it exists and what it means.  However you should look into the biological reasons why groups bond and the chemistry we know is behind pair bonding.  Oxycotin is a hormone that builds into that.

&gt; If there is not a God, it means that every single ghost encounter, miracle, angel encounter ever recorded is 100% false.

Yes if there is no god these people are wrong.  If Islam is right most  of the world is right.  If the Jewish people are right even more of the world is wrong.  This is also not an argument.  It is a recognition of a fact.  Also again, magical stuff and got are not necessarily the same thing.

&gt; The historical resurrection of Jesus Christ – points to God being real.

You need to look up the history of Jesus more.  The books are all written decades later, by anonymous authors, without us having any ability to actually investigate the claims.

&gt; What is the origin of life? Is there a purpose to life? Why is human life valuable? Why do I behave ethically? Is there an afterlife? All these questions cannot be answered in a science experiment.

They can and most of them have been.  The only real one still on the table to figure out is the exact way life on earth started.

&gt; Don’t fall for the religion of Scientism (which states unless you can scientifically prove something, it’s not true).

Scientism as you think it isn't a thing.  It is a bogeyman people have made up to try to diminish what science actually does.

Usually just simple things like K BBQ and drinks with KADs in their 30s, we usually get around 10 people. There was one big weekend where some of our interstate KADs visited and we had a big crew of 30! We've been doing Friday night drinks over Zoom with a smaller group, since COVID restrictions. 

Most of our KAD events are self-organised and I guess I'd describe them more as this existing the friendship group catching up, rather than formal events. I've been thinking about how we can connect to some of the other, separate, KAD friendship groups out there (or KADs who aren't in any groups but would like to meet) to have more of a centralised presence.

I heard my mom crying one night because a doctor had told her they thought I was faking so I stopped asking for them. It was hella hard to do and all I wanted was to just pretend I was hurting so I didn't have to remember I was in a hospital anymore.",1
67,2020-04-27 04:51:59+00:00,"I thought I knew how I felt about abortion until I had to deal with the positivity of it first hand.   And what I mean there is that I thought I knew what I would want to do in the event of being presented with an unwanted pregnancy.  I figured it was just a pile of cells, so far away from a living creature that I wouldn't even bat an eye at having that be my recommendation in that scenario (I can tell already you're going to jump on this lol).  

Then my wife and I found ourselves pregnant with a 3rd kid.  We had a family in a good place, liked the dynamic, didn't have another kid in the plans and didn't want another one.  The night we found out we both agreed we would about it.  So, here's the situation I had been thinking for years would be a no-brainer.  

Then I started thinking about what it would feel like to give up another kid, what it would be like to actually go through with the procedure.  I realised I wouldn't have been able to do that in her shoes.  We were still going back and forth, so I just told her at that point that she was the one that was going to have to go through with it if we opted for the abortion so it waa her call and I'd fully support her in whatever she chose.  She ended up deciding to keep him.  He's 2 now and I'm damned glad she made that call.

So that got me to thinking.  Why the change of heart?  I realised that I viewed him as alive at that point (4 weeks...).  So my view on abortion has changed.  Substantially.  To the point where I expect a hell of a lot better reason for it from others. 

I wasn't talking about you not knowing what your feelings are regarding abortion as a political issue.  I mean what you think you would do is just a guess.  If you ever have to go through it, and I hope you don't, you might be surprised.  This has fuck all to do with being a woman...

With regards to the rest of your post, believe it or not, the father likely has a worse experience with labour and childbirth in the long run.  My wife barely remembers it.  Some due to drugs, some likely due to your brain shutting it down.  She doesn't remember the doctors calling in the emergency response doctors for our first child.  She doesn't remember the comments from the doctor as the delivery went downhill.  She doesn't remember hardly any of the second one (Fentanal really is a hell of a drug).  I remember it all.  The complete and utter helplessness.  The God awful fear of going back for the second delivery (she was excited to get the pregnancy over...see not remembering the first one).  It was an awful experience being there, knowing they were expecting him to be in trouble if he got out, but not being able to let her see that (or trying not to).  And yet still, that was one day.  The impact he's had on our life (perfectly healthy and awesome little guy) FAR outstrips the impacts of that day.  The financial strain, the strain on our relationship when he was younger and we were still trying to figure things out,  the complete sacrifice of your own free time.  Much more of an impact.  That's what I mean by childbirth is a minor event compared to the rest of it.

Second, I never said anything about a ""good"" reason to have an abortion.  Just the commonly expressed ones and the ones that went through my head when we were debating our third. 

Lastly, abortions (or unwanted pregnancies anyway, not all result in abortion) occur in married couples very frequently.  With a married couple, everything tends to impact both partners.  If you need a source for that...well...  

You have brought up many many many times that I'm a man and couldn't possibly understand the impacts of an abortion.  You're trying to frame it as a womens' rights issue.   That's a load of crap.  It takes two parents to get someone pregnant, so it impacts two people.  Depending on the situation, it can impact one more than the other.  But it WILL impact both.",1

74,2020-04-26 18:39:09+00:00,"Vorweg: Ich habe viel zu viel geschrieben, wenn du alles überspringen willst ist am Ende ein Tl;dr :)

&gt; Bei dem Heroin zum Beispiel, auch wenn es jetzt nur die reinste form wäre und irgendwie keine körperlichen Schäden verursacht (aber unwahrscheinlich, denn überdosis ist überdosis),

Überdosen werden vor allem dadurch verursacht, dass plötzlich der Reinheitsgehalt statt bei 13% mal bei 50% liegt, oder anderes wie Fentanly reingemischt wird. Beides übrigens eine direkte Folge der Kriminalisierung. Bei Interesse führe ich das gerne auch aus :)!

Praktisch alle weiteren Gesundheitsschädlichen Folgen wie HIV, Hepatitis etc. kommen durch die Kriminalisierung. Im Gegensatz zu Alkohol gibt es sonst keine wirklichen körperlichen Schäden. Gerne gebe ich dazu auf Nachfrage eine Quelle oder schicke auch ein PDF.

&gt;  Bei einer so süchtig manchenden Droge, wie soll man denn überhaupt leben? Wenn man stark drin festsitzt, dann verliert man schnell seinen Job, seine Familie, seine geliebten und Freunde, etc.

Warum sollte man die verlieren? Es gibt funktionale Heroinkonsumenten. Habe schon mit einigen gearbeitet. Der Grund wieso diese normalerweise oft verloren werden ist das erstens viele Leute konsumieren weil sie in einer Krise sind, durch die sie sowieso oft Leute verlieren und: Beschaffungskriminalität. Die Schwarzmarktpreise sind extrem hoch, es wird alles für den nächsten Kick getan. Weiterhin die kriminalisierte Drogensubkultur. Die finden Familienmitglieder auch oft nicht so geil.

Deswegen gibt es ja Substitutionsstellen. Und die funktionieren ganz gut. Die Substitution mit reinem Diamorphin statt Metadon klappt sogar noch besser. Nutzer haben weniger Gesundheitsschäden, Beikonsum etc.. Reines Diamorphin ist übrigens Heroin. Wird in 10 Orten in DE so ausgegeben :)

&gt; Kein Arbeitnehmer würde es nähmlich zulassen, dass jemand unter Drogeneinfluss bei der Arbeit antanzt. Vor allem kann es bei einigen Jobs auch andere Menschen gefährden.

Definitiv! Und das selbe gilt für Alkoholiker, Benzoabhängige etc.. Nur muss ich dir leider sagen: Ich habe im psychiatrischen Rahmen schon gearbeitet und ein Großer Teil der Leute mit Suchtproblematik arbeiten weiter. Das der Arbeitgeber es nicht erlauben würde stimmt, klappt aber nur wenn es auffällt. Das tut es bei sehr vielen Süchten nicht und wenn es auffällt oft weil die Leute z.B. Sachen von der Arbeit klauen um die Sucht zu finanzieren. 
 

&gt; Unwahrheiten darüber verbreiten, dass diese Sache doch keinen Schaden anrichten kann, und sogar hilfreich wäre.

&gt; Was mich an Leuten die Drogen verteidigen nervt, ist dass Sie einfach nicht einsehen wollen, dass Drogen schädlich sind.

Da stelle ich die Frage: Was ist jemals wahrlich ungefährlich? Jeder Sport, beispielsweise bietet eine Grundgefahr. Selbst Wasser trinken kann gefährlich sein.

So eine Aussage ist wie du es schon herausgestellt hast daher immer eigentlich falsch. Drogen sind nicht unschädlich, denn praktisch nichts ist unschädlich.

Wenn Leute sagen etwas sei ungefährlich meinen sie daher in der Regel: Die Gefahr die davon ausgeht ist, vor allem bei der Einhaltung der notwendigen Regeln, relativ gering. Manchmal steht auch ein ""vor allem im Verhältnis zum Nutzen"" dahinter.







&gt; Und auch wenn 50% aller Leute die shrooms und LSD nehmen plötzlich einen positiveren Blick aufs Leben haben, heißt dass nicht, dass die Leute die durch die Droge in extreme Angstzustände versetzt werden, oder daraufhin psychotisch werden nicht existieren.


 Total! Aber: Erstens ist eine kausale Verbindung zur Psychose bis heute nicht ausreichend belegt, nicht mal für Cannabis ist sie das. Quelle ist der Bericht des Bundesgesundheitsministeriums, die CaPRis Studie. Das ist nen 400 Seiten bericht, gerne sage ich dir auch wo sich die Aussage im Bezug auf Cannabis findet.

Bei LSD waren alte Zahlen eine Quote von 9/1000.  Alte Studien dazu sind höchst kritisch zu betrachten und hier geht es auch nur um eine Korrelation aber nehmen wir diese Zahl mal. Erstens, ist sie damit praktisch gleich der Psychosequote in der Bevölkerung. Die liegt nämlich auch bei 1%. Zweitens: Damit wäre man bei 9 Psychosen und über 500-800 Nutzern den es durch den Konsum besser geht, oder die die Erfahrung als eine der wichtigsten in ihrem Leben einordnen (kleinere Studie hatte für die Aussage 14/25 wenn ich mich nicht Irre).

Und da sind wir bei dem von mir angesprochenem Punkt: Was heißt hier ungefährlich? Rechtfertigt eine sehr geringe Quote wie es bei LSD und Pilzen zu sein scheint ein Verbot?

Als Vergleich, müsste man Fußball verbieten weil es eine gewisse Anzahl an Teilnehmenden gibt die z.T. auch dauerhafte Schäden davontragen? Obwohl das ein Teil der Autonomie ist und die meisten Teilnehmenden eher positives vom Sport haben? 

Müssen wir Fast Food wegen seinen gesundheitlichen Negativfolgen verbieten? Auch da gibt es einen Genussaspekt und die Autonomie. Und an schlechter Ernährung sterben noch deutlich mehr Menschen.

Meine persönliche Position: Ich würde nicht behaupten, Bier wäre gefährlich. Und das obwohl jede Menge Bier, egal wie wenig, toxisch ist. Und auch Alkohol kann Psychosen auslösen. Natürlich schädigt Bier. Was ich damit meine wenn ich sage, Bier sei nicht gefährlich ist das oben beschriebene: Der Gefahrenaspekt ist unter der Betrachtung des Trinkens zum Genuss, für die Freizeit als Hobby und als sozial lockerndes Mittel neben dem Aspekt der Autonomie zu vernachlässigen. Bei Hartstoff sehe ich das z.B. etwas anders.

Und dann kommen wir zu LSD und Pilzen. Niemand würde bei Bier und Vodka sagen, sie sein einer der 5 bedeutendsten Momente ihres Lebens gewesen. Bei LSD und Pilzen ist das häufig der Fall.

Niemand sagt der Konsum von Alkohol hat ihm nachträglich eine positivere Aussicht auf das Leben gegeben. Bei LSD und Pilzen ist das eher die Regel als die Ausnahme.

Alkohol ist immer toxisch, kann zu einer tödlichen Überdosis führen  und ist ggf. schädlich für die Organe. LSD und Pilze sind körperlich unbedenklich und eine Überdosis tödlich.

Sowohl Alkohol als auch LSD und Pilze können vermutlich Psychosen auslösen, wenn auch nur ein sehr geringes Risiko besteht.

Wenn ich jetzt also der Meinung bin Bier sei ungefährlich und Hartstoff bei einem vernünftigem Konsummuster ebenso, muss ich unter Betrachtung der überwältigenden Positivaspekte dasselbe für LSD und Pilze gelten lassen.

Wenn du jetzt sagst, dass sei Semantik um dem Punkt auszuweichen dass Drogen gefährlich sind. Kann ich verstehen, dann würde ich es folgendermaßen formulieren.

Ebenso wie niemand Fußball unter dem Aspekt der Gefährdung verbieten würde, weil es zur persönlichen Freiheit gehört sich dieser auszusetzen und es in der Regel eher zu einer Förderung der Gesundheit führt, und dabei den meisten Leuten Spaß macht, scheint es mir genau so problematisch LSD und Pilze zu verbieten.

Und zwar mit genau den selben Gründen.

Das bedeutet nicht dass LSD nicht gefährlich ist, genau so wenig wie es bedeutet das Fußball nicht gefährlich ist



Jetzt hab ich sehr lange über diese beiden Substanzen geschrieben, man merkt, es ist Corona Zeit.

Denn mein eigentlicher Punkt ist einfach nur: Drogen sind massiv unterschiedlich schädigend und bieten auch massiv unterschiedliche Vorteile. 

Wer denkt Heroin nehmen sie unbedenklich hat einen an der Kante und auch Crack rauchen ist massiv gesundheitsschädigend. Trotz allem sind ein nicht zu vernachlässigender Teil der Gesundheits- und Sozialschädigung auf die Illegalisierung, nicht die Substanz selber zurück zu führen. Vor allem bei Heroin.

Bei Gewissen Substanzen ist die Schädigung an der Gesundheit im Vergleich zu den Vorteilen und der Autonomie allerdings so gering, dass ein generelles Verbot aber unsinnig ist. 

Tl;Dr: Gibt es überhaupt irgendwas was nicht gefährlich sein kann? Ich sage nein, gibt es nicht. Wenn jemand sagt etwas sei nicht gefährlich, meint er in diesem Kontext vermutlich ""Nicht substanziell gefährlich genug um die Einschränkungen und Vorteile durch die Substanz zu rechtfertigen"". Wenn jemand das so meint, stimme ich bei einigen Substanzen zu. Wenn jemand ehrlich meint MDMA, Pilze, Heroin whatever seien zu 100% unbedenklich dann stimme ich dir zu. Das ist verharmlosung und realitätsfern.",1

On Kant's definitions of rationality, (i think) he means rational as opposed to beings that are simply reacting to environmental changes, like we wouldn't say that plants have rational agency, but humans do.   

Back to the death cult man, well we can make assertions to people's intentions and assertions, but we can never truly deductively know a person's intentions behind their actions. 

With the updated example, it was an attempt to cut away any other motivations/inclinations/cravings that this man might possess. To cut away the idea of being ""seen"" as right, lets imagine a world where there's only the death cult man, and 3 other people, whom are in a coma, but very much still alive. No such thing as social media, internet, nor any other creatures or sentient beings will see him performing the murderous act. Now, lets say that the man has his entire happy hormones receptors of oxycotin, serotonin and dopamine completely dead, which means that he doesn't get any emotional high or happiness from doing anything. Nonetheless, he still ends up killing the 3 comatose people out of his perceived duty. So now, no one can see him being ""right"", nor does he fulfill any craving to do so. At best, we can say that he's doing it out of a duty, but we can never really know why someone does something. 

I think that there are people who exist who do the right thing because its the right thing to do, and that is ""truly doing the right thing"". Its the people that stand up to bullies when no one else is looking, donating to charity without talking about it on social media and so on. These people do exist. I think everybody in some way, wants to be ""right"". 

Often when people talk normative ethics, they don't immediately make the link back to the empirical/observable world. Normative ethics is a different ball game from other domains of knowledge because its a priori, which is coming up with reasons and explanations that comes from theoretical deduction without reference to observation or experience, whereas other domains of knowledge require evidence, observation, data and so on to make claims. 

Nonetheless, ethics and moral philosophy is actually quite interesting, albeit sometimes quite cheem and half the time ppl don't know what the philosophers are saying/writing about.",1

Really struggle with steps and I've lost use of my left shoulder as of last year. But the best part of that is that I live in constant pain. I have many scars that have all keloided which burn all the time. Most my joints are in constant pain especially my left shoulder. I have macromastia so my back always hurts. I've pretty much lived the past 12 years which is very literally half my life on a daily dose of prescribed Oxycodine. Which helps with the pain a little bit, but not all the way. To keep my legs from atrophying I also play games on an exercise bike all that I can. Even PC, I got a little shelf it's nice, pro set up.

So the best thing I've found to counter the pain is pretty much ignoring it. Playing games, with a second TV to have something playing blah blah blah. The downside of that is also accidentally ignoring the pain of hunger. So I'll notice like shit it's 5pm already?! I need to eat.

118,2020-04-24 14:01:10+00:00," O ministro Sergio Moro (Justiça) decidiu entregar o cargo nesta sexta-feira (24) e deixar o governo de Jair Bolsonaro [após a exoneração do diretor-geral da Polícia Federal, Maurício Valeixo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-exonera-diretor-geral-da-pf-em-meio-a-negociacoes-para-permanencia-de-moro.shtml), ter sido publicada nesta madrugada no Diário Oficial da União. Ele anunciou a saída do governo a pessoas próximas.

 [Conforme a **Folha** revelou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-avisa-moro-que-vai-trocar-diretor-geral-da-policia-federal.shtml), Moro pediu demissão a Bolsonaro na manhã desta quinta (23) quando foi informado pelo presidente da decisão de demitir Valeixo. O ministro avisou o presidente que não ficaria no governo com a saída do diretor-geral, escolhido por Moro para comandar a PF.

 Após Moro anunciar um pronunciamento às 11h desta sexta, o Planalto enviou emissários para tentar convencer o ministro a ficar. Em vão. Moro não aceitou, mostrou-se irredutível. Nas palavras de um aliado, ""os bombeiros fracassaram"".

 O contexto da exoneração de Valeixo foi considerado decisivo para o ministro bater o martelo.

 A exoneração foi publicada como ""a pedido"" de Valeixo no Diário Oficial, com as assinaturas eletrônicas de Bolsonaro e Moro. Segundo a **Folha** apurou, porém, o ministro não assinou a medida formalmente nem foi avisado oficialmente pelo Planalto de sua publicação.

  O nome de Moro foi incluído no ato de exoneração pelo fato de o diretor da PF ser subordinado a ele. É uma formalidade do Planalto.

 Na avaliação de aliados de Moro, Bolsonaro atropelou de vez o ministro ao ter publicado a demissão de Valeixo durante as discussões que ainda ocorriam nos bastidores sobre a troca na PF e sua permanência no cargo de ministro. Diante desse cenário, sua permanência no governo ficou insustentável, e Moro decidiu deixar o governo.

 Membros da Polícia Federal e do Ministério da Justiça, ouvidos pela **Folha **na condição de anonimato, [afirmam](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-tenta-controlar-investigacoes-e-blindar-familia-dizem-integrantes-da-justica-e-da-pf.shtml) que o movimento de Bolsonaro que resultou no pedido de demissão feito por Moro tem como o pano de fundo a tentativa de o presidente controlar as ações e as investigações da corporação no país.

 Para pessoas próximas ao ministro, os alvos são variados, mas o foco está em apurações que [podem resultar em problemas para a família presidencial e para sua rede de apoio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/pivo-de-embate-entre-moro-e-bolsonaro-pf-apura-casos-que-envolvem-entorno-do-presidente.shtml). E na falta de ações contudentes contra adversários políticos. Como as que envolvem a disseminação de fake news por parte da rede de apoio bolsonarista. 

 [Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/moro-e-aprovado-por-59-e-titular-do-turismo-tem-11-diz-datafolha.shtml) topou largar a carreira de juiz federal, que lhe deu [fama de herói pela condução da Lava Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/moro-se-inspirou-em-operacao-da-italia-prendeu-lula-e-ganhou-status-de-heroi-veja-trajetoria.shtml), para virar ministro.

 Tomou posse com o discurso de que teria total autonomia e com [status de superministro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/bolsonaro-anuncia-moro-no-superministerio-da-justica-e-promete-nao-interferir-no-combate-a-corrupcao.shtml). Desde que assumiu, porém, acumulou série de recuos e derrotas.

 [Moro se firmou como o ministro mais popular do governo Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/12/em-um-ano-moro-se-firma-acima-de-bolsonaro-e-como-ministro-mais-popular-diz-datafolha.shtml), com aprovação superior à do próprio presidente, segundo o Datafolha.

 Pesquisa realizada no início de dezembro de 2019 mostrou que 53% da população avalia como ótima/boa a gestão do ex-juiz no Ministério da Justiça. Outros 23% a consideram regular, e 21% ruim/péssima. Bolsonaro tinha números mais modestos, com 30% de ótimo/bom, 32% de regular e 36% de ruim/péssimo.

 O ministro, nos bastidores, vinha se mostrando insatisfeito com a condução do combate à pandemia do coronavírus por parte de Bolsonaro. Moro, por exemplo, atuou a favor de Luiz Henrique Mandetta (ex-titular da Saúde) na crise com o presidente.

 Aliados de Moro avaliam que ele foi um dos alvos da [recente declaração de Bolsonaro de que usaria a caneta contra ""estrelas""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-diz-que-usara-a-caneta-contra-integrantes-do-governo-que-viraram-estrelas.shtml) do governo.

 ""[De] algumas pessoas do meu governo, algo subiu à cabeça deles. Estão se achando demais. Eram pessoas normais, mas, de repente, viraram estrelas, falam pelos cotovelos, tem provocações. A hora D não chegou ainda não. Vai chegar a hora deles, porque a minha caneta funciona"", afirmou Bolsonaro, no início do mês, a um grupo de religiosos que se aglomerou diante do Palácio da Alvorada.

 ​Sob o comando de[ Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/apos-crise-bolsonaro-volta-a-sinalizar-que-pode-indicar-moro-para-vaga-no-stf.shtml?utm_source=folha&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_campaign=topicos), a Polícia Federal viveu clima de instabilidade no ano passado, quando [Bolsonaro anunciou uma troca no comando da superintendência do órgão no Rio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/interferencias-de-bolsonaro-em-orgaos-do-governo-vao-de-filmes-a-exoneracoes-veja-lista.shtml) e ameaçou trocar o diretor-geral.

 No meio da polêmica, o presidente chegou a citar um delegado que assumiria a chefia do Rio, mas foi rebatido pela Polícia Federal, que divulgou outro nome, o de Carlos Henrique de Oliveira, da confiança da atual gestão. Após meses de turbulência, o delegado assumiu o cargo de superintendente, em dezembro.

 No fim de janeiro, o presidente colocou de volta o assunto na mesa, quando [incentivou um movimento que pedia a recriação do Ministério da Segurança Pública](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/recriacao-do-ministerio-da-seguranca-foi-articulada-com-bolsonaro.shtml). Isso poderia impactar diretamente a polícia, que poderia ser desligada da pasta da Justiça e ficaria, portanto, sob responsabilidade de outro ministro.

 [Bolsonaro depois voltou atrás](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/bolsonaro-recua-e-diz-ter-zero-chance-de-esvaziar-agora-ministerio-de-moro.shtml) e disse que a chance de uma mudança nesse sentido era zero, ao menos neste momento.

 Com a demissão, Moro vê mais distante a possibilidade de ser indicado pelo presidente para [uma vaga no STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/entenda-polemica-sobre-anunciada-indicacao-de-moro-para-vaga-no-stf.shtml)). Sobre isso, Moro já respondeu que essa é uma ""perspectiva interessante"" e que [seria como ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/moro-diz-que-virar-ministro-do-stf-seria-como-ganhar-na-loteria.shtml)[ganhar na loteria](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/moro-diz-que-virar-ministro-do-stf-seria-como-ganhar-na-loteria.shtml).

 Pelo critério de aposentadoria compulsória aos 75 anos dos ministros do Supremo, as próximas vagas serão as de Celso de Mello, em novembro, e Marco Aurélio Mello, em julho de 2021. A indicação de ministros do Supremo é uma atribuição do presidente que depois precisa ser aprovada pelo Senado.

 Esse caminho de Moro ao Supremo já estava enfraquecido especialmente depois da divulgação de [mensagens privadas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/entenda-vazamento-de-conversa-entre-moro-e-deltan-e-impacto-para-a-lava-jato.shtml) que trocou com procuradores da Lava Jato.

 As mensagens obtidas pelo Intercept e divulgadas até este momento pelo site e por outros órgãos de imprensa, como a **Folha**, expuseram a proximidade entre Moro e os procuradores da Lava Jato e colocaram em dúvida a imparcialidade como juiz do atual ministro da Justiça no julgamento dos processos da operação.

 Quando as primeiras mensagens vieram à tona, em 9 de junho do ano passado, o Intercept informou que obteve o material de uma fonte anônima, que pediu sigilo. O pacote inclui mensagens privadas e de grupos da força-tarefa da Operação Lava Jato em Curitiba, no aplicativo Telegram, a partir de 2015.

 Em resumo, no contato com os procuradores, Moro indicou testemunha que poderia colaborar para a apuração sobre o ex-presidente Lula, orientou a inclusão de prova contra um réu em denúncia que já havia sido oferecida pelo Ministério Público Federal, sugeriu alterar a ordem de fases da operação Lava Jato e antecipou ao menos uma decisão judicial.

 Caso haja entendimento de que Moro estava comprometido com a Procuradoria (ou seja, era suspeito), as sentenças proferidas por ele poderão ser anuladas. Isso inclui o processo contra Lula no caso do tríplex de Guarujá, que levou o petistas à prisão em 2018, está sendo avaliado pelo STF e pode ser julgado ainda neste ano.

 Para pessoas próximas ao ministro, os alvos são variados, mas o foco está em apurações que [podem resultar em problemas para a família presidencial e para sua rede de apoio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/pivo-de-embate-entre-moro-e-bolsonaro-pf-apura-casos-que-envolvem-entorno-do-presidente.shtml). E na falta de ações contudentes contra adversários políticos.  
   
 Como as que envolvem a disseminação de fake news por parte da rede de apoio bolsonarista. O presidente não tem acesso a informações do inquérito conduzido pelo ministro do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) Alexandre de Moraes e culpa por isso o diretor-geral da PF, Maurício Valeixo, homem de confiança de Moro.

 Conforme revelou a **Folha**, [Moro pediu demissão ao ser informado de que Valeixo seria substituído](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-avisa-moro-que-vai-trocar-diretor-geral-da-policia-federal.shtml). Ato contínuo, o [governo deflagrou uma movimentação para tentar demovê-lo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/assessores-do-planalto-buscam-solucao-de-consenso-na-pf-para-moro-ficar.shtml), o que incluía a possibilidade de ele indicar o novo comandante da PF.

 [Moro fará um pronunciamento às 11h desta sexta-feira](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-exonera-diretor-geral-da-pf-em-meio-a-negociacoes-para-permanencia-de-moro.shtml). A iniciativa ocorre após Bolsonaro ter exonerado Valeixo do cargo, em decisão publicada na madrugada no Diário Oficial da União.

 Nos bastidores da Polícia Federal, a saída de Valeixo é forma de proteger os filhos, principalmente o deputado Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL-SP) e o [vereador Carlos Bolsonaro (Republicanos-RJ)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/com-crise-do-coronavirus-carlos-ganha-gabinete-vizinho-ao-do-presidente-no-planalto.shtml).

  [A CPMI (Comissão Parlamentar Mista de Inquérito) das Fake News](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/alcolumbre-contraria-familia-bolsonaro-e-amplia-prazo-para-cpi-das-fake-news.shtml) identificou, com a ajuda de policial federal cedido ao Congresso, a participação de assessor do parlamentar na disseminação de ataques nas redes contra políticos e judiciário.

 ​Esta semana, o deputado pediu ao STF para que a CPMI não tenha seus trabalhos prorrogados.  
 O presidente tem falado ainda a aliados que quer colocar a PF para apurar supostos desvios relacionados à pandemia do novo coronavírus nos estados.

 Bolsonaro quer investigar supostas irregularidades no Rio e em São Paulo, [leia-se os governadores Wilson Witzel (PSC) e João Doria (PSDB)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-diz-respeitar-decisao-do-stf-e-que-queixa-sobre-quarentena-deve-ser-feita-a-governadores.shtml).

 Outra avaliação dentro do Ministério da Justiça é a de que o presidente tenta achar culpados para as crises que ele mesmo gera e tem transferido para Moro problemas relacionados a família e apoiadores. Além de ver no ministro um adversário político em potencial.

 O presidente da Associação Nacional dos Peritos Criminais Federais (APCF), Marcos Camargo, afirmou que Bolsonaro tem que ter cautela ao se discutir uma troca de comando na pasta.

 “Alertamos, como já fizemos em outras ocasiões, que a prerrogativa de mudar a chefia dos órgãos não dá ao Executivo carta branca para destituir, sem critérios claros, os ocupantes das funções. Isso abre perigoso precedente que passa a ameaçar, inclusive, futuros ocupantes dos cargos. Respeitar a PF como instituição é fundamental para assegurar a efetividade do combate ao crime, doa a quem doer.”

 Entre os parlamentares, eclodiram ao menos três teses sobre a[ tensão envolvendo o ministro da Justiça e Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/desgastado-moro-da-sinais-de-cansaco-no-cargo-e-de-contrariedade-a-bolsonaro-na-pandemia.shtml).

 Alguns disseram suspeitar de que o afastamento de Valeixo e consequente enfraquecimento de Moro tenha entrado no acerto que o [presidente tem costurado com partidos do centrão](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/nao-sei-po-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-se-aceitara-indicacoes-politicas-para-cargos-do-governo.shtml). Vários integrantes das siglas são alvos da operação Lava Jato, que teve em Moro seu principal personagem até o final de 2018.

 Eles avaliam que esses parlamentares respaldam a troca por se ressentirem com o comportamento da polícia durante as investigações da operação.

 ​“O governo prometido por Bolsonaro acabou. O plano liberal de [Paulo] Guedes e o plano de combate à corrupção de Moro foram derrotados pela pandemia, rachadinhas e pelo casamento com o Centrão. Resta a ignorância boçal de Weintraub [Educação] e Ernesto [Relações exteriores]. E alguns generais tentando evitar o desastre”, escreveu o senador Alessandro Vieira (Cidadania-SE), em uma rede social.​

 Outra hipótese que circulou é que a troca do diretor da PF tinha como foco o temor dos rumos da investigação não só das milícias digitais pró-Bolsonaro, mas do [ato pró-golpe militar da qual Bolsonaro participou no domingo (19)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/procurador-pede-ao-tcu-investigacao-sobre-uso-de-verba-publica-em-ato-pro-golpe.shtml).

 No Congresso, os que se manifestaram abertamente, criticaram a possibilidade de troca do comando da PF e saíde de Moro.

 Para o líder do Podemos na Câmara, deputado Léo Moraes (RO), com a saída do ex-juiz, o governo perde tecnicamente “um dos seus melhores e mais respeitados nomes”.

 A demissão também joga “desconfiança sobre o Palácio do Planalto quando diz ter como uma das prioridades o combate à corrupção”, complementa. “A demissão de Moro só será comemorada pelos corruptos”.

 O deputado Marcelo Ramos (PL-AM) avalia que a saída de Moro aumenta “o momento de instabilidade política e institucional”. “É tudo que não precisamos nesses tempos.”

 Para o líder do PP no Senado, Otto Alencar (BA), o ex-juiz não deveria ter esperado tanto tempo para sair do governo. “Ele (Moro) já deveria ter pedido para sair. Ele foi [desautorizado várias vezes pelo presidente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/entenda-recuos-e-derrotas-de-moro-desde-que-ex-juiz-virou-superministro-de-bolsonaro.shtml). Se ele sair, vai ter tomado a decisão que há muito se esperava dele.”

 A senadora Simone Tebet (MDB-MS), presidente da CCJ (Comissão de Constituição e Justiça) do Senado, diz que uma saída do ministro vai abalar o apoio popular a Bolsonaro, mas também será prejudicial a Moro.

 “Eles estão amarrados um ao outro. Se o Moro pede para sair, Bolsonaro perde sua estabilidade e apoio popular, que está muito calçado na atuação do ministro. Se o Moro sair, ele perde a chance de conseguir uma indicação ao STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal)”.

 [Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/moro-e-aprovado-por-59-e-titular-do-turismo-tem-11-diz-datafolha.shtml) topou largar a carreira de juiz federal, que lhe deu [fama de herói pela condução da Lava Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/moro-se-inspirou-em-operacao-da-italia-prendeu-lula-e-ganhou-status-de-heroi-veja-trajetoria.shtml), para virar ministro.

 Na avaliação de aliados de Moro, Bolsonaro atropelou de vez o ministro ao ter publicado a demissão de Valeixo durante as discussões que ainda ocorrem nos bastidores sobre a troca na PF e sua permanência no governo. Diante desse cenário, crescem as expectativas sobre a saída do ministro ainda nesta sexta.

 Uma [solução](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/assessores-do-planalto-buscam-solucao-de-consenso-na-pf-para-moro-ficar.shtml) para sua permanência vem sendo discutida pelos ministros generais da Casa Civil, Walter Braga Netto, e da Secretaria de Governo, Luiz Eduardo Ramos. Segundo assessores presidenciais, uma indicação positiva havia sido dado pelo ministro da Justiça.

 Moro havia sinalizado até a noite passada, portanto antes da demissão de Valeixo ser oficializada, que estava disposto a aceitar um acordo desde que tivesse a palavra final na sucessão na Polícia Federal. ​A dúvida agora é se, com a saída de Valeixo durante as negociações, o ministro topará continuar no governo.

 Um nome que conta com a simpatia do ex-juiz da Lava Jato para dirigir a PF, segundo aliados do ministro, é o do diretor do Depen (departamento penitenciário nacional),​ Fabiano Bordignon​.

 Já Bolsonaro defende a nomeação para o posto do diretor-geral da Abin (Agência Brasileira de Inteligência), Alexandre Ramagem, ou do secretário de Segurança Pública do Distrito Federal, Anderson Torres.​

 Bolsonaro informou o ministro, em reunião, que a mudança na PF deve ocorrer nos próximos dias. Moro então pediu demissão do cargo, e Bolsonaro tenta agora reverter a decisão do ex-juiz federal.

 Os ministros Braga Netto (Casa Civil) e Luiz Eduardo Ramos (Secretaria de Governo) foram escalados para convencer o ministro a recuar da decisão. Se Valeixo sair, Moro sairá junto, segundo aliados do ministro.

 Valeixo foi escolhido por Moro para o cargo. O atual diretor-geral é homem de confiança do ex-juiz da Lava Jato. Desde o ano passado, Bolsonaro tem ameaçado trocar o comando da PF. O presidente quer ter controle sobre a atuação da polícia.

 O ministro também tem se mostrado, nos bastidores, insatisfeito com a condução do combate à pandemia do coronavírus por parte de Bolsonaro. Moro, por exemplo, atuou a favor de Luiz Henrique Mandetta (ex-titular da Saúde) na crise com o presidente.

 Com esse novo embate, Moro vê cada vez mais distante a [promessa de uma vaga no STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/entenda-polemica-sobre-anunciada-indicacao-de-moro-para-vaga-no-stf.shtml)).

 As mensagens obtidas pelo Intercept e divulgadas até este momento pelo site e por outros órgãos de imprensa, como a **Folha**, expuseram a proximidade entre Moro e os procuradores da Lava Jato e colocaram em dúvida a imparcialidade como juiz do atual ministro da Justiça no julgamento dos processos da operação.

 Quando as primeiras mensagens vieram à tona, em 9 de junho, o Intercept informou que obteve o material de uma fonte anônima, que pediu sigilo. O pacote inclui mensagens privadas e de grupos da força-tarefa da Operação Lava Jato em Curitiba, no aplicativo Telegram, a partir de 2015.

 Em resumo, no contato com os procuradores, Moro indicou testemunha que poderia colaborar para a apuração sobre o ex-presidente Lula, orientou a inclusão de prova contra um réu em denúncia que já havia sido oferecida pelo Ministério Público Federal, sugeriu alterar a ordem de fases da operação Lava Jato e antecipou ao menos uma decisão judicial.

 ​Sob o comando de[ Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/apos-crise-bolsonaro-volta-a-sinalizar-que-pode-indicar-moro-para-vaga-no-stf.shtml?utm_source=folha&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_campaign=topicos), a Polícia Federal viveu clima de instabilidade no ano passado, quando [Bolsonaro anunciou uma troca no comando da superintendência do órgão no Rio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/interferencias-de-bolsonaro-em-orgaos-do-governo-vao-de-filmes-a-exoneracoes-veja-lista.shtml) e ameaçou trocar o diretor-geral.

 No meio da polêmica, o presidente chegou a citar um delegado que assumiria a chefia do Rio, mas foi rebatido pela Polícia Federal, que divulgou outro nome, o de Carlos Henrique de Oliveira, da confiança da atual gestão. Após meses de turbulência, o delegado assumiu o cargo de superintendente, em dezembro.

 No fim de janeiro, o presidente colocou de volta o assunto na mesa, quando [incentivou um movimento que pedia a recriação do Ministério da Segurança Pública](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/recriacao-do-ministerio-da-seguranca-foi-articulada-com-bolsonaro.shtml). Isso poderia impactar diretamente a polícia, que poderia ser desligada da pasta da Justiça e ficaria, portanto, sob responsabilidade de outro ministro.

 [Bolsonaro depois voltou atrás](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/bolsonaro-recua-e-diz-ter-zero-chance-de-esvaziar-agora-ministerio-de-moro.shtml) e disse que a chance de uma mudança nesse sentido era zero, ao menos neste momento.

 **RECUOS E DERROTAS DO 'SUPERMINISTRO'**

 **Ministério da Segurança Pública -** Bolsonaro [afirmou que pode recriar a pasta da Segurança Pública](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/bolsonaro-diz-que-moro-ficara-na-justica-se-pasta-da-seguranca-for-recriada.shtml), que hoje integra o Ministério da Justiça. Com isso, a área sairia da alçada de Moro. O ministro, contudo, tem usado como principal vitrine da sua gestão a [redução de homicídios](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/07/ao-usar-sinesp-para-fim-politico-moro-aceita-falha-e-infla-papel-do-planalto.shtml), que foi iniciada no governo de Michel Temer (MDB).

 **Prisão após condenação em 2ª instância -** Em novembro, o Supremo Tribunal Federal [voltou a barrar a prisão de condenados logo após a segunda instância](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/entenda-o-que-decidiu-o-stf-sobre-prisao-apos-2a-instancia.shtml). Decisão permitiu a soltura do ex-presidente Lula, condenado pelo ex-juiz. Ponto muito defendido pelo ministro, a execução antecipada da pena foi tirada do pacote anticrime pela comissão que analisou o texto na Câmara. Por outro lado, Moro tem liderado esforço no Congresso para a elaboração de nova lei que permita a medida.

 **Pacote ****anticrime - **O projeto aprovado pelo Congresso e [sancionado por Bolsonaro ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/12/bolsonaro-sanciona-pacote-anticrime-com-vetos-mas-mantem-juiz-de-garantias.shtml)foi um tanto diferente daquele apresentado por Moro à Câmara no início de 2019. Para além da prisão após segunda instância, a ampliação das causas excludentes de ilicitude, que poderia isentar de punição policiais que matassem em serviço, também foi removida. Das 38 sugestões de vetos que constavam em parecer do Ministério da Justiça, quatro foram atendidas por Bolsonaro de forma integral e uma de forma parcial.

Acho incrivelmente humano de sua parte, ter medo por sua vida e ficar ansioso por conta de toda situação. Qualquer um fica, até o mais forte. Então, você tem meu apoio e te desejo melhoras. Saiba que compartilho seus sentimentos. 

Mas...

O homem de ferro não existe na vida real. A realidade é muitas vezes mais cruel do que a ficção. E heroi existe sim. Mas ele não tem poderes, não é alienígena ou super inteligente. Herói de verdade arrisca a própria vida pela dos outros. Essa é a definição de herói no mundo real. Por isso médicos, bombeiros, soldados, policiais, e muitos outros são considerados heróis. Pelo fato da priorização da vida alheia.

A questão real é que você não quer cumprir seu dever. E quando eu digo dever, é literalmente isso, no absoluto da palavra. Dever. 

E o sentido de ""dever"" é diferente de ""obrigação"". Dever é uma condição que o indivíduo aceita a cumprir, incluindo suas consequências, logo não lhe é imposto. Obrigação é uma condição imposta, independente da vontade do indíviduo.

E você aceitou o dever de ser médico. Toda profissão há ônus e bônus. O ônus da sua é justamente esse, o dever. O bônus é um bom salário, status social, e uma qualidade de vida proporcional ao risco.

Por isso, o mais certo a se fazer é abandonar essa profissão que vc tem atualmente. Você sabe medicina, mas não é médico. Você sabe estabilizar uma pessoa, mas não está disposto a sacrificar sua vida por isso. 

O dever do médico está acima de sua vontade. Você estuda filosofia no curso justamente por causa dessas coisas, e novamente, você sabe disso.

Portanto, abandone a idéia de medicina. Pra ser médico, assim como bombeiro, não basta saber da área, entender conceitos e ter a experiência da prática. Precisa também arriscar a vida. Cumprir o dever. 

Então, ainda há uma solução. Você pode se encorajar e assumir sua profissão, quando mais se precisam dela. Ou então, desistir e procurar algo que seja mais certo pra você.

Ao contrário, caso você continue nessa situação, acovardado, estará passando uma imagem negativa  e será, como diz o chefe Eric Jacquin, a vergonha da profissão. Continuar nessa sua situação não dá.

 Entre as novidades está um dos longas mais celebrados no período das premiações e talvez o maior favorito ao Oscar antes da vitória de ""Parasita"": ""1917"", drama de guerra de Sam Mendes que venceu três prêmios da Academia, mas ficou sem a estatueta principal. Já o terror ""Ameaça Profunda"", com Kristen Stewart, não ficou muito tempo em cartaz e ganha nova oportunidade nas plataformas sob demanda.

 E a semana ainda reserva ""Aeroporto Central"", documentário de Karim Aïnouz premiado no Festival de Berlim que vai direto para o streaming. O filme estrearia nos cinemas no dia 26 de março, mas foi adiado devido à pandemia.

And explain the USA's diehard commitment to the CDC/FDA view on Medical Science.  As stated in the video they subscribe to Germ (bacterial, virus) only.  All diseases are caused by a virus or Germ.  And Dr. Shiva gives a few examples, I know a few myself.. But lack of Vitamin C causes scurvy, lack of Vitamin D causes ricketts etc etc.  Vitamin B9 (Folate or Folic Acid) cures Tropical Sprue (Oddly, this guy was indian as well, and proved ATP is the source of energy in the cell and discovered the tetracycline series antibitoics.  All of that and still didnt get Tenure at Harvard.

He's one of the least known but most influential biochemist/medical doctor of the 20th century.

The Dr. in the video is indian and goes onto to say how American Medical colleges subscibe to the Big Pharma/CDC/FDA theory of diseases.  Symptoms are caused by a virus or bacteria.  Here's a patented medicine that will work.  Why doesn't the FDA study vitamins, herbs or other naturally occurring phenomena that help.  Shoot, most of our current drugs are based on plants and other wildlife.

 * Aspirin (Salicylic Acid) from willows
 * Quinine some tree from the Amazon rainforest (cures malaria) - does have side effects for some
 * Penicillin from mould named Penicillin chrysogenum (kills Strep and Staph - some of the most common bacterial infections)
 * Codeine, morphine and heroin from the alkaloid thebaine from the poppy
 * Cocaine from the coca leaves
 * Cannabinoids come from the cannabis plant

There are plenty more..  And what researchers later discovered is that for some of these plant drugs are body had developed specific receptors for them: Cannabinoids and Opiods (morphine, heroin codeine).  And that are body MADE these drugs as well. Endorphines regulate pain in the body and are made in the body (stands for Endogenous morpine).  and we have endogenous cannibinoids too: anandmide.

We really should be looking at more plants for solutions to our problems and our diet for our immune system

Many of the above were used by historic civilizations for the same uses we use them as today.  We just studied them, added some extra molecules, patented it and sold it for huge markup. Tremendous props to Salk, who invented the polio vaccine. 

**Anecdote**: One of my best friends is from India and they have a slightly different view of medicine.  They focus on the the Germ theory like the people in the States, but they also focus on diet, nutrition and the immune system (80% of your immune system is in your gut)... Anyway, his daughter was getting white spots all over her body. They would start small and grow. One on the knee and one on her eyelid and another on her cheek. She was a darker skinned individual and this didnt look right.. She went to several specialists in USA and most of them recommended surgery.  Which is fixing the symptoms not the cause.  They went back home to visit family, saw a family friend and mentioned the condition and was referred to a doctor.  The doctor immediately knew it was something in her diet.  He asked her to remove a few things. And she did, so the Dr then knew it was one of those things.. Then she did each one by one to figure out what it was.  I think it was excess Tumeric. She removed that from her diet, spots went away.

Our bodies have survived thousands of years without medicine. Yes we need it in certain cases,  but our symptoms are a our bodies NATURAL response to something wrong.  Just like a fever is a natural response to a bacteria in the body.  And yet we take fever reducers... The fever is creating an environment were the bacteria cant grow/reproduce.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Consumul de nicotina, in doze normale produce foarte putine efecte adverse, exceptiile fiind de regula la personale cu probleme cardiovasculare existente. Fumatul, in principal datorita gudronului produs prin arderea tutunului cauzeaza majoritatea problemelor. Consumul oral de tutun poate cauza probleme daca tutunul este fermentat, de vina fiind substantele produse de microorganismele care faciliteaza fermatatia. Tutunul tratat strict termic poate cauza probleme mult mai rar, prin actiune mecanica ( mucoaselor nu le plac corpii straini, in general) sau datorita radiatiilor produse de radonul colectat de planta de tutun prin crestere. Ambele efecte asociate direct tutunului sunt mult mai putin daunatoare decat cele cauzate de fumat

A se vedea ca articolul vorbeste despre ""numarul fumatorilor"" infectati fiind mai mic, dar nu zice nimic despre rata de deces  relativa la intregul esantion. In China, rata deceselor pentru fumatorii de varsta inaintata e raportata ca fiind de 3x mai mare decat a nefumatorilor la aceasi varsta.",2
148,2020-04-22 22:07:36+00:00,"&gt; But so far, we have Josephus, Mark, and John,

It should be mentioned that the gospels are theological accounts written in light of their stories fulfilling OT scripture. So Jesus had to be buried by a ""rich man"" (Mt. 27:57) per Isaiah 53:8-9. John 19:36 even mentions that Jesus' legs weren't broken due to scriptural fulfillment. So, of course, they couldn't depict Jesus hanging and rotting on the cross even if that's what really happened. They are motivated to depict a decent burial. Not that this means the bare bones account is not historical but it should weigh in on the evaluation of the evidence. 

&gt; What sources?

I know of at least a dozen that say/imply the body was left up to rot, eaten by birds, and/or denied burial as part of the punishment - mainly found in Ehrman and Cook's work. As you mention, there is a lack of evidence in Palestine about the Roman practice but that is why I'm skeptical in accepting the historicity of the Jesus story, especially in light of the normal practice, the fact of obvious ""scriptural fulfillment,"" and the numerous implausibilities in the Joseph story, how his depiction evolves, etc.

&gt; The Pandectae makes it clear that as far as the law is concerned, bodies of those executed can be requested. If you want Semahot, then I'll have the Sententiae which also says that if someone requests the body of an executed person, it should be given to them.

Is there evidence that this applied to foreign subjects outside Rome? I don't think the Pandectae (Digesta?) even mentions crucifixion.

&gt; So you've got the source, I'm unclear why you said 'Possible for an enemy of the state guilty of sedition/treason? Where is your evidence?' when your source says it.

It says ""Those executed by the empire"" are not to be withheld ""funeral rites"" which means public mourning rites. This means, even without access to the corpse, one should still publicly mourn them which is the opposite of the command to not mourn those executed by Jewish Rabbinic courts - Sem. 2.6; cf. m. Sanh. 6.6. The text then goes on to say to count the days of mourning when you ""give up hope for asking for [the corpse]"" which assumes the bodies were not able to be obtained. So the source implies the exact opposite of it being possible to obtain the body, unless my reading is just wrong.

&gt; Good, so we allow the fact that Jews would be interested in keeping the Law. Hence the breaking of the legs and the desire for burial.

&gt; Deuteronomy is not, but Deuteronomy is talking about Jews in their own land. Given there's no origin for the Semahot text, geographical or chronological, why would it trump Jewish notions of burial? After all, Jews in Judea might have a better claim and capacity to adhere to Jewish laws than Jews in Antioch. Josephus makes it very clear that the Jews were not willing to violate the laws of their ancestors (Antiq. 8)

Good point. As for the origin, I'll need to look more into it. You mentioned ""tannaitic"" before and David W. Chapman seems to think the texts show familiarity with the tannaitic period at least - Ancient Jewish and Christian Perceptions of Crucifixion, pg. 90. But if we want to get technical about Jews ""keeping their own Laws"" that was in regards to Jewish people executed under their own Jewish law.

154,2020-04-22 12:56:38+00:00,"&gt; Ok I'm starting to wonder what the ""Palestinian"" evidence actually is? Do you mean the gospel stories and the fact that the Jews really preferred to bury their own dead? 

I suspect you may have misunderstood the original point about Crossan who imported Roman practices of dealing with the dead into Palestine as being normative everywhere, and there is a distinct lack of corroboratory evidence in Palestine confirming that Roman practice.  But so far, we have Josephus, Mark, and John, and as you want Semahot we'll add that - all writing about Palestinian events, talking about requesting bodies for burial, or hastening death for the victims. That's pretty good. Even Ludemann thinks it happened.

&gt;Therefore, that trumps all the sources which say normal practice was to leave the bodies up to rot to serve as part of the punishment?

What sources? A poem? Epitaphs?  What do we have source-wise? What legal requirements are there to leave people up on crosses? It's for you to establish a normative practices and then to show why there are never exceptions and hence why Jesus was not taken down and buried.  The Greco-Roman sources are overwhelming in their failure to state what happened to the bodies after crucifixion and we haven't even started on the linguistics of crucifixion yet. The Pandectae makes it clear that as far as the law is concerned, bodies of those executed can be requested.   If you want Semahot, then I'll have the Sententiae which also says that if someone requests the body of an executed person, it should be given to them.

&gt;At what time period did the Jews stop abiding by the commandment in Deut. 21:22-23?

Good, so we allow the fact that Jews would be interested in keeping the Law. Hence the breaking of the legs and the desire for burial.

&gt;what version are you reading?

&gt;&gt;""Those executed by the empire:

So you've got the source, I'm unclear why you said 'Possible for an enemy of the state guilty of sedition/treason? Where is your evidence?' when your source says it.

&gt;The commandment in Deut. 21:22-23 was border specific? It's a Jewish text talking about not being given the bodies when executed by a foreign government, the exact same foreign government responsible for executing Jesus. 

Deuteronomy is not, but Deuteronomy is talking about Jews in their own land. Given there's no origin for the Semahot text, geographical or chronological, why would it trump Jewish notions of burial?  After all, Jews in Judea might have a better claim and capacity to adhere to Jewish laws than Jews in Antioch.  Josephus makes it very clear that the Jews were not willing to violate the laws of their ancestors (*Antiq. 8*)

&gt;You're forgetting that Jesus was executed by the Romans though so they had the say in what happened to the body. Of course, if the Jews executed Jesus then they would have buried him.

I haven't forgotten anything - in both canon and non-canonical sources, Jesus is buried by Jews who asked for the men to die early so they could be buried, and who asked to bury the body,  in line with Jewish law, and in line with Roman law.  Pilate allows them to do so. He could have refused.",1

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

If we want to talk about the OD epidemic, I'd be glad to. These people that are ODing and dying, or getting narcaned back to life, are overdosing on heroin, or more usually, fentanyl, because they could either no longer obtain pain pills or no longer afford pain pills. You can get pain pills without tylenol, pure hydrocodone/oxycodone in a lab measured dose. That is addictive, but relatively safe all things considered. 

People were given these drugs, usually by a doctor, then became addicted and lost access to them. So they turned to street heroin thats tainted with chemicals from shitty unregulated production and laced with fentnyl. You never know the dosage. This is why people die.

Homeless people are the most entitled, enabled, un-greatful people you will ever meet. The public has no idea what is really going on. There is tons of money supporting the issue, the problem is that its waisted on stupidity.

Here are some fun facts for you:

They are almost all on disability collecting around 1100 a month. They get approved fast because if they stay anywhere as part of a program then around 450 goes directly to that program. The rest they keep and spend on haroin, side, or booze. Programs supply them with food and clothing. So they have all their needs covered and have around 600 extra a month to spend of substances of their choice.

After transitional shelter, some move onto luxury condoe's for again a fee of around 450-500 a month. Stone bathrooms, air into each unit is filtered, giant tub/shower, brand new appliances, (I have personally seen them)

Medications are free
Dental is free
Massage available off and on is free
Chiro available off and on is free
Free pot to smoke or eat (always available)
Other free drugs to get high on ( periodicly changes which ones) ( always available)

Thousands of needels are given out each year with no care whatsoever as to where they end up, it is true that users  purposely put needles in places that will be a danger to kids. I could go into detail but dont want to make this too long.

Groups that support this and distribut needles by schools are former and still current addicts. In a seminar a piece if gargadbe speaker bragged about giving them out by a school pretending the using kits were sandwiches so it looked better because they were asked to stop doing it by the school, so thats how they got around it.

Clients would poop ON thats ON the wall inside and say "" I cant clean that up I might get sick"" and then expect staff too.

Clogging toilettes is routine because they think bugs are coming out. So they end up pooping in buckets they bring in beside the toilette.

They rip copper wire out of anything they can to sell for the metal.

Lisa Helps idea is to give these kinds of clients 100 million worth or brand new real estate.

Regular people will also be renting at full price in these buildings to offset the cost. So you will have junkies, mentally unstable, high, in states of psychosis, living next to unsuspecting familys. Thats the provinces actual plan. Child endangerment is what it is!!!

Good job LISA way to distroy the city.

Who do you think will pay the cost when the buildings have to all be torn down and rebuilt from all the dammages that will happen.

By the way this was already tried and it failed, the building is barely inhabitable now.

Ending homelessness is a joke, they dont want you the tax payer to stop enabling them. 

Free living, free food, free clothing, free drugs, its a rockstar lifestyle that just doesnt look as pretty and all paid for by you and me.

Why exactly would the homeless want that to end???????? Right they wouldn't. Which is why we draw homeless from all over the country. Its not just the warm weather.

There actually is a real solution that would be cheaper safer and would provide more resources, but the government wont do it.

So instead down town will be the next east hastings and you can say good buy to the tourism industry.",1

Ja wiem, że ten niedoszły laureat nagrody Darwina miał potem jakieś nieprzyjemności, ale nawet wmawiane nam od 31 lat kłamstwo, że został rozjechany - czy to jakaś gorsza tragedia umrzeć przez swoją głupotę niż w wieku 16 lat na raka kości, gdy żadne środki przeciwbólowe nie działają? Może działała by heroina, ale jej się nie stosuje. I pewnie LSD podziałałoby lepiej na psychikę niż dobroduszne łgarstwa księdza, że będzie się opiekował z nieba nad rodziną:) mamy na to dowody naukowe od wielu lat, wiele prób klinicznych zakończonych sukcesem. Ale i wiele badań nad ketaminą w natychmiastowym leczeniu depresji (po to sowieccy naukowcy w końcu ją wymyślili) i co najwyżej w jakichś krajach 3 świata jak Polska prywatny psychiatra może wystąpić o terapię eksperymentalną (miałem ofertę od psychiatry z Gdańska, ale mój niewyparzony ryj... :)
No i jedno badanie nad stosowaniem psylocybiny(psylocyny) w formie grzybków, skuteczność większa od leków antydepresyjnych w grupie kontrolnej, ale zbyt  bardzo mała ilość  uczestników badania, brak zgody na badania na większej próbie... 
LSD/psylocybina(psylocyna)/meskalina - pewna skuteczność w leczeniu klastrowych bólów głowy przy nieskuteczności tradycyjnych leków, przy wysokim odsetku samobójstw i zaburzeń psychicznych powodowanych nawet nie bólem, ale możliwością jego powtórzenia i co? I gówno.

Yeah I Totally agree with you there. It sickens me that this a reality for some many children around the world. 



&gt;The liquor store isn’t to blame here, the parent is.

I hope are you not trying so say that the dealers are not to blame. First off they are both to blame. That woman was selfish and stupid to start doing heroin, especially in her situation of being a mother of toddlers. She made that decision on her own but the dealers they are to blame and even more so, they have to be held accountable. You can’t let them not be because this is how they justify their actions themselves. They say “ well I’m not forcing anyone to buy drugs from me” they make the false equivalency of comparing themselves to alcohol and tobacco companies.

There’s a reason that drug stores don’t sell oxycotins on the selfs for anyone to buy without a prescription. Heroin dealers are total scum, they absolutely, it’s a vile
Thing to do. They prey on the vulnerable of society, they profit from despair and description, and they know this damn well. They know that what they are selling is way different than weed or tobacco or alcohol, way worse. If it was not for people like them we would live i a way better world. They don’t just effect the person they sell too, that in turns effects the rest of us. More troubles in society, less prosperity, more violence, More thefts, more disputes, more health problems, more families ruined, so much of that go’s back to these drugs, stems from the fact that some people were willing to flood their communities with poison. 

Yes that woman was stupid and selfish for choosing drugs over her children, she is to blame but decent human beings wouldn’t exploit her, they wouldn’t supply with her such a substance which would destroy that family.",1

 A ameaça de colapso na saúde já se mostrava companheira de Mandetta, hoje com 55 anos, no primeiro ano de seu primeiro cargo público, em 2005, então [secretário de Saúde de Campo Grande](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/cotado-para-ministerio-da-saude-e-investigado-sob-suspeita-de-caixa-2-e-fraude.shtml). E também dois anos depois, quando [novamente apareceu nas páginas da **Folha**](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u130597.shtml) para se manifestar sobre a maior epidemia de dengue na capital sul-mato-grossense.

 [Demitido agora](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/em-despedida-mandetta-elogia-sus-defende-ciencia-e-manda-recados-a-bolsonaro.shtml) por Jair Bolsonaro no auge da popularidade —seu trabalho na crise do coronavírus [tinha o dobro da aprovação do próprio presidente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/aprovacao-do-ministerio-da-saude-dispara-e-e-mais-do-que-o-dobro-da-de-bolsonaro-diz-datafolha.shtml), segundo o Datafolha—, Mandetta deixou a secretaria em 2010 para se candidatar naquele ano a deputado federal.

 Acabou [eleito para dois mandatos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/11/ortopedista-deputado-do-dem-sera-ministro-da-saude-de-bolsonaro.shtml), de 2011 a 2018, tendo uma atuação mediana na Câmara, sem grandes destaques, sempre voltado à área da saúde —Mandetta é médico, com pós-graduação em ortopedia pediátrica no Brasil e nos EUA.

  Um dos momentos em que ganhou alguma projeção foi quando ingressou na linha de frente da [crítica ao programa Mais Médicos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/11/mais-medicos-era-muito-mais-convenio-de-cuba-e-pt-diz-futuro-ministro-da-saude.shtml), criado na gestão da petista Dilma Rousseff (2011-2016), para levar profissionais ao interior do país e que contava com a participação de [profissionais cubanos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/11/com-eleicao-de-bolsonaro-cuba-anuncia-fim-da-parceria-com-brasil-no-mais-medicos.shtml).

 Nesse ponto se uniu publicamente, aparentemente pela primeira vez, ao então colega de Câmara Jair Bolsonaro. Mandetta não se candidatou a deputado em 2018. A amigos dizia que pretendia voltar a Campo Grande para ficar com a família.

 Durante as eleições, porém, acabou por se tornar [um dos colaboradores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/11/bolsonaro-diz-cogitar-deputado-ortopedista-para-o-ministerio-da-saude.shtml) do programa de governo de Bolsonaro —junto, aliás, com [o nome anunciado nesta quinta-feira (16) para sucedê-lo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/novo-ministro-se-declara-alinhado-a-bolsonaro-e-diz-que-nao-havera-definicao-brusca-sobre-isolamento.shtml), o oncologista [Nelson Teich](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/favorito-para-a-saude-e-ligado-ao-bolsonarismo-mas-defende-isolamento-social.shtml).

 O esforço ajudou o então deputado a ser escolhido para o ministério. Sua indicação foi atribuída à bancada parlamentar da área da saúde e ao atual governador de Goiás, Ronaldo Caiado (DEM), [hoje rompido com o presidente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/caiado-rompe-com-bolsonaro-e-diz-que-nao-respeitara-decisoes-do-presidente.shtml).

 Mandetta já estreou na função de ministro [sob a pressão do desmanche do Mais Médicos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/02/ministerio-estuda-rever-mais-medicos-em-cidades-do-brasil-intermediario.shtml). Com isso, estabeleceu como sua principal vitrine o lançamento de um substituto, [batizado de Médicos pelo Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/08/governo-lanca-medicos-pelo-brasil-em-substituicao-ao-mais-medicos.shtml).

 A proposta, lançada só em agosto de 2019, previa a contratação de [até 18 mil médicos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/02/reduzido-mais-medicos-ganha-sobrevida-com-retorno-de-cubanos.shtml) por meio de seleção com prova objetiva, com contratação em carteira de trabalho e pagamento cujo valor varia conforme a etapa de atuação, local onde o médico está inserido e progressão na carreira, além de novo critério de distribuição de profissionais.

 A medida agradou entidades médicas e ao presidente, que [usou o lançamento para fazer ataques a médicos cubanos e ao PT](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/08/se-cubanos-fossem-bons-teriam-salvado-a-vida-de-chavez-diz-bolsonaro-ao-lancar-novo-mais-medicos.shtml), alvos favoritos durante e após a campanha eleitoral. No Congresso, a medida [quase caducou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/11/governo-ja-ve-risco-para-novo-mais-medicos-em-2020-diante-de-impasse-no-congresso.shtml), porém, e acabou [aprovada no fim do prazo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/11/camara-aprova-projeto-que-permite-revalidacao-de-diploma-de-medicina-por-universidades-privadas.shtml).

 Inicialmente, Mandetta falava em ter um programa em execução ainda no fim do ano, mas não conseguiu.

 Atrasos na [criação de uma agência](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/07/governo-quer-criar-agencia-para-gerir-selecao-e-contratos-em-novo-mais-medicos.shtml) que será responsável por gerir os contratos impediram o lançamento da primeira seleção, e Mandetta voltou a [ter que recorrer ao Mais Médicos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/03/contra-coronavirus-governo-quer-posto-de-saude-noturno-e-novo-edital-do-mais-medicos.shtml) em meio a pandemia do coronavírus, que devastou o planejamento anterior da pasta.

 Apesar da oposição ao Mais Médicos, o governo foi obrigado a lançar em março deste ano [um edital para reincluir no programa 1.800 cubanos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/governo-abre-edital-que-permite-reincluir-1800-cubanos-no-mais-medicos.shtml) que ficaram no Brasil após o [rompimento](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/11/veja-como-funciona-o-mais-medicos-e-o-que-foi-feito-para-repor-as-vagas-dos-cubanos.shtml) dos contratos entre Cuba e Opas (Organização Pan-americana de Saúde).

 Ao ingressar no ministério, Mandetta adotou na pasta, em certa medida, uma prática que na campanha foi tratada como um dos vícios a serem sanados em caso de vitória de Bolsonaro, o do [aparelhamento político](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/celso-rocha-de-barros/2019/08/aparelhamento-bolsonarista.shtml) de cargos públicos.

 Ele [levou para a pasta ex-deputados federais do DEM](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/veja-quem-e-quem-no-ministerio-de-mandetta-que-bolsonaro-deve-demitir.shtml), seus aliados: José Carlos Aleluia (DEM-BA), assessor especial, e Abelardo Lupion (DEM-PR), diretor de gestão. Os dois, inclusive, receberam uma menção especial na [entrevista coletiva de despedida de Mandetta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/em-despedida-mandetta-elogia-sus-defende-ciencia-e-manda-recados-a-bolsonaro.shtml), nesta quinta.

 O agora ex-ministro os nominou e os classificou de experientes conselheiros que auxiliaram seu trabalho no governo.

 Para além do Médicos pelo Brasil, os [cem primeiros dias da gestão de Mandetta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/04/em-cem-dias-ministro-da-saude-freia-anuncios-e-tenta-evitar-radicalizacao.shtml) no ministério foram marcados por poucos anúncios e uma lista crescente de intenções. A gestão passou a dar os primeiros resultados após a reorganização das secretarias da pasta.

 Entre elas, o ministro criou uma específica para a atenção básica, que responde pelo atendimento em unidades de saúde.

 Ao mesmo tempo, recebeu críticas por transformar o departamento de HIV e Aids [em um departamento de doenças crônicas](https://painel.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/05/22/ministerio-da-saude-rebaixa-departamento-de-combate-a-aids-a-uma-coordenadoria/), retirando a visibilidade na [luta contra a doença](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/opiniao/2019/12/aids-retrocessos-inaceitaveis.shtml).

 Campanhas [contra a Aids](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/02/pessoa-com-hiv-e-uma-despesa-para-todos-no-brasil-diz-bolsonaro.shtml), aliás, perderam o foco na chamada prevenção combinada —nome dado aos modelos múltiplos de prevenção— na gestão de Mandetta. Gays, lésbicas e transexuais também saíram de cena.

 Antes do coronavírus, o ministro era considerado avesso a polêmicas.

 Ao receber uma proposta de apoio a uma [campanha de abstinência sexual](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/02/sem-citar-preservativos-campanha-contra-gravidez-na-adolescencia-foca-em-reflexao.shtml), tentou adotar um tom conciliador, chegando a fazer com que entendessem que era contra [a proposta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/01/abstinencia-proposta-por-damares-nao-vai-vingar-dizem-jovens.shtml).

 Na prática, porém, Mandetta liberou recursos para uma [campanha focada em “reflexão”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidia",1

Bag for a long time. It’s been a big part of our culture for so long, So many people have consumed it,
It’s a liquid, It’s a beverage, It’s easy to
make and it’s simple to consume. All of these factors add up. Alcohol causes a lot of issues in our society but The thing is the overwhelming number of people can consume Alcohol and not have it ever be a problem.
I hate when people say the prohibition of alcohol was a failure. I am firmly against alcohol prohibition but the prohibition act was not a failure, it was a success. The goal was to reduce alcohol consumption and they nearly cut consumption in half with weak enforcement of the law. It actually took decades after the repeal for consumption levels to reach prior levels. So when you take Into all these accounts, it was an astounding success. Also this notion that prohibition created organized crime is bullshit, and prohibition did not increase violence, Overall there was less violence in that period because of the drop in drunken disputes and fights , yes there were gang warfare over bootlegging which made the big headlines but this was not all that common and a not a big effect on the overall of the citizenry. 


I think when it comes to drugs and issues regarding prohibition, you see a very naive circle jerk on the internet. Theres a lot of ignorant sentiments. People saying that all drugs should be legal because people are going to do them anyway, they say you can regulate it and make the drugs safer. They say will we rid of the cartels and make everything so fine and dandy... people Are fucking stupid.  “ the war on drugs blah blah blah “ also a lot of dumbasses don’t know  there’s a difference between legalize and decriminalize.


First off this notion that the  people who support prohibition are stupid and that they must think they can totally Get rid of drugs, obviously the feds know they can’t get rid of drugs, the prohibitionists in 1920 never had the intention or slight thought of ever being totally bedridden of alcohol. It’s never been about totally Getting rid of drugs, it’s about reducing and containing it as much as you can. it’s about preventing the flood gates from opening. This idea that the war on drugs is pointless because you can’t win because winning would be getting rid of drugs is so silly.. you win by keeping it under control. Far more people would do these drugs if they were legal and if they were not being combated, it’s a fucking fact, it’s not rocket science. It’s no surprise that weed use is going up and up, and that’s something I’m fine with because drugs are not equals, I think we can tolerate Weed unlike all this other poison. 

Coming to the talking point about if drugs were legal
Then we could regulate them so no one would get laced drugs.. again so naive. First off these drugs themselves are what’s dangerous, without being laced. Most people overdose on clean drugs. Way more people would die if these substances could Legally be sold to anyone  for recreational use regardless of a guaranteed clean product. Theres a reason there drug you need a prescription for, there’s a reason we don’t sell oxycotin To anyone who simply wants it. 

On to The cartel talking point. The notion that if all drugs were legal It would get rid the cartels... it’s beyond cretinous. Even in a wacky world where legitimate corporations profit from recreational cocaine, the cartels would still be profiting. Of course they want a stranglehold on the market, they want as less competition as possible and the biggest piece of the lie as they can get. Does anyone Seriously think the cartels would call It a day ? That they couldn’t profit from a drug if it were legal? What organized crime groups do is they infiltrate legitimate industry by using illegitimate strong arm tactics to profit and gain control. 
Narcotics are obviously the main racket for the cartels but it’s far from being the only thing. Their rackets include all forms of theft and fraud, weapons trafficking, human/sex trafficking, theft, counterfeiting, illegal gambling, extortion, racketeering. They make hundreds of millions of dollars from avocados and they are in on the legal weed industry as well, best believe it. These fuckers are relentless vultures. A lot of people really don’t know what they are talking about when it comes to the cartels. This notion that there would be less violence if it won’t for the war on drugs is just so wrong and misguided.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

I'm more than happy to buy 1 joint worth of weed for  20 rupees. And it's good quality, locally grown stuff. Obviously not as good as top tier Himalayan or Malana stuff, but it gets the job done pretty well.

Weed isn't usually spiked in the first place. 20% rat poison? You pulled that right out of your ass. Smoking something will probably instantly kill a person. Even if things are spiked, they're spiked with other drugs like fetanyl. Most dealers won't waste it on weed because it isn't very effective. Instead, heroin or acid, or similar hard drugs are usually spiked. Spiking weed mostly results in a loss, hence, many dealers don't practice it.

257,2020-04-16 01:06:46+00:00,"I know you said this ins't going anywhere, and you're probably right, but I hate reading a response and not responding.

&gt;well it’s important to decide which are literally real and which are not because that changes the story it tells. if i selectively change parts of a random fictional story from meant as literal to meant as metaphor its no longer the same story.

&gt;for example: harry potter.

&gt;depending on exactly what i change from metaphor to reality or from reality to metaphor the story could be a poor orphin kid on an acid trip who learns what it means to be a hero. or an average wizard who dreams of fame but isnt truly famous.

Let's take your Harry Potter example and apply it to the creation story in Genesis. If it's literal it is describing how God created two humans, put them in a garden, they started to sin, and were cast out. If it's metaphorical it's a metaphor for the Big Bang and evolution leading to humans and why humans do bad things. You're probably saying ""Exactly! And since those are two different stories it is relevant to know which one it is!"" But that is missing the point. The point is not what happened in the story. The point is the underlying message of the story. The moral of the story if you will. And that stays the same whether it is literal or metaphorical.

What do you think I mean by relevant? Obviously the story changes depending on if it's literal or not, but does that matter? When I'm talking about relevance I'm talking about whether or not it affects the core claim of Christianity, which is the fact that Jesus died and rose again for our sins. As long as it being literal or figurative does not affect that, then it doesn't matter which it is as far as Christianity is concerned.

In other contexts it may be relevant to figure out whether the story as described literally happened or not, but in the context of Christianity that is not the case. As far as Christianity is concerned, to know whether it is relevant whether or not an event described is literal, you have to ask ""Does this impact the fact that Jesus died and rose again for our sins?"". 
If yes, then it's important to know. If not, then it really isn't relevant, because the central message of Christianity, that Jesus died and rose again for our sins, does not change.

&gt;and when you mentioned what was true and what wasn’t it seemed like a lot of your justification is “because christianity doesnt work without it” (paraphrasing of course). which is definitely not a good reason to decide what to keep and what not. it feels rather circular.

Really, I give a whole multi-paragraph explanation on how the situation is different vis-a-vis the creation story and the resurrection and you reduce it to this one small part of the argument? Anyway, it would be circular if I didn't have any other reason that I believe in Christianity. But I do have reasoning other than this for why I believe Christianity is true and why I believe the resurrection happened, but since that would be touching more on an argument for Christianity being true, which is not the subject of this discussion, I didn't bring that in. Because of that other reasoning for being a Christian it is no longer circular.

&gt;which is definitely not a good reason to decide what to keep and what not

I'm confused by this mention of ""keeping"" something. Do you think I throw out and ignore the parts of the Bible that I believe are metaphorical? Not at all. Even the metaphorical parts are of great use.

&gt;And you use sort of a modified occums razor to compare them which is “it takes more to make genesis real than for the resurrection to be real”. the problem with this is that if god is god then both stories are equally simple to make true because god is all powerful. so if god really exists then logic and reason are off the table because god is fully capable of doing anything he wants regardless of what is likely or what science has found to be true.

Firstly, that part of my logic is not where I use Occam's razor (though I do use it later). All that part of my logic is saying that if God's miracle needed to explain the event being literal is incompatible with the science it contradicts being otherwise true, then it is almost surely metaphorical, while if the necessary miracle is not incompatible with the science it contradicts being otherwise true, then it might be literal. It doesn't matter which is simpler.

Secondly, your argument here makes no sense. Just because God can do anything doesn't mean any explanation involving God is equally simple. That conclusion doesn't follow from the premise, and I reject your assertion on its face.

&gt;also cherry picking what is metaphor and what is literal based on internal reasons that differ from person to person,

My entire argument was that it is not based on internal reasons.

&gt;means that anything undesirable about the bible (of which theres plenty) you can just say “oh well that parts a metaphor so it doesn’t count”. which is problematic.

One can believe the Bible is a mixture of literal and metaphor without doing this though.

&gt;but you say there’s supposedly objective reasons and yet everyone seems to decide differently what is metaphor and what isnt which to me suggests its rather subjective.

People can sometimes be wrong. I'm probably wrong in some cases. People can get a math problem wrong too, but the math problem still has an objectively true answer.

Additionally you are vastly overestimating the disagreement about what is literal and what is metaphor. Certain things are considered literal by all Christians, such as Jesus' resurrection (this is by definition since anyone who doesn't believe this is literal cannot be a Christian by definition). The people who don't believe the Bible is literal are generally in agreement about what they don't think is literal or about what is impossible to know for certain is literal. People aren't randomly picking and choosing things they like to be ""literal"" and throwing out things they dislike as ""metaphorical"".

&gt;evidence to the subjectivity of this is the fact that beliefs range from 100% literal to “only exactly what we need for Christianity to be real” is literal. you seem to lean towards the latter

Where are you getting that I lean towards the latter? I'd say over 90% of the Bible is literal. You have to understand, a lot of the events in the Bible aren't even supernatural or controversial, especially a lot of the Old Testament histories describing the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah. Most of that I'd say is literal because there's no reason to believe otherwise, though perhaps some of those mundane stories are actually metaphorical as well. Again, for most things it really doesn't matter, because the symbolism and message of the story is the same, and it doesn't affect the core claim of Christianity that Jesus died and rose again for our sins.",1

Ele admitiu que há um ""descompasso"" com o Palácio do Planalto e repetiu que só tem o caminho da ciência a oferecer.

 ""Estamos aqui eu, Wanderson e Gabbardo. Entramos juntos, estamos juntos e sairemos do ministério juntos"", disse Mandetta em entrevista coletiva no Planalto. ""Vamos trabalhar juntos até o momento de sairmos juntos do Ministério da Saúde.""

 O ministro reforçou que não cogita neste momento pedir demissão de seu cargo. De acordo com Mandetta, existem apenas três hipóteses que podem afastá-lo do ministério.

 ""Uma quando o presidente não quiser mais o meu trabalho. O segundo é, imagine, que eu pegue uma gripe dessa e tenha que ser afastado. E a terceira quando eu sentir que o trabalho feito já não é mais necessário porque de alguma maneira passamos por esse estresse.""

 Também na tarde desta quarta-feira Bolsonaro voltou a minimizar a gravidade da Covid-19, ao compartilhar em suas redes sociais uma tabela que mostra o Brasil com 7 mortes a cada 1 milhão de habitantes, atrás de países como Espanha, Itália e França.

 Segundo antecipou a coluna Painel, da **Folha**, [Mandetta avisou sua equipe](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/04/mandetta-avisa-equipe-que-bolsonaro-procura-nome-para-substitui-lo-e-que-vai-ser-demitido.shtml) na noite desta terça-feira (14) que Bolsonaro já procura um nome para o seu lugar. O ministro conversou com integrantes da pasta em clima de despedida e avisou que combinou de esperar a escolha do substituto.

 Mandetta afirmou a interlocutores que cometeu um erro ao dar a [entrevista ao Fantástico no último domingo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/brasileiro-nao-sabe-se-escuta-o-ministro-ou-o-presidente-diz-mandetta.shtml) (12), com uma série de críticas indiretas a Bolsonaro, e reconheceu que, diante disso, seu cargo está novamente ameaçado.

 Depois de escapar na semana passada de uma demissão que muitos consideravam certa, o ministro foi avisado que sua saída do governo federal voltou a ser uma possibilidade nos próximos dias.

 Além da visível [perda de sustentação entre os militares](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-quer-forcar-mandetta-a-pedir-demissao-apos-ministro-perder-apoio-entre-militares.shtml), que consideraram o tom da entrevista um ato de insubordinação, Bolsonaro leva em conta que até mesmo alguns líderes do Congresso criticaram o tom adotado na entrevista do ministro.

 A falta de fortes mobilizações nas redes sociais em defesa do titular da Saúde também foi lida pelo presidente como uma brecha para efetuar a demissão.

 Na entrevista à TV Globo, Mandetta disse que a população não sabe se deve seguir as recomendações do Ministério da Saúde (favorável ao isolamento social) ou de Bolsonaro (crítico de medidas como o fechamento de comércios, por exemplo).

 O titular da Saúde também criticou quem rompe as regras de distanciamento para ir à padaria, numa crítica a Bolsonaro —o [presidente foi na semana passada a um estabelecimento do tipo em Brasília](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/04/mandetta-viu-armadilha-em-visita-de-bolsonaro-a-mesma-padaria-que-frequenta.shtml) e consumiu alimentos no balcão.

 Justamente essa insistência em bater de frente com Bolsonaro custou a Mandetta o apoio da ala militar no Palácio do Planalto.

 A avaliação foi a de que o ministro desprezou o esforço do núcleo militar para que ele fosse mantido no cargo e está preocupado apenas com a sua imagem pública, em uma tentativa de se candidatar a governador de Mato Grosso do Sul em 2022 —Mandetta vinha dando seguidos sinais de enfrentamento ao presidente desde a ameaça de sua demissão na semana passada, sendo a entrevista o último deles.

 O descontentamento do grupo fardado ficou evidente nesta terça-feira (14) com uma declaração do vice-presidente, general Hamilton Mourão. Em entrevista ao jornal O Estado de S. Paulo, Mourão afirmou que o ministro da Saúde cometeu uma falta grave na fala à TV Globo.

 ""​Cruzou a linha da bola, não precisava ter dito determinadas coisas"", afirmou o vice. Mourão, no entanto, avaliou que o melhor seria o presidente não demitir o auxiliar neste momento.

 Durante a segunda-feira, Mandetta conversou com aliados. Justificou que decidiu dar a entrevista porque ficou irritado com o comportamento de Bolsonaro no sábado (11), durante uma [visita a obras de um hospital de campanha em Águas Lindas de Goiás](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-visita-obra-de-hospital-provoca-novas-aglomeracoes-e-e-criticado-por-mandetta-e-caiado.shtml) (GO).

 Na ocasião, o mandatário mais uma vez ignorou orientações das autoridades sanitárias e promoveu aglomerações —o titular da Saúde acompanhou a cena de longe.

 Os interlocutores que conversaram com o ministro na segunda disseram que ele reafirmou que não pediria demissão, mas reconheceu que estava numa situação de maior debilidade do que na semana passada.

 A relação entre Bolsonaro e Mandetta nunca foi próxima, sempre foi protocolar. O ministro foi indicado ao cargo pelo governador de Goiás, Ronaldo Caiado (DEM), aliado de primeira hora do presidente, mas [hoje rompido com ele por divergências na conduta de combate ao coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/caiado-rompe-com-bolsonaro-e-diz-que-nao-respeitara-decisoes-do-presidente.shtml).

 Pela falta de afinidade com Mandetta, Bolsonaro chegou a cogitar a sua substituição em setembro do ano passado, mas desistiu ao constatar que ele tinha amplo apoio junto ao setor da saúde.

 No início da pandemia do coronavírus, o presidente se queixou ao ministro de que ele deveria defender mais o governo e o repreendeu por ter participado de uma entrevista ao lado do governador de São Paulo, João Doria (PSDB), adversário político de Bolsonaro.

 Mandetta modulou sua retórica e passou a pregar a importância de a atividade econômica não parar. Ele, no entanto, não se dobrou à pressão do presidente contra a medida de isolamento social, o que iniciou o embate entre ambos.​

 A crise com Mandetta abalou Bolsonaro. Segundo assessores presidenciais, pela primeira vez desde que assumiu o cargo, o presidente receou estar perdendo capital político ao constatar que parte da base bolsonarista nas redes sociais apoia o ministro. Nas últimas semanas, Bolsonaro chegou a afirmar que falta humildade a Mandetta e que ele extrapolou.

 ### MANDETTA CONFRONTA PRESIDENTE

 **Enquadramento**  
 No dia 6 de abril, um dia depois de ameaçar “usar a caneta” contra ministros que “viraram estrelas”, Bolsonaro foi questionado por Mandetta sobre o motivo pelo qual não o demitia. A pergunta surgiu em reunião de ministros; o presidente, segundo relatos, não respondeu. Ministros militares, em parte responsáveis por demover Bolsonaro da ideia de exonerar o titular da pasta da Saúde, tentaram contornar a situação. Mandetta também perguntou por que fora nomeado, já que o presidente não o ouvia

265,2020-04-15 17:02:32+00:00," Um dos principais nomes do Ministério da Saúde à frente das ações de controle do coronavírus, o secretário de vigilância em saúde, Wanderson Oliveira, pediu demissão na manhã desta quarta-feira (15).

 A informação foi confirmada pela pasta. Mais cedo, Oliveira já tinha divulgado uma carta à equipe, como revelou a coluna da Mônica Bergamo, da **Folha**. O pedido de exoneração ocorre após o ministro Luiz Henrique Mandetta (Saúde) avisar à equipe que será demitido da pasta até sexta-feira.

 Além de Oliveira, o secretário Denizar Vianna (Ciência, Tecnologia e Insumos Estratégicos), também deu sinais de que deve sair caso a exoneração do ministro se confirme.

 Com receio de ver os trabalhos descontinuados, auxiliares de Mandetta deram ordens à equipe para que acelerem a publicação de trabalhos técnicos que já estejam em fase de finalização para no máximo quinta-feira (16).

 Mais cedo, Oliveira pediu a diretores que fizessem um balanço das ações de suas áreas para uma eventual troca de gestão. Pedido semelhante foi reforçado por Mandetta em reunião nesta quarta. Na ocasião, o ministro orientou a equipe a acelerar ações para mostrar que a pasta cumpriu o que havia prometido fazer.

  Na manhã desta quarta-feira, o presidente Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido) disse que resolverá ""a questão da Saúde"" para que seja possível ""tocar o barco"". A expectativa no Ministério da Saúde é que Mandetta seja demitido do comando da pasta até o final desta semana.

 ""Pessoal, estou fazendo a minha parte"", disse o presidente a apoiadores que o aguardavam na frente do Palácio do Alvorada pela manhã. ""Resolveremos a questão da Saúde no Brasil para tocar o barco"", afirmou.

 O presidente não quis falar com a imprensa. Dos apoiadores que diariamente se aglomeram em frente da residência oficial, ouviu cobranças, o que o deixou incomodado. ""Pessoal, se eu parar aqui para ouvir cada um com um problema, não paro mais"", disse.

 Bolsonaro, contrário às recomendações do Ministério da Saúde e da maioria dos especialistas no combate ao coronavírus, planeja [desconstruir a imagem de ""herói"" que](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ministro-admite-que-avancou-sinal-e-bolsonaro-tenta-desconstruir-heroi-mandetta.shtml)[ Mandetta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ministro-admite-que-avancou-sinal-e-bolsonaro-tenta-desconstruir-heroi-mandetta.shtml) adquiriu para grande parte da opinião pública na pandemia. O objetivo é criar condições políticas para demiti-lo.

O ministro conversou com integrantes da pasta em clima de [despedida](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/atitude-de-mandetta-de-confronto-com-bolsonaro-reduz-apoio-de-militares-a-ministro.shtml). De acordo com relatos, Mandetta avisou que combinou de esperar a escolha do substituto.

 No início da semana, Mandetta afirmou a interlocutores que cometeu um erro ao dar a [entrevista ao Fantástico](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/brasileiro-nao-sabe-se-escuta-o-ministro-ou-o-presidente-diz-mandetta.shtml) no último domingo (12), com uma série de críticas indiretas ao presidente, e reconheceu que, diante disso, seu cargo está novamente ameaçado.

 Depois de escapar na semana passada de uma [demissão que muitos consideravam certa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-avalia-demitir-mandetta-da-saude-sofre-pressao-e-ministro-diz-que-fica.shtml), o ministro foi avisado que sua saída do governo federal voltou a ser uma possibilidade nos próximos dias.

 Além da visível perda de sustentação entre os militares, que consideraram o tom da entrevista um ato de insubordinação, Bolsonaro levou em conta que até mesmo [alguns líderes do Congresso](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/04/e-hora-de-mais-trabalho-e-menos-entrevista-diz-lider-do-pp-em-critica-a-mandetta.shtml) criticaram o tom adotado na entrevista do ministro.

 A falta de fortes mobilizações nas [redes sociais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/em-embate-com-bolsonaro-mandetta-dispara-em-popularidade-digital-e-supera-lula-e-huck.shtml) em defesa do titular da Saúde também foi lida pelo presidente como uma brecha para efetuar a demissão.

 Na entrevista à TV Globo, domingo, Mandetta disse que a população não sabe se deve seguir as recomendações do Ministério da Saúde (favorável ao isolamento social) ou de Bolsonaro (crítico de medidas como o fechamento de comércios, por exemplo).

 O titular da Saúde também criticou quem rompe as regras de distanciamento para ir à padaria, numa crítica a Bolsonaro —o presidente foi na semana passada a um estabelecimento do tipo em Brasília e consumiu alimentos no balcão.

 **Críticas ao presidente em Goiás**  
 No sábado (11), depois de Bolsonar",1
266,2020-04-15 17:02:21+00:00," Em meio ao início de um movimento de [debandada de secretários do Ministério da Saúde](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/com-mandetta-de-saida-bolsonaro-fala-em-resolver-questao-da-saude-para-tocar-o-barco.shtml), a equipe do presidente Jair Bolsonaro acelerou a busca por um substituto do ministro Luiz Henrique Mandetta, que já avisou auxiliares de sua demissão nos próximos dias.

 Entre os cotados estão médicos de fora da pasta e o número 2 do ministério, João Gabbardo. Um dos médicos sugeridos a Bolsonaro é Claudio Lottenberg, que conta com apoio de [Fabio Wajngarten](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/entenda-a-polemica-sobre-o-chefe-da-secom-de-bolsonaro-fabio-wajngarten.shtml), secretário Especial de Comunicação Social da Presidência.

 Bolsonaro também tem simpatia pelo cardiologista Otávio Berwanger, que, no início do mês, participou de reunião com um grupo de médicos no Planalto. O entorno do presidente, no entanto, avalia que ele dificilmente aceitaria.

 Uma parte da [ala militar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/ala-militar-tenta-controlar-crise-em-meio-a-insatisfacao-com-bolsonaro-e-guedes.shtml), preocupada com uma política de continuidade, tenta emplacar o nome de Gabbardo, secretário-executivo, como possibilidade de solução temporária.

 Ainda numa solução caseira, a oncologista Maria Inez Gadelha,​ que atua na Secretaria de Atenção à Saúde, também está na bolsa de apostas. A servidora conta com apoio sobretudo na bancada federal da Saúde.

  Com a piora na relação com o ministro, que [perdeu apoio substancial no Palácio do Planalto](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/atitude-de-mandetta-de-confronto-com-bolsonaro-reduz-apoio-de-militares-a-ministro.shtml), o presidente foi aconselhado a efetuar uma troca nesta semana, antes que Mandetta volte a ganhar força.

 A equipe do ministro ligada ao combate da pandemia começou um movimento para deixar a pasta. Principal nome à frente das ações de controle do [coronavírus](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/13/5900-acompanhe-todas-as-informacoes-sobre-a-pandemia-de-coronavirus.shtml), o secretário de vigilância em saúde do Ministério da Saúde, Wanderson Oliveira, pediu demissão na manhã desta quarta-feira (15).

 A informação foi confirmada pela pasta. Mais cedo, Oliveira já tinha divulgado uma carta à equipe, como [revelou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/04/equipe-de-mandetta-teme-demissao-por-twitter-e-ja-anuncia-debandada.shtml) a coluna da Mônica Bergamo. Além de Oliveira, o secretário Denizar Vianna (Ciência, Tecnologia e Insumos Estratégicos), também deu sinais de que deve sair caso a exoneração do ministro se confirme.

 Com receio de ver os trabalhos descontinuados, auxiliares de Mandetta deram ordens à equipe para que acelerem a publicação de trabalhos técnicos que já estejam em fase de finalização para no máximo quinta-feira (16).

 Mais cedo, Oliveira pediu a diretores que fizessem um balanço das ações de suas áreas para uma eventual troca de gestão. Pedido semelhante foi reforçado por Mandetta em reunião nesta quarta. Na ocasião, o ministro orientou a equipe a acelerar ações para mostrar que a pasta cumpriu o que havia prometido fazer.

 ​Aliados do presidente buscam um nome que traga confiabilidade e não provoque mais estrecimentos ao governo em meio à pandemia, que se aproxima de seu período mais crítico.

 Inicialmente, Bolsonaro fazia questão de nomear alguém que fosse alinhado a ele na defesa [do que chama de ""isolamento vertical""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/exercito-tira-do-ar-estudo-que-defende-forma-de-isolamento-que-contraria-bolsonaro.shtml), focado apenas em grupos de risco, e na utilização da [hidroxicloroquina](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/cloroquina-esta-sendo-vista-como-salvadora-mas-nao-e-diz-medica-do-incor.shtml) em pacientes em fase inicial da doença.

 No entanto, ele passou, de acordo com aliados, a aceitar uma alternativa que, embora tenh​a uma visão diferente da dele no combate à doença, não adote posição de confronto ou o desautorize em público.

 A ideia principal, como reafirmou um ministro do governo, é escalar alguém que ajude a reduzir um eventual desgaste público com a saída de Mandetta.

 Por outro lado, há uma preocupação com a transição na Saúde, para que a saída do atual ministro não se dê sem que haja memória do trabalho produzido até aqui, com mais de um mês de crise.

 Conta a favor de Gabbardo o fato de o secretário ter cortado perguntas em entrevistas que pudessem contrapor Bolsonaro às recomendações do ministério, como saídas para pontos de comércio de Brasília. Há, porém, quem veja nele um forte aliado de Mandetta por ter se mostrado fiel ao ministro em algumas aparições públicas.

 De acordo com relatos feitos à** Folha**, Gabbardo não chegou a ser convidado e ainda há dúvidas de que aceitaria a missão.

 Aliados de Bolsonaro se esforçam para construir um grupo de indicações. Há uma ala que defende que Mandetta seja substituído por um médico de renome, afastado de polêmicas. Há uma preferência para profissionais de hospitais de referência, como Albert Einstein, onde Bolsonaro foi tratado após facada sofrida em 2018.

 Alinhados a Bolsonaro, o deputado federal [Osmar Terra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/04/osmar-terra-volta-a-cometer-erros-ao-falar-de-coronavirus-apos-desmoralizacao.shtml) (MDB-RS) e o diretor-presidente da Anvisa (Agência Nacional da Vigilância Sanitária), [Antônio Barra Torres](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/presidente-da-anvisa-se-alinha-a-bolsonaro-e-contrapoe-mandetta-no-combate-ao-coronavirus.shtml), chegaram a ser inicialmente favoritos para o posto.

 O perfil político e a amizade de ambos com o presidente, no entanto, são apontados como empecilhos para uma indicação. Segundo deputados bolsonaristas, eles só serão efetivados caso o presidente não encontre alguém de peso.

 Convidada para participar do comitê de crise, a médica [Nise Yamaguchi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/medica-entusiasta-da-cloroquina-contra-covid-19-ja-defendeu-outras-terapias-sem-evidencias.shtml), que defende o uso de hidroxicloroquina, chegou a ser sondada, mas ela não teria demonstrado disposição em assumir o cargo.​​

 Desde a semana retrasada, o presidente já [havia decidido trocar o comando da pasta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-avalia-demitir-mandetta-da-saude-sofre-pressao-e-ministro-diz-que-fica.shtml), mas tinha receio da repercussão de uma mudança em meio à pandemia de coronavírus.​​

267,2020-04-15 16:03:02+00:00," Os líderes do DEM no Congresso, o deputado federal Efraim Filho (PB) e o senador Rodrigo Pacheco (MG), afirmaram na manhã desta quarta-feira (15) que se Jair Bolsonaro [confirmar a decisão de demitir Luiz Henrique Mandetta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ministro-admite-que-avancou-sinal-e-bolsonaro-tenta-desconstruir-heroi-mandetta.shtml) (Saúde), que é do partido, cometerá um grande equívoco e terá que arcar com as consequências do que ocorrer no país.

 ""Ao Presidente Bolsonaro naturalmente caberá a decisão e as consequências sobre a demissão do Mandetta. Será uma péssima notícia para o Brasil"", afirmou Efraim.

 Pacheco diz que se Bolsonaro efetivar a demissão do auxiliar, cometerá um grande equívoco.

 ""O ministro Mandetta atua com base em fundamentos técnicos, com base em ciência, e dentro dos [padrões da Organização Mundial de Saúde](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/brasileiros-estao-minimizando-risco-afirma-diretora-da-oms.shtml), que é seguida pela maioria dos países que tem enfrentado o [coronavirus](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/13/5900-acompanhe-todas-as-informacoes-sobre-a-pandemia-de-coronavirus.shtml). Aqueles que não enfrentaram da forma como o Mandetta está sugerindo estão arcando com as consequências tardiamente e gravemente"", disse o senador.

 Os líderes da bancada do DEM manifestaram ainda desconforto com a [atitude do Onyx Lorenzoni](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/04/onyx-lorenzoni-deu-demonstracao-de-submissao-a-bolsonaro-avaliam-membros-do-dem.shtml), ministro da Cidadania, que também é do partido e que em entrevista coletiva nesta terça (14) fez questão, ao lado de Mandetta, de reafirmar lealdade incondicional a Bolsonaro, em um claro recado crítico ao colega.

  ""O Onyx não está sendo desleal, está sendo coerente com o que ele fez desde que surgiu o Bolsonaro. Ele sempre esteve ao lado do presidente. Só que nesse momento ele está fazendo uma opção de ficar ao lado do presidente Bolsonaro, quando o caminho correto é o caminho da ciência externado pelo ministro da saúde. E o ministro Onyx obviamente vai arcar com as consequências de suas opções, como todos vão arcar com as consequências de sua opções"", afirmou Rodrigo Pacheco.

 Para Efraim, Onyx —que [foi deslocado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/bolsonaro-anuncia-onyx-na-cidadania-e-general-braga-netto-na-casa-civil.shtml) da Casa Civil pra Cidadania em uma movimentação considerada de rebaixamento pelo DEM—, manteve a mesma narrativa externada no [diálogo com o ex-ministro Osmar Terr](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/dialogo-mostra-osmar-terra-oferecendo-ajuda-a-onyx-para-trocar-mandetta.shtml)a (MDB), divulgado pela CNN Brasil, em que ambos defenderam a demissão de Mandetta.

 ""É um assunto entre os dois [Onyx e Mandetta], que tinham uma amizade de mais de dez anos juntos.""

 Conforme [revelou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/04/mandetta-avisa-equipe-que-bolsonaro-procura-nome-para-substitui-lo-e-que-vai-ser-demitido.shtml) a coluna Painel nesta terça, o ministro da Saúde já avisou à sua equipe que será demitido por Bolsonaro.

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

271,2020-04-15 14:04:16+00:00," O presidente Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido) disse nesta quarta-feira (15) que resolverá ""a questão da Saúde"" para que seja possível ""tocar o barco"". A expectativa no Ministério da Saúde é que Luiz Henrique Mandetta seja demitido do comando da pasta até o final desta semana.

 ""Pessoal, estou fazendo a minha parte"", disse o presidente a apoiadores que o aguardavam na frente do Palácio do Alvorada pela manhã. ""Resolveremos a questão da Saúde no Brasil para tocar o barco"", afirmou.

 O presidente não quis falar com a imprensa. Dos apoiadores que diariamente se aglomeram em frente da residência oficial, ouviu cobranças, o que o deixou incomodado. ""Pessoal, se eu parar aqui para ouvir cada um com um problema, não paro mais"", disse.

 Bolsonaro, contrário às recomendações do Ministério da Saúde e da maioria dos especialistas no combate ao coronavírus, planeja [desconstruir a imagem de ""herói"" que o ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ministro-admite-que-avancou-sinal-e-bolsonaro-tenta-desconstruir-heroi-mandetta.shtml)[ministro Luiz Henrique Mandetta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ministro-admite-que-avancou-sinal-e-bolsonaro-tenta-desconstruir-heroi-mandetta.shtml) (Saúde) adquiriu para grande parte da opinião pública na pandemia. O objetivo é criar condições políticas para demiti-lo.

 [Segundo a coluna Painel](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/04/mandetta-avisa-equipe-que-bolsonaro-procura-nome-para-substitui-lo-e-que-vai-ser-demitido.shtml), da **Folha**, Mandetta avisou sua equipe na noite desta terça-feira (14) que Bolsonaro já procura um nome para o seu lugar. O ministro conversou com integrantes da pasta em clima de [despedida](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/atitude-de-mandetta-de-confronto-com-bolsonaro-reduz-apoio-de-militares-a-ministro.shtml). De acordo com relatos, Mandetta avisou que combinou de esperar a escolha do substituto.

  Segundo a [coluna Mônica Bergamo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/04/equipe-de-mandetta-teme-demissao-por-twitter-e-ja-anuncia-debandada.shtml), da **Folha**, a equipe do ministro acredita que o presidente pode demiti-lo até pelo Twitter nas próximas horas.

 Um dos principais auxiliares de Mandetta, o secretário de vigilância em Saúde, [Wanderson Kleber de Oliveira](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/sao-paulo/2019/09/prioridade-sera-vacinar-contra-o-sarampo-crianca-de-ate-5-anos.shtml), enviou carta aos funcionários de sua área afirmando que ""a gestão de Mandetta acabou e preciso me preparar para sair junto"". Oliveira afirmou ainda que ""só Deus para entender o que querem fazer"".

 Mandetta afirmou a interlocutores que cometeu um erro ao dar a [entrevista ao Fantástico](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/brasileiro-nao-sabe-se-escuta-o-ministro-ou-o-presidente-diz-mandetta.shtml) no último domingo (12), com uma série de críticas indiretas ao presidente Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido), e reconheceu que, diante disso, seu cargo está novamente ameaçado.

 Depois de escapar na semana passada de uma [demissão que muitos consideravam certa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-avalia-demitir-mandetta-da-saude-sofre-pressao-e-ministro-diz-que-fica.shtml), o ministro foi avisado que sua saída do governo federal voltou a ser uma possibilidade nos próximos dias.

 Além da visível perda de sustentação entre os militares, que consideraram o tom da entrevista um ato de insubordinação, Bolsonaro levou em conta que até mesmo [alguns líderes do Congresso](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/04/e-hora-de-mais-trabalho-e-menos-entrevista-diz-lider-do-pp-em-critica-a-mandetta.shtml) criticaram o tom adotado na entrevista do ministro.

 A falta de fortes mobilizações nas [redes sociais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/em-embate-com-bolsonaro-mandetta-dispara-em-popularidade-digital-e-supera-lula-e-huck.shtml) em defesa do titular da Saúde também foi lida pelo presidente como uma brecha para efetuar a demissão.

 Na entrevista à TV Globo, domingo, Mandetta disse que a população não sabe se deve seguir as recomendações do Ministério da Saúde (favorável ao isolamento social) ou de Bolsonaro (crítico de medidas como o fechamento de comércios, por exemplo).

 O titular da Saúde também criticou quem rompe as regras de distanciamento para ir à padaria, numa crítica a Bolsonaro —o presidente foi na semana passada a um estabelecimento do tipo em Brasília e consumiu alimentos no balcão.

 Justamente essa insistência em [bater de frente com Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/mandetta-adota-posicao-de-enfrentamento-a-bolsonaro-desde-ameaca-de-demissao-relembre.shtml) custou a Mandetta o apoio da ala militar no Palácio do Planalto.

 A avaliação foi a de que o ministro desprezou o esforço do núcleo militar para que ele fosse mantido no cargo e está preocupado apenas com a sua imagem pública, em uma tentativa de se candidatar a governador de Mato Grosso do Sul em 2022 —Mandetta tem dados [seguidos sinais de enfrentamento ao presidente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/mandetta-adota-posicao-de-enfrentamento-a-bolsonaro-desde-ameaca-de-demissao-relembre.shtml) desde a ameaça de sua demissão na semana passada, sendo a entrevista o último deles.

 O descontentamento do grupo fardado ficou evidente nesta terça-feira (14) com uma declaração do vice-presidente, general Hamilton Mourão. Em entrevista ao jornal O Estado de S. Paulo, Mourão afirmou que o ministro da Saúde cometeu uma falta grave na fala à TV Globo.

 ""​Cruzou a linha da bola, não precisava ter dito determinadas coisas"", afirmou o vice. Mourão, no entanto, avaliou que o melhor seria o presidente não demitir o auxiliar neste momento.

 Durante a segunda-feira, Mandetta conversou com aliados. Justificou que decidiu dar a entrevista porque ficou irritado com o comportamento de Bolsonaro no sábado (11), durante uma visita a obras de um hospital de campanha em Águas Lindas de Goiás (GO).

 Na ocasião, o mandatário mais uma vez ignorou orientações das autoridades sanitárias e promoveu aglomerações —o titular da Saúde acompanhou a cena de longe.

 Os interlocutores que conversaram com o ministro na segunda disseram que ele reafirmou que não pedirá demissão, mas reconheceu que está numa situação de maior debilidade do que na semana passada.

 A relação entre Bolsonaro e Mandetta nunca foi próxima, sempre foi protocolar. O ministro foi indicado ao cargo pelo governador de Goiás, Ronaldo Caiado (DEM), aliado de primeira hora do presidente, mas hoje rompido com ele por divergências na conduta de combate ao coronavírus.

 Pela falta de afinidade com Mandetta, Bolsonaro chegou a cogitar a sua substituição em setembro do ano passado, mas desistiu ao constatar que ele tinha amplo apoio junto ao setor da saúde.

 No início da pandemia do coronavírus, o presidente se queixou ao ministro de que ele deveria defender mais o governo e o repreendeu por ter participado de uma entrevista ao lado do governador de São Paulo, João Doria (PSDB), adversário político de Bolsonaro.

 Mandetta modulou sua retórica e passou a pregar a importância de a atividade econômica não parar. Ele, no entanto, não se dobrou à pressão do presidente contra a medida de isolamento social, o que iniciou o embate entre ambos.​

 A crise com Mandetta abalou Bolsonaro. Segundo assessores presidenciais, pela primeira vez desde que assumiu o cargo, o presidente receou estar perdendo capital político ao constatar que parte da base bolsonarista nas redes sociais apoia o ministro. Nas últimas semanas, Bolsonaro [chegou a afirmar que falta humildade a Mandetta e que ele extrapolou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/esta-faltando-um-pouco-mais-de-humildade-ao-mandetta-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-ministro-da-saude.shtml).

 ### MANDETTA CONFRONTA PRESIDENTE APÓS O ‘FICO’

 **Enquadramento**  
 No dia 6 de abril, um dia depois de [ameaçar “usar a caneta”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-diz-que-usara-a-caneta-contra-integrantes-do-governo-que-viraram-estrelas.shtml) contra ministros que “viraram estrelas”, Bolsonaro foi questionado por Mandetta sobre o motivo pelo qual não o demitia. A pergunta surgiu em reunião de ministros; o presidente, segundo relatos, não respondeu. Ministros militares, em parte responsáveis por demover Bolsonaro da ideia de exonerar o titular da pasta da Saúde, tentaram contornar a situação. Mandetta também perguntou por que fora nomeado, já que o presidente não o ouvia

 **Recados em discurso**  
 Após um dia inteiro de indefinição, na mesma segunda-feira (6), Mandetta anunciou que ficaria na pasta e [mandou recados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/entenda-um-a-um-os-recados-de-mandetta-a-bolsonaro-no-anuncio-do-fico-no-governo.shtml) ao presidente. Defendeu insistentemente o respeito à ciência e citou o mito da caverna de Platão, uma alegoria sobre o conflito entre a ignorância e o conhecimento. Também apoiou as medidas dos governadores que se tornaram antagonistas do presidente na crise de saúde

 **Críticas ao presidente em Goiás**  
 No sábado (11), depois de Bolsonaro participar de aglomeração de apoiadores em Águas Lindas de Goiás, Mandetta, que também estava na cidade e observou a multidão à distância, [criticou o presidente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-visita-obra-de-hospital-provoca-novas-aglomeracoes-e-e-criticado-por-mandetta-e-caiado.shtml).

And this is where it gets murky.  Let's say we allow people to possess heroin. They can even use it. They can't allow it to harm others.  When does that harm occur? Only if someone else is exposed to the drug and is hurt?  

How about all the tax dollars being spent to equip ambulances and police officers with Narcan and the money spent having emergency services respond to those overdoses? The cost of treating them in the hospital? The increased costs passed on to health insurance companies and then me?  Which ""harms"" count?

As for explosives, I'm fine with people having them, but I don't want my neighbor keeping 2 tons of explosives in his garage as if it explodes then my house goes up to and potentially myself and members of my family are killed.  So sure, possess them, but it should be illegal to possess and store improperly.  Keep it in an industrial area or other ""safe"" area like regulations require today.  

Under your premise even building a bomb is legal, only exploding it to harm/kill is illegal.  While in many areas of law today it's not illegal to have something and the law can't intervene many times until some act is taken, I'm ok with SOME limits on possession.  

&gt; Today’s criminal lords wouldn’t have much clout tho if possession was no longer a crime.

If the only crime they did was drugs then maybe.  But even where drugs are legal there are still illegal sales.  Even where prostitution is legal there is illegal prostitution.  Gangs and criminals will always exist.  Maybe legalizing some drugs will reduce their influence but it won't eliminate them.

&gt; People MUST be allowed to choose for themselves.

And they should be accountable for those actions. The two concepts go together.

&gt; This means people will die. 

Problem is that many want to legalize the choice but not allow the people to die.  If Narcan was reserved for only accidental exposure (e.g. the medic/cop responding to a scene who inhales Fentenyl powder) then that would make people accountable and then I'd be more inclined to allow free choice.",-1

**Al resto del reddit**: Creo que debería ser importante hacer una distinción entre el investigador y el objeto de investigación. Entiendase, la encuesta sirve para recabar información respecto a un tema bastante especifico, lo cual no quiere decir que el investigador tenga una posición respecto al objeto de estudio. Es como hacer una encuesta respecto al consumo de drogas, preguntar que tan frecuentemente consumes heroina (o tus conocidos) no implica que el investigador este promoviendo el uso de la misma. 

Y en este caso en particular, creo que la investigación propuesta y los resultados pueden ser importantes, o por lo menos interesantes, ya que implicitamente la encuesta busca ver hasta que grado ha permeado el lenguaje inclusivo en el uso cotidiano. ¿Es que no leyeron bien las preguntas? 

""¿Qué tan frecuentemente OYES/DICES el lenguaje inclusivo para blablabla"".

No se ustedes, pero yo le puse frecuentemente en las primeras dos opciones (las opciones tradicionales con O y A, como en latino o latina) porque son las gramaticalmente correctas, e incluso entre los ""progres"" que apoyan esta tontería, lo normal es escucharlos diciendo ""amigos"" o ""compañeras"" y similares. ¿Por ventura de Dios, alguno de ustedes ha escuchado a alguien diciendo ""mexicanXs""? ¿Como se oye, como en los X-Men, /mejicancss/?

Otto Rank se baseia em inumeros antropologos e sociologos que estudaram a religiosidade de tribos e povos em diferentes partes do mundo como assim seus mitos. O livro mais famoso de Rank se chama ""O mito do nascimento do Heroi"" (The myth of the birth of the hero) onde ele apresenta mitologias de varios povos e aponta uma narrativa similar em todas elas, apesar de muitos desses povos nunca terem tido contatos.

O motivo dessas similaridades foi objeto de curiosidade e pesquisa a partir da segunda metade do seculo 19 entre antropologos e sociologos. Varias teorias surgiram mas Otto Rank, como psicanalista, observou que mitos, contos de fadas etc, sao criados por adultos mas baseado em sonhos infatis, que carregam similaridades idependente do povo e cultura. Algo inerente ao humano.

Muitos outros filosofos como Nietzche e Schopenhauer ja falavam do Will Power, mas Otto Rank observou a similaridade da questao do Will Power irenente ao humano com a crenca primitiva tambem inerente ao humano, da forca cosmica que no Oriente era chamado de Mana mas todos povos acreditavam. E que eh o que conceituamos hoje como Will Power e a questao humana psicologica em volta disso.

Os mitos em geral todos trazem essa mesma narrativa do will power, do super-homem e do resultado da morte criado por ela. Que tambem ha nas narrativas biblicas e mais recente historicamente como Hamlet, Don Juan, entre outros. Historias que surgem da introspeccao e que resulta nem similaridades inerete a questao da preservacao e auto perpetuacao da vida.

Astharaan, the homeland of the elves, encompasses a rocky archipelago that   a vast archipelago of the same name, with four main islands (Thera, Anpha, Oròe and Essèa) compromising most of the country’s domains.

The realm was founded when Cirtha, the legendary elven heroine, unified the five warring city-states of the elves under her reign. Fifty-five years later, the queen sailed west in a quest to discover the cure of morphea, a mysterious and deadly illness that afflicted the islands population. Before her departure, Cirtha chose a council of five seneschals - the Pentarchy - to rule in her stead. As Cirtha never returned from her journey, Astharaan was governed by the pentarchs until its last days.

The most important cities of Astharaan, called the Five Cities, were Aldara (in the isle of Anpha), Daone (in the isle of Essèa), Londorel, Melara (in the isle of Oròe) and Theane (in the isle of Thera) and .

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Which could be the problem. I can't sleep on it either, and when i notice I'm getting random head rushes, I know ts time to stop for a while. But when I do it, I swallow like a 32nd to a 16th of a gram and stray high for 10 to 20 hours, depending on how good it is. It doesn't really do this to me, but I have heard of severe paranoia and mild hallucinations, which you described. I have seen people in the distance only to get closer and realize it wasn't a person, but I am older and my eyes aren't what they used to be  It also  sounds like yours might have been cut with something funky. Fetanyl maybe? I am not familiar enough with fetty to know. Every one has different reactions to meth too. I have a friend that is awake for three days every time he does it (he doesn't do it anymore) and for the last day and a half of those three days he is a mess. Can not think clearly, can not focus on anything, can not complete simple tasks, his train of thought is about 2 seconds long for each thought. He can barely form a sentence. it's ugly, it does not do that to me. It helps me concentrate and complete mundane boring tasks with a good attitude.

You are assuming those block to block gangs aren't affected by high end weed sales, but you agree and the DEA agree that more and  more weed is coming from *high end* west coast providers.

In other words, there is a market that the street vendors were profiting from, which they no longer will be since they now have legalized competition.

As a result those block to block gangs are going to get more territorial in not just weed sales, but in other drug trafficking because now they need to make up for lost marijuana sales by pushing harder drugs, or cutting them with fetanyl, which they have already started to do.

Individuals in this unit have been selected on a random basis for drug testing.  There is no probable cause or reasonable suspicion that anyone in the unit is using or abusing drugs or a controlled substance. 

Everyone selected will be tested.  Anyone not present will be rescheduled for testing at a later date. 

Every specimen collected will be tested for Marijuana (THC); Cocaine; Amphetamines (which include methamphetamines, MDMA (ecstasy), and MDA), heroin, opiates (which include, morphine and codeine), synthetic opioids (Oxycodone/ oxymorphone) known commonly as OxyCotin and Hydrocodone/hydromorphone) and Fentanyl, selected benzodiazepines and synthetic cannabinoids, known commonly as Spice. 

Testing procedures outlined in AR 600-85 will be followed. All Soldiers must be aware that all verbal orders connected with the testing are lawful and are to be followed as such. 

A refusal to comply with orders relating to this test subjects the Soldier to punitive or administrative actions under AR 600-85, AR 135-18, AR 135-178, and AR 635-10. 

Does anyone have any questions?

That’s such a literalist thing to say. I suppose you take all of the Bible literally then? So is Jesus a literal vine then and a literal door? 

“Jesus said be prepared many times in Matthew 24” 

Yeah, he was speaking to a first century audience and that should be obvious. Verses 16-20 clearly depict instructions for a first century people and not a modern 21st century people. 

(16) ""then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. (17) Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, (18) and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. (19) And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! (20) Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.""

These verses directly speak to a first century audience, the first evidence being the instruction in verse 17 to those who dwell on the housetops in Jerusalem. This was a common practice of the Jews (Dt. 22:8) but is no longer. The reason the there is a woe given to pregnant women in verse 19 is because traveling while pregnant was extremely difficult in those days as they rode on horseback whereas today it’s but a minor inconvenience. As for verse 20, there were strict travel rules on the Sabbath in the first century, and the Jews obeyed them even in the midst of war or conflict (Antiq. 13.8.4); however, today there are very few Jews who observe any travel restrictions on the Sabbath. And finally Jesus instructs them to also pray that their flight isn’t in the winter, because the winter kept even the most formidable of armies from advancing during the generation of the disciples (Wars 1.17.6; 4.8.1; 4.10.2), but only a severe storm would disrupt a modern transportation and not the season in general to which Christ refers.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

353,2020-04-10 13:05:31+00:00,"yeah about 700 dollars. You can use sulfuric acid aswell for the acidifying. The only thing i wonder is how to seperate the platinum black from the hydromorphone at the end.Okay and you really need a reflux,otherwise you would need to constantly add water again and also sulfuric acid,to keep the ph the same,which also costs money. Maybe its possible to filter off the platinum with a coffee filter at the end and then boil the solution till theres only powder hydromorphone left. If you get it right you can constantly double your amount of opioids. I personally get 1100 mg of morphine a day,which i could convert to 550 mg of hydromorphone,which snorted has about 50% bioavailabillity compared to the 30% oral.I have avout 20 grams of morphine stocked. Im also thinking about making heroin myself,but the heroin base to heroin hcl conversion i dont know how to perform.

I dont know how much hcl i need and also the recipe i found calls for unholy amounts of diethyl ether and ethylalcohol for the hcl conversion aswell( half a liter  each per 100 grams).Too much hcl and you destroy the diamorphine molecule,too less and you dont convert it completely. Also how am i supposed to get the heroi  hcl out of solution because in the concentrated hcl is still water in it,which the heroin will be dissolved in.

The problem with the hydromorphone synth is that you can only do 5 gram at a time if you dont have money to buy like 100 grams of platina black for 10.000$",1

357,2020-04-10 07:16:53+00:00,"I just came across a synth yesterday that makes it sooo damn easy to convert morpine to hydromophone. It makes sense though, because they both have identical chemical formulas, and hydromorphone is just an isomer of morphine -- with the configuration of the molecule flipped in reverse. Here's the synth below, which I'd absolutely *love* to try, but the only unfortunate thing is u need a catalyst of platinum, which just so happens to be a precious metal about as valuable as gold. After a little searching, it looks like 5g of platina black would set u back over $2,000! But the only good thing is catalysts aren't actually consumed in chemical reactions -- they just enable it to happen -- so u should technically be able to save and reuse all the platinum over and over again. I'm not sure how difficult or feasible it'd be though. Anyway here's the synth. They report a 50% yield, but on the page it looks like someone they actually got more 
like 60% (3g hydromorphone after starting with 5g morphine). I don't think u actually lose any of the morphine, but I'd guess the other 40-50% just stays unreacted as regular morphine.  I think it's awesome though because since ur starting with morphine hcl, u end with hydromorphone hcl, which is already all set for use hahah..

Сасвим је могуће да је тај број ближи десет у Србији, због веће употребе алкохола, а мање употребе осталих дрога у односу на друге државе. Иначе специфично за Србију можеш наћи само податке о предозирању илегалним дрогама, а они ти не дају пуну слику.

Тема поста су свакако психоделици тј. халуциногени. Амфетамин је класичан стимулант.

&gt;treba da te podsetim koliko nam dece umire od spida ?

Подсети ме? Понављам тема се зове психоделици, спид није психоделик, а број људи који умре од амфетамина у Србији је магнитудама пута мањи него број људи који умре од алкохола или дувана.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

387,2020-04-07 23:00:37+00:00," Depois de obrigar um [dos mais poderosos navios do mundo a sair de combate](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/04/coronavirus-obriga-evacuacao-de-porta-avioes-americano-no-pacifico.shtml), o novo coronavírus agora derrubou nesta terça-feira (7) o chefe da Marinha dos Estados Unidos, Thomas Modly.

 Ele não ficou doente, mas sim comandou um desastre de relações públicas envolvendo um surto do [patógeno causador da Covid-19](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/30/5899-acompanhe-todas-as-informacoes-sobre-a-pandemia-de-coronavirus.shtml) no USS Theodore Roosevelt, 1 dos 11 porta-aviões de propulsão nuclear que garantem a Washington a primazia sobre os mares.

 O surto começou a ser detectado [na semana retrasada.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/04/coronavirus-obriga-evacuacao-de-porta-avioes-americano-no-pacifico.shtml) Na segunda da semana passada (30), o capitão do navio, Brett Crozier, mandou quatro páginas de mensagem por e-mail para Modly, dizendo que a situação era insustentável por ser impossível obrigar isolamento social numa embarcação com 4.800 marinheiros e marinheiras.

 Modly seguiu impassível, e no dia seguinte a mensagem do capitão foi publicada pelo jornal The San Francisco Chronicler. Não ficou provado, mas é presumível que ele mesmo a tenha vazado, direta ou indiretamente. Com a publicidade, a história correu o mundo e fez com que a Marinha iniciasse o desembarque do USS Theodore Roosevelt no dia seguinte.

 Só que na quinta (2), Modly resolveu dispensar Crozier do seu comando. O capitão desceu à terra em Guam, [território americano no Pacífico onde o navio está atracado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2017/11/1932571-em-exercicio-militar-bombardeiros-dos-eua-sobrevoam-peninsula-coreana.shtml), com o nome sendo gritado por toda a tripulação ainda no convés.

  Nesta segunda (6), a cereja do bolo: Modly falou, por meio do sistema do barco, para os cerca de mil marinheiros que ficaram para manter o navio operacional —seus dois reatores nucleares não podem ficar sem manutenção.

 Na fala, ele chamou Crozier de ""ou muito ingênuo, ou muito estúpido"" por ter permitido o vazamento de sua carta. Segundo relatos que chegaram à imprensa americana, os militares a bordo ficaram horrorizados com os termos usados contra alguém que consideram um heroi.

 Modly sentiu o cheiro de queimado e divulgou uma nota se retratando, segundo a rede CNN por ordens do secretário de Defesa, Mark Esper. ""Eu peço desculpas por qualquer confusão que essa escolha de palavras tenha causado"", disse, afirmando que quis dizer o contrário do que disse.

 Não colou, e o caso virou um escândalo nacional. Membros de comitês de defesa do Congresso pediram a cabeça de Modly, que entregou sua renúncia na tarde desta terça. Ele será substituído pelo subsecretário do Exército, James McPherson, que havia sido confirmado no cargo pelo Senado havia 15 dias.

 Modly, por sua vez, ainda não havia sido confirmado. Ele já estava havia cinco meses à frente da Marinha, e apresentou um plano audacioso de construção naval para [fazer frente ao crescente poderio da China nesta área.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/12/novos-porta-avioes-evidenciam-que-batalha-naval-ainda-importa-a-potencias.shtml) O número de navios principais de combate subiria, de acordo com o plano, de 121 para 355.

 O USS Theodore Roosevelt segue em Guam. O último porto em que esteve antes do surto foi o de Da Nang, na costa vietnamita, antiga base americana durante a guerra no país asiático. Presume-se que foi lá que o patógeno embarcou no porta-aviões, que transporta até 90 aviões e helicópteros.

 Até aqui, 230 de seus tripulantes testaram positivo para a Covid-19 e estão em observação. O restante da tripulação está em hotéis, sob quarentena de 14 dias. Sem a intervenção do capitão Crozier, o número poderia ser bem maior.",1

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

I would pop two or three of them and hardly feel anything. However,  that isn't to say that you would end up like me..everyone is different. 

There are different types of extended release formulations. Some have the extended release matrix built into the pill itself so cutting,  crushing (if you even can) or shaving it into a powder doesn't break the mechanism because the time release mechanism surrounds the active ingredient and your body has to bust through that to get to it. Some is released right away, usually, but not the entire thing. Then there are others, and its been a while so I could be mistaken, like the purple extended release morphines I used to get, that I could just peel the outer coating off of and chew.. to break the time relase.

416,2020-04-06 02:29:02+00:00,"Yea. If I ever had a bunch of morphine, I'd absolutely wanna acetylate that though. Not even for diacetylmorphine with acetic anhydride though, because I'd actually rather just use glacial acetic acid to selectively acetylate and make 6-MAM, which is said to be about 30% more potent than diacetylmorhpine itself. 

After reading up on 6-MAM it makes me wonder why more producers aren't making that specifically, but then again it's the primary constituent of black tar. It has the edge in potency over dope though, because when dope quickly gets deacetylated in the body, there's some 3-MAM produced which hardly has any psychoactive effects, and that doesn't become active until it's fully deacetylated back into morphine. 

But when u specifically create 6-MAM, there's no 3-MAM involved at all, and 6-MAM is actually the ""good part"" of dope, and what's responsible for the rush, after all. The only reason why it's ""selectively"" produced with GAA, is because GAA isn't a strong enough acetylating agent to work on the 3-position of mophine, so it can only work at the 6-position, but that's the important part!",1

I was operated on said jaw, to try and make it look normal. When you get a jaw operation it hurts like a motherfucker. You can barely open your mouth and your whole face is swollen and bruised. Basically i was miserable, knowing how terrible i looked and how strong the pain was and that i had to eat slop for 5 weeks.

My mother had demanded that the nurses give me oxycodon because their ibuprofen wasn't strong enough for the pain was experiencing. 

I took it, and sometime later i was high and happy, my mother leaned in to kiss my head and my sister snapped a photo. 

She argues that i had known she was taking and didnt object it but i dont even remember her taking it at all cause i was so high.

Why would i let anyone take a picture of me in that state? I wore a scarf over my face for 4 weeks when i was in public because i was so embarrassed of my looks.

So today i wake up and she shows me she had printed out pictures to hang up. One of those pictures is the one she took in the hospital. I tell her to throw it out because she had no right doing that and she acts as if im selfish.

Most people on immunosuppressants still have pretty much a fully functional immune system.

The munchies that are on immunosuppressants, like methotrexate, take the whole ""immunocompromised"" label to an extreme, when in reality their immune systems probably really arent much weaker than a normal persons.

Its addiction level is actually very low for its potency.  The problem is, people head ""low"" and took it as ""none.""  And again, for its potency level.  Oxy is extremely powerful.  Not as powerful as heroin/diamorphine, but far moreso than normal morphine.  30mg of MScontin (morphine sulfate, standard vanilla oral morphine in a time release form) barely dulls the edge of my pain.  30mg of oxycontin eliminates my pain unless I'm having a really bad day.  So very low addictiveness for its potency is still pretty goddamn addictive overall.

(In case anyone is wondering why morphine is so meh when pop culture treats morphine as the be all and end all of painkillers, it's because we're discussing oral morphine.  IV morphine is the pop culture icon.  Opiates taken orally have are only about 10% of the potency of the exact same stuff being taken by IV.  That's why heroin addicts inject their stuff while chronic pain patients like myself take pills.  They need to get all the bang for their mg they can, as euphoric doses are magnitudes above analgesic doses.)",1

“This safe supply stuff is great. Word on the street - users want - pharmaceutical grade Fent (Fentenyl), black tar heroin, China white and Afghan brown...

Stimulate users want - Colombian Cocaine, clean speed and uncontaminated freebase crack cocaine...

What about a safe supply of pharmaceutical grade Ketamine?

We need more options... 
The City of Vancouver has taken a huge step in the right direction... (sad it was COVID19 that made it happen) - but 95% of opiate users on the DTES agree - just saying it like it is... Nobody really wants Hydromorphs/Dillys - Give the people what they really want. 

I feel like only real drug users understand - The addiction isn’t just the dope... it’s also the ritual, getting the dope, picking up the gear (needles or foil), cooking it up (I used to sing love songs and lullabies to my dope as it cooked), I used to love slowly sticking the needle into my arm and flagging it... pills are also more likely to cause endocarditis....

Funny, they talk about substituting one addiction for another, but do you ever notice how quickly Christie jumps into sex??  Not relationships, just casual sex.  And she is showing how having sex with people without any real emotion or commitment can be more trouble than drinking or gambling!  Because then you have to break off the relationship, and now these people know more about you because you are more vunerable and they take advantage of your emotions.  Hell, sex is a drug - it causes you to release oxycotin.  It makes you feel good!  

The stereotype is that men have done it for years, but it really does look bad and makes you wonder about your health and reputation when women do it. I think it shows she needs more self assurance, and sex is a safe outlet.  Remember when she was dating and having sex with her ex husband's wife's father?  That was soooo twisted.

If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.",1

464,2020-04-02 23:33:51+00:00,"and your tone is acting as if having and raising a child is some horrible burden rather than, based on surveys of old people who have and havent had children, one of the best things you can experience and do in your life. then you double down and say how dangerous and uncertain it is. it's not any of those things. if you fill out the correct paperwork, having a baby as a single mother lets you live 18 years essentially in retirement. if you can manage to earn ~$8000 per year doing easy, part-time work then you'll get literally more spending power than the ""working poor"" since you receive subsidized or eliminated rent, utilities, food, and education and then a fat EITC and ACTC tax refund on top of your welfare payments. literally all you have to do is not kill the child and your life is easier than most people's. like, the choice is ""work 40+ hours per week, have no money, treat dog/cat like a child"" or ""work &lt;10 hours per week, spend all day with a child your body's hormones are designed to feel amazing about (you're basically high on oxycotin the entire time you're feeding), and get disposable spending money on top of it all. AND be praised by the community for how much sacrifice and struggle you're enduring"". oh yeah, and also you can fuck the father for child support for 18 years, too. gee which one is more of a burden on you?

like, from a rational point of view, if a single woman has an abortion and then goes back to working a minimum wage job, she's probably making a bad financial decision unless she's in the top 10% of wage earners. and from what i've seen in my career (finance), rich old unmarried women are bitter and unhappy wine aunts across the board whereas the mothers and grandmothers eat that shit up .",1

I for one have a much older sibling that is doing heroine and fentinyl, (just as long as I have), the damage and turmoil that he causes is unspeakable towards those who haven't witnessed it. And my parents cannot detach themselves from him, they can't, you have to understand that! They won't give up, which is a 50/50 bargain if they do, he could come back begging for help(which might take years, although you'll see him often) otherwise it'll never happen which is frightening.i thought, being the younger brother he'll have something to open his eyes wider. But if they cannot admit that they have a problem they are not yet ready to change. (That lock up time period is supposed to be there for him when he has come out of rehab because you have to turn from your playground,playmates and play toys!) Until you strong enough. And go for meetings! While he's in lock up at home! 
You do have the right to detach yourself though, that should build a feeling of disgust within himself and soon might open an eye!

We were walking down the street and he lit up a blunt smoked some and passed it to me, i smoked a little bit and started feeling hazy and was like is there something in this weed and he was like yeah dust. I had already smoked like ten hits and really liked how i felt so i finshed the blunt with him. I blackout and next thing i rember is being in an area close by to where we were and this girl slid my wallet out my back pocket, i could feel it, and man was i dusted it felt like i was in a tunnel in a good was everything sounded cool like the cars passing and i couldnt feel my body and walking felt like i was on the moon. I was like bitch give me back my wallet. She looked in it saw there was no money in it and gave it back. (She probely saw me walking down the streer fucked up , and saw a chance to get some money) n e ways shes walks away. Im with my friend btw shes dusted too.

So i take the bus home a few hours later ounce i get home im still high, after about 6 hours of being high and thinking wtf how am i still high, i was expecting it to ware off by then. I start hearing voices of people arguing and it sounds like its coming from next door. But i know the ppl next door and it didnt sound like there voices, this goes on a little while and im started to freakout a bit. Its finally stops. I watch tv for 2 3 hours and then go to sleep. I wake up im fine. 

Thats my first exp with it. I never intended to even smoke it.

About a month later i with someone and he tells tht he sells dust his name is wiz. So i debate it a bit but buy some off him and decide to try it again.

I take it home with me and roll a blunt fill of dust no weed. And smoke it carfully, kinda experment with it. 3 hits die it out she how it feels. And it felt really relaxing, good, eqrophic, etc... hard to explain. If i had to explain with other drugs this would be the closest.

I know this because i also use all drugs

Ive acutally used every drug besides, mushrooms, ketimene, and crystal meth, well i did take some meth bomb e pills ounce. But never smoked acutal ice.

And all the pills you can get high on, and even things you wouldnt normally include in a drug list like, dust off, nitrous oxide, kratoom, kava, nutmeg, basically anything you can abuse to get high ive done.

And also drugs thar arnt narcotics, like seroquil, busibar, koliden, gamma pention, aterax, and a whole bunch more i cant think of.

Believe it milk and salt up your noise counter acts pcp.

So one time i was smoking alot of dust, this wus a yr later, with my friends and my arms lock up and i fall back and cant move. My fruends get me water and milk and help me drink it and after about 30 mins im fine, never lost consious

And then on 2 occasions i od on dust and lose connisous and wake up in the hospital. Both times im totally fine, one time my mom found me, the other time my dad found me, and said i was unreapance and called an ambulance. At the hospital they cant do anything for you besides give you some adivan and wait for the dust to wear off. Ovisaly if you become physcitic or violent they will give you haldol. Thats never happend to me.

Might i add that i never, ripped all my cloths off and ran down the street, or become violent, or do anything crazy. It dosent effect me like that. If it did i wouldnt do it 

For me i love the fact tht its a strong stimulat. You can stay up all night on it. And then the trippy effects it gives you is the perfect combo, atleast for me and like i said ive tried every drug so im not biasis. Also i met a guy who had only ever smoked dust, never did anything elus not even weed, this was in the projects, he started smoking dust when he was 13 and never stopped when i met me he was 27 and talking to him he seamed totally normal. Ovisily we smoked dust togeather

So yeah. Nd my best experice was one time i was at my friends house and his mom was gonna pay us to get rid of some sticks in the yard. Ovisaily we got dusted first, and being the the back yard throwing sticks and messing around was the most fun i ever had. Throwing a stick sound like, shoooommmmm sssshhhhhoooouhuhhuuuuuiiiummm..... it was so cool. Dust (for me) again diff 4 everone. Makes things sound really cool. Also ill add this last, after smoking dust for a while and being a daily dust user, oh yes and everything feels like slow mo, i started seeing coulors that didnt exist, you cant describle the feeling when you look at a stoplight and the coulors look so amazing like a thousand specs of diffrent coulors im never seen before, some alien shit, and dont get me started on how i could literally watch myself like a 3rd person video game, really no joke i could see myself walking around.

Yupp this is why i love dust, i smoked straight for 3 yrs, i also did herion, cocaine, adderal, (benzos daily) koldipin kpins, xanax, and ambien, diludid suboxen, molly, excasity, oxycotin ,,,,and ovisily then any opiate like percs or viks, drant cough syrup regually and dropped acid,,,, so i advently ended up going to rehab, i was in and out for a while because i didnt want to be clean, finally got sober for two yrs and was luke fuck this, started smoking weed, stop smoking weed, did molly on occasion, did coke on occasion, now i just smoke dust occisonaly, i havent smoked in a month when i write this post, and i just get a dub and mix it with a fair ammount of tabbcco to diaulite it, and smoke those occusionally just to get the feeling, im currently not addicted to any drugs, and yes i use to shoot up herion, diludid, morphine, cocaine, and molly",1

Zato sto su ljudi u proseku robovi navika i ne razmisljaju preterano racionalno. Javni prevoz je samo jedan nacin kretanja, penzioneri se setaju i druze na lokalu. Jedni kod drugih idu na kafu i igraju sah u obliznjem parku, ili ispred zgrade. To su i bile slike sa ulica kada se racunalo samo na postovanje preporuka.

&gt; A do nedavno otvoreni kafici i restorani, a dan danas i kladionice. To je kao da skidas narkomana sa heroina, reces mu budi dobar i nemoj izlazit iz sobe, a u hodniku mu ostavis pola kile žutog sve sa priborom. LOL

Oh shit, drzavni funkcioneri nesto uradili pogresno, da li zato sto su hteli da paze na rejting, ili su bili zauzeti drzanjem prsta u dupetu, sunce ti jebem koja novost... Ne znam po kom osnovu su kladionice bile izuzete od zabrane, ali zabrana rada kafica je uvedena kada se primetilo da ljudi ne postuju preporuke. 

&gt; Pa onda predjite na imunitet krda ko Svedska

Nema nikakvih posebnih naznaka da je to preterano bolja strategija. U oba scenarija se savetuje distanciranje. A takodje, razvoj imuniteta krda bi podrazumevao pustanje najzdravije populacije da se zarazi, sigurno ne bismo razvili imunitet krda sa crknutim penzosima. Sa sranjem u zdravstvu koje imamo, mislim da ovde ta strategija ne bi funkcionisala bas najbolje.

&gt; Izumiranjem mladje i radno aktivnog stanovnistva izumire i drzava te sustav. Uostalom zar vecina staraca ne zivi sa mladima i u obiteljima, dzaba im onda sta ne izlaze ih kuce kad ovi mladji sa kojima zive mogu cirkulirat okolo i donosit zarazu doma odnosno kako ti kazes prebacit teret na sebe

Koje crno izumiranje? Velika vecina zdravih i radno sposobnih ce preziveti oboljenje. Zdravstveni sistem mora da bude slobodan da prihvati obolele u toj populaciji. Sto se tice domacinstava gde starci zive sa svojim porodicama, obicno  imaju svoju sobu i porodica moze koliko toliko da im se sklanja s puta kad moraju da je napuste.

Zar nema efekt ovako kad umiru ovi mladji, drzavni sekretari i episkopi.

&gt;za one sa manje mozga je uveden policijski cas i zabrane okupljanja, pa samo ljudi sa radnim nalozima mogu da se krecu u to vreme.

&gt;Mladi i radno sposobni generalno imaju vise sanse da prezive ukoliko se razbole

Pa onda predjite na imunitet krda ko Svedska

&gt;Osim toga, sta ima novo u tome da se teret bilo kakvog sranja u drzavi prebacuje na mladje i sposobnije? 

Izumiranjem mladje i radno aktivnog stanovnistva izumire i drzava te sustav. Uostalom zar vecina staraca ne zivi sa mladima i u familijama, dzaba im onda sta ne izlaze iz kuce kad ovi mladji sa kojima zive mogu cirkulirat okolo i donosit zarazu doma odnosno kako ti kazes prebacit teret na sebe

&gt;Mi mladji i sposobniji uplacujemo u penzioni fond, jebavamo se sa skrtim poslodavcima i sl. Na mladjima svet ostaje, cak i kao teret.

To svuda mladi rade. Uostalom uzmi za primjer Hrvatsku sa slicnim narodima i zdravstvom.
