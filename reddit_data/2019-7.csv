10,2019-07-31 07:44:25+00:00,"My dad died of tramatic brain injury after colliding with a minivan turning in an intersection...neither bike nor van were going that fast.  Both bike and van were in the wrong.  My cousin was also in a coma for a few days after falling from her bike onto the sidewalk while attempting to go no handed.

So I always wear a helmet.  Freak accident for my dad after decades of riding.

But I just had a bike accident too.

As a guy who just broke his collar bone, shoulder blade, ribs, and ruined my helmet and only slightly damaged handlebar tape...my only complaint is the helmet didn't protect the rest of my upper body.  

We need collarbone /shoulder helmets too. 

Depending on your weight and speed, a severe bike accident can be as simple as an unseen rabbit running in front of you, and the amount of energy your body absorbs quickly can do a lot of damage depending on how you land.  In my case my head hit the edge of the asphalt path while my shoulder planted in the hard dirt just off the path.  16 mph to 0 right quick.  

Cost so far:  $20 handlebar tap, $80 helmet, $30 underarmor shirt, $25 gloves, $2200++ ambulance/fentanal charge, $14,000++ trama care (with desensitized nurses who like to torment those with broken ribs), lots of follow up xrays and CT scans, and I still may need surgery even more tramatic to by body than the original accident and who knows how much that will cost.

And I know how to fall, can ride wheelies, still can ride a unicycle with overinflated tire, and skateboard. I used to ride bmx without a helmet for years as a child/teenage, commuted on road bike as 15-16 year old from crystal to dinkytown (no helmet), crashed many times jumping BMX with only minor road rash, took big air jumps, etc.  I even had a motorcycle crash at 17 on highway 100 and I did not hit my head (but I was wearing a helmet as it was law).  I was in wrestling, could run and dive over fences as a kid, and I thought I knew how roll out of a fall to prevent collarbone fractures.

Well, I thought I knew how to roll out of a fall.  But this accident came out of nowhere on a slight downhill bike path that was not very heavily used, on a beautiful day with my heartrate at a very reasonable 140 bpm (I routinely push it to 160-170 bpm). 

At least I don't have tramatic brain injury but judging by the helmet, I would have liklely cracked my skull.

I estimate 2800 joules of energy were disappated very quickly (.1 seconds?) in my helmet, shoulder, dirt, and tar path edge.  My shoulder dug in when I landed, which probably saved some road rash but cost many fractures.  My bike is practically unscathed.

In comparison, a .45 bullet has about 1600 joules of energy when fired.

E=1/2 *mass*velocity^2.

So let's say you weigh 190 lbs, or 86 kg, and you fall unexpectedly headfirst into an immovable object, say a curb, lamppost, or similar.  How fast do you need to be going to disappate the same amount of energy as if you were shot by a 0.45?  Answer:  13.6 mph.  

I weigh 109 kg. and was doing about 16 mph.  For comparison, some of the rural hills I take I can reach speeds of 40 mph easily.  With those specs we are talking over 17000 joules, as that v^2 term above has a big impact on energy.

I have also foolishly done 30 mph down gravel hills, so fast you have little steering control, which is thrilling but in hindsight not smart

P.S.  Once my fractures heal, I am thinking of switching from a roadbikeish gravel bike to a fat bike, for increased drag and slower speeds, since I mostly bike for summer time calorie burn, and I have a family to support...cannot die yet, and the only exercise I enjoy is riding a bike.",1

32,2019-07-29 16:58:04+00:00,"One thing I noticed a long time ago while browsing TheFirearmBlog which occasionally has collections of pictures of seized homemade guns, usually from South Africa, Brazil, and Australia, is that the homebrew firearms in areas with almost complete gun control were almost always compact shotguns or SMGs.

&amp;#x200B;

There appear to be three main reasons for this:

The biggest reason is that these are often the simplest arms to produce. Our semi-automatic rifles are actually pretty complex, more complex than a smaller full-auto-only gun, the higher-pressure rifle cartridges need more exact materials and machining tolerances to be safe in the gun, the higher pressures also require ways of delaying or slowing the action while pressures drop, and restricting fire to semi-auto usually requires extra parts in the trigger called a disconnector. On the other hand, the open-bolt direct-blowback SMG is the first fully-automatic weapon to be widely issued to basic infantry for a reason. It has the fewest parts of any automatic, timing is much easier than a higher pressure gun, can be made with cheap or poor quality materials without beating itself apart, and could be made on basic machine tools as early as 1915. While most troops were still using bolt-actions in 1945 in WWII, SMGs were starting to see mass production and adoption as early as 1920 after the world saw the MP18 in WWI in large part due to their simplicity in design and manufacture. SMGs are also generally more controllable, simpler to maintain, and easier to train conscripts on, and extremely effective in urban combat where their disadvantage in range matters least.

&amp;#x200B;

Ammo availability appears to play a part but I don't know enough on the ammo controls in these countries to take that apart.

&amp;#x200B;

The other is the Iron Law of Prohibition: the government is trying to ban something to ""keep people safe"" but smugglers are incentivized to try to try to make the product smaller to be easier to smuggle, but also more potent to be able to satisfy the customer with a smaller product once smuggled. Examples of this are bootleggers carrying mostly spirits rather than beer during the prohibition and modern drug runners bringing in fentenyl during the current opioid crisis.

Related to guns, this means someone trying to smuggle, create for sale to gangsters or smugglers, or to illegally carry a firearm will want to produce or procure the most firepower in the smallest footprint: a submachine gun, or a ""sawn-off"" shotgun. So while a citizen who can legally get his hands on a larger, less concealable and slower firing gun will settle for the larger gun even if he wants something more compact; the criminal is incentivized to go the complete other way. In the US, a criminal will usually settle for the same weapons available to and stolen from the populace rather than figuring out his own supply , even if they are less advantageous to him in terms of firepower, ease of untrained use, and compactness. In countries with complete gun control, the Iron Law of Prohibition seems to rule and the weapons most favored by black market manufacturers are those the urban politicians are usually most fearing in the hands of gangsters and other potential urban fighters: the SMG and short barreled shotgun.",1

34,2019-07-29 13:11:26+00:00,"Have you looked into having a DNA test done to determine what medications work best for you? I had one done 5 years ago, I have full body Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, and none of the pain meds my docs were giving me were working. I'd get relief for 20-30 min and then I'd be at max pain levels all over again. I was on HEAVY pain meds, fentanyl and oxycotin for one, but still in agony. 

I'd heard in one of my support groups that your doctor can test your DNA and see what medications will work for you. I asked my doctor to give me the test and she happily agreed. When we got the results back, it turned out that I hyper metabolize a lot of the more commonly prescribed pain medications. After a tweaking my meds a bit, I had relief I hadn't felt since pre CRPS.

Tampouco apreciava frango frito de fast food. [Joaquim Nabuco](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/angela-alonso/2017/11/1936240-deslize-de-william-waack-mostra-lado-do-escravismo-que-persiste-ate-hoje.shtml) preferiria a “slow food”. E não só por sua veia gourmet, hábil em distinguir temperos e taninos, mas por atinar com o espírito da atividade diplomática.

 O ofício exige dialogar com gente bem preparada, atrair simpatias e neutralizar contrários. Tudo via argumentação —terreno no qual Eduardo é noviço—, já que a diplomacia é o avesso da guerra —a que pai e filhos [se dedicam diuturnamente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/angela-alonso/2019/05/e-dificil-definir-tanto-o-comeco-quanto-o-fim-de-uma-democracia.shtml). É trunfo dominar a arte da conversação, no que ajuda carisma e erudição, domínio de idiomas e etiquetas nem se fala.

 Ao revés do 03, Nabuco atendia à abundância os requisitos quando inaugurou nossa embaixada entre os ianques.

 Foi em 1905. O Brasil tinha lá ministro plenipotenciário, posição um degrau abaixo de embaixador, mas a mudança aprofundava relações com o país que era à época o equivalente à China de hoje (a maior potência era a Inglaterra): manancial de oportunidades de influência e negócios. Para aproveitá-las, o embaixador precisava, como agora, de mais credenciais que o nome de família.

 Nabuco as tinha: membro destacado da política nacional, liderara um bloco parlamentar por reformas, tinha trânsito entre elites cultural e econômica e farta rede de contatos internacionais. Escrevera na imprensa, publicara livros que se tornaram clássicos e fundara a Academia Brasileira de Letras [com Machado de Assis](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/angela-alonso/2019/06/so-nao-viram-deslizes-do-heroi-moro-os-cegos-de-odio-pelo-vilao.shtml) —suas amizades não incluíam nenhum Queiroz.

 Em contraste com a inexperiência de Eduardo, Joaquim servira como adido nos Estados Unidos e ocupava o primeiro posto brasileiro na Inglaterra. Tinha 56 anos, velhice naquele tempo. O 03 tem 35, limite da juventude neste século, por isso a legislação manda transpô-lo antes de ocupar cargo tão relevante. Faltam a Eduardo não apenas as primaveras e o bigode, mas os atributos intelectuais de Nabuco.

 Carece também do desprendimento para representar o país, em vez de vocalizar a facção olavocarvalhista do bolsonarismo. Pode-se argumentar que, como todos têm partido, melhor escancará-lo, no que a família presidencial é hors concours.

 Contudo, os bons representantes no estrangeiro —e em terra pátria— são os que, como Nabuco, têm a grandeza de colocar o interesse nacional acima de relações pessoais e partidárias. São esses os que [figuram como estadistas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/angela-alonso/2019/02/ja-da-para-ver-que-jair-bolsonaro-e-um-antiestadista.shtml) nos livros escolares —ao menos enquanto o ministro da Educação não os reescrever. 

 Nabuco foi um embaixador exemplar, firmou acordos de cooperação econômica e política, difundiu a cultura nacional e logrou influência significativa. Graças a sua habilidade de tecer relações e a sua ascendência junto ao secretário de Estado e ao presidente norte-americanos, compôs o grupo de formuladores do que viria a ser a Organização dos Estados Americanos. Logrou-o por suas competências, não por portar genes presidenciais.

 Mas Joaquim Nabuco só pôde ser embaixador por largueza de vista de dois presidentes que, ao avesso de Bolsonaro, que elege sangue do seu sangue, colheram o talento na família política alheia.

 Um foi Manuel de Campos Sales. Assumiu nem bem o país acalmara de uma guerra civil. Nela, os insurretos contaram com o apoio civil do Partido Monarquista, do qual Nabuco era membro entusiasmado. Nem por isso o governo republicano deixou de indicá-lo para o serviço diplomático. 

 Quem pôs Nabuco de embaixador em Washington foi outro adversário, Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves, indiferente ao fato de terem atuado em partidos opostos durante o Império.

 Nos dois casos, reconheceu-se o preparo acima do partidarismo. Decisões de visão, pois o indicado era notório crítico do regime republicano. É como se Bolsonaro desse cargo a um grão-petista. Nabuco hoje não serviria nem para porteiro do Planalto, pois nascido em Pernambuco, [era autêntico “paraíba”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/termo-paraiba-usado-por-bolsonaro-reflete-preconceito-ao-nordeste-e-cabe-punicao.shtml).

 Nem Bolsonaro é Campos Sales ou Rodrigues Alves nem Eduardo é Joaquim. Dois liberais, mas é semelhança de superfície. Os bolsonaristas taxariam Nabuco de “comunista”, pois ele defendeu direitos civis e políticos, justiça social e livre expressão de ideias, crenças e estilos de vida —sem exclusão dos que o repugnavam, como os consumidores de fast food.

 Para o país, seria ganho inestimável se o 03 refletisse antes de topar a empreitada. Nabuco o fez. Em 20 de maio de 1905, escreveu à esposa: “Estou com medo de ter feito uma grande tolice aceitando este posto, uma grandíssima tolice.” Enganava-se: desempenhou-o à maestria. Agora, ao contrário, não há engano.",1

The study even directly supports the idea that women need less, not more, social interaction than men as they reach a threshold where it doesn't have the same benefit.

I was raised as an atheist, but then experienced some near-death at 17 when I started questioning it. My temperature was over 41.5 degrees celsius, where every pain stopped, I couldn't sleep or locate my limbs and I just were a bit disoriented just before deaths's door. But everything was extremely peaceful. One of my best experiences in life. I regret to this day I didn't die then.

Then at 18-th birthday I got suffocated by CO/CO2 and few people had to smack me to wake me up and I remember getting out of my body and becoming the whole ""scene"", the ""whole"" world. I could see out of my eyes while they were closed. Where everything seems like a blanket thrown over you, and the arms and legs extend into infinity. I **was** the whole universe. Later on salvia trip I **was all creation** that was before this universe. Strangest thing? Everybody describes that this salvia state is already wery known one which you experienced for100-1000s times/

Anotherwise, as if 1/x transformation had took place - you are in the middle and everbody is outside. I had an option to leave everyting and go back to my natural state.  I decided (unfortunately) to not make friends responsible for my death and returned to my body.

[Setihanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sethianism) and [Mahayana Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana_Buddhism) - very detailed book comes to play in here.

After two first unsuccesfull attempts with flu and asphyxiation I had a great revelation while being on Salvia divinorum (use the traditional Mazatec method - chewing, not smoking it! It changes the experience from a state arising from 20 minutes chowing vs being lost in 47th page of some universe and then rocket return back)

So I think the God written in Bible is acutally Demiurg or Yaldabaoth, but not the real ""God"". You are in prison with the rest of us.

My current belief is somewhere between Mahayana Buddhism and Sethianism +/-. I tried several suicides by overdosing on fentayl (50-80x stronger than heroin in effective dose), but I would just pass out and never could die.

But strong opiates are another story. Drugs like Fetanyl and Heroin seem to just completely short-circuit a mammal's evolutionary restrictions on *too much* pleasure. It's just a direct shot of feel-good endorphins that the body was never meant to experience in such a high dose. Getting hooked isn't a mental issue, it's a pure physiological issue that few people have the discipline to stop once they've got a steady supply.

Seu amigo do peito no Reino Unido é Nigel Farage, o líder da direita nacionalista e o mais fanático entre os [arautos do ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/07/boris-johnson-e-novo-lider-conservador-e-deve-se-tornar-premie-do-reino-unido.shtml)[brexit](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/07/boris-johnson-e-novo-lider-conservador-e-deve-se-tornar-premie-do-reino-unido.shtml). Johnson prometeu aos conservadores derrotar tanto Farage quanto Jeremy Corbyn, o esquerdista que comanda o Partido Trabalhista. Mas Trump profetiza que Farage ""trabalhará bem"" com o novo primeiro-ministro. Faz sentido: o Partido Conservador só elegeu Johnson depois de se converter numa seita de fundamentalistas do brexit.

 ""Pense em Margaret Thatcher com cabelo indomável"" —assim, Newt Gingrich, o direitista ex-líder parlamentar do Partido Republicano enalteceu Johnson, oferecendo uma oportunidade inigualável para os caricaturistas. O próprio Johnson exibe-se como um ""modernizador do thatcherismo"", mas seu heroi é Winston Churchill. De qualquer modo, na carruagem retórica do brexit, os dois mais célebres chefes de governo conservadores do século 20 foram recrutados como ícones da cisão britânica com a União Europeia. É história de cartolina: um conto de fadas para ninar crianças de colo.

 Thatcher nunca foi uma europeísta, mas aprendera as lições do passado e, no referendo sobre a adesão britânica à então Comunidade Europeia, em 1975, fez campanha pelo ""sim"" (enquanto, por sinal, Corbyn empenhava-se pelo ""não""). Churchill viveu em outra época, quando a bandeira britânica ainda tremulava sobre colônias espalhadas por todos os continentes. Uma de suas sentenças clássicas —""Se o Reino Unido precisar escolher entre a Europa e o mar aberto, deve sempre escolher o mar aberto""— foi pronunciada em 1944 e, hoje, funciona como uma espécie de hino do brexit. Mas a citação é um recorte esperto: a apropriação política de um estilhaço da história. 

 Churchill não era um inglês provinciano. Em outubro de 1942, após a primeira vitória militar britânica, na batalha de El Alamein, escreveu ao ministro do Exterior, Anthony Eden, que ""enxergo à frente um Estados Unidos da Europa no qual as barreiras entre as nações serão bastante reduzidas"". Ali, encontra-se a semente da ideia explicitada no Discurso de Zurique (1946), que pode ser interpretado tanto como a inauguração da Guerra Fria quanto como uma conclamação à unidade da Europa. E, no verão de 1950, Churchill qualificou como ""atitude miserável"" a recusa do governo trabalhista de Attlee em participar das negociações do Plano Schuman, embrião da Comunidade Europeia.

 Johnson prometeu que seu governo marcará o ""início de uma nova idade de ouro"". A ""idade de ouro"" do Império Britânico tinha ficado para trás quando Churchill dirigiu sua áspera crítica a Attlee. Naquela hora, três anos depois da independência da Índia, a Europa já surgia como destino inevitável do Reino Unido. E, como Thatcher, um quarto de século mais tarde, Churchill entendia o significado político do projeto europeu. A unidade da Europa, eles sabiam, era uma ferramenta para conter a URSS e esculpir, no lugar da ""Europa alemã"" sonhada por Hitler, uma ""Alemanha europeia"".

 O brexit obedece a dois comandos ideológicos. De um lado, veicula uma nostalgia imperial: o desejo de retroceder o relógio à ""idade de ouro"". De outro, exprime o nacionalismo xenófobo de uma Inglaterra insular, avessa ao cosmopolitismo e à imigração. Na base da ruptura com a União Europeia encontra-se a crise geral do sistema político britânico e a crise singular que ameaça desmantelar o Partido Conservador.

 ""Não compartilho a opinião otimista que ele tem de si mesmo"". O [novo primeiro-ministro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/podcasts/2019/07/podcast-conta-quem-e-boris-johnson-novo-premie-do-reino-unido-ouca.shtml) foi recebido com sarcasmo por Dominic Grieve, da rarefeita ala europeísta do Partido Conservador. O ""charlatão"", na definição de Grieve, é o agente perfeito para consumar o desastre do brexit.

68,2019-07-27 13:07:03+00:00,"Hey man,

I kinda lost the source of my informations about this type of diaphragmatic breathing years ago. It was from a .pdf chapter of some translated indian book of life or something... back then I was lying in a hospital for 4+ weeks with more and more complications and inflammations turning up every now and then, while I was on oxycodon with no clear date of getting better... Long story short: I had a lot of time and no outlet for my energy.

This type of breathing (-meditation) is super simple. It's basically only breathing out as much as you can. You only concentrate on emptying your lungs as completely as you can. Obviously only as long as you feel comfortable, which can be varying for each breath, so no pressure. Just concentrate on breathing out... and then let your body breath in the way it automatically does. When you feel like your lung is full manually breath out, emptying your lung again as much as comfortable... if you're bored you can test your limits with it, but this type of breathing is half about manually breathing out and half about relaxing while your body is automatically breathing in.

In the beginning, after about half a minute I felt a little dizzy, maybe sweated a bit - almost as if somebody is hyperventilating. But if you keep doing this, your head becomes very clear, your whole upper body kinda relaxes from this ""internal breath massage"" and even makes noises... as if you were unconsciously cramped and imbalanced before, it's hard to explain.

There is a lot of conflicting information about meditation online. Everybody who 'keeps searching the perfect meditation' will find more and more conflicts, the more he/she is searching for the perfect meditation. So I'd go for types of meditation that give scientifically proven benefits outside of spiritual anectdotes as well. But that's just me.

Most cultures heavily emphasize the breath. Everybody has to breath to live. So I guess optimizing the breath is something good, no matter if other goals are achieved or not.

So... while I was lying in the hospital bed and started doing this breathing meditation at 5-6 o'clock in the morning after a night without sleep, while being sure some nurse will hinder me from sleep for most of the day, I tried to 'pretend to be asleep while breathing out deeply'. Again and again. First I felt dizzy and a bit sweaty... afte a few minutes instead of dizzy I felt very clear headed and way less in pain...

Breathing like this for more than 10 minutes makes you feel like you are deprived of oxygen in your everyday life... The moment the new oxygen level while breathing deeply becomes your new baseline, you should have achieved most benefits which usually get attributed to meditation. To be exact; 'short breathing' feels even a little stiffling, as if you lack oxygen to function optimally.

Within one or two days of breathing like this I was able to reduce the pain meds, within 3-4 days my dismissal could be discussed and within one week I was at home, as healthy as somebody who was in hospital for ~6ish weeks could be. Obviously I can't be sure that this type of breathing helped me to 'get well' faster, or if my health would have improved at this point without it anyway... 

But the other benefits (clear head, calmness, less suffering from a shitty situation with insufficient pain meds) were pretty good.

When I was at home I didn't practice this type of breathing for much longer... sometimes I did it while playing E-sports titles, which felt like playing while being distracted, but I was actually playing better like this than while playing without 'conscious deep breathing'.

Long story short: Deep breath = good, no matter what. If you could make this type of conscious deep breathing (out) a habit, your other athletic and spiritual goals would be waaaaay easier to achieve.",1

71,2019-07-27 04:20:34+00:00,"Hydro-morphone is pretty well up there on the strength ladder of opioids. You sure its not hydro-codone? That's the fairly weak one you usually get from general docs. What it sounds like you really need is a slow release drug that will give you a constant dose. If its hydrocodone, the long acting drug is xtampza. If its hydromorphone, the long acting version is called Exalgo. It makes a huge difference being on a long acting round the clock regimen. The idea is to knock the pain back and keep it from coming back instead of waiting for it to hurt. There is also the possibility you might do well on an implanted medication pump. There are some down sides to it that you should check out before deciding on something like that, but it sounds like you got crushed pretty good and are probably already experienced with surgeries, so a pump may not be that big a deal. That's pretty much the max they can do for you in the way of pain relief. The way the pump administers the drug directly in to the spinal canal it can increase the strength of whatever they use 3x -6x. Dont expect miracles, there is only so much they can do and it sounds like you already know what they are willing to do is far less. You need to keep pushing your doc to see the specialist. Squeaky wheel gets the grease.

Do you own a TENS unit by any chance? They probably slapped one of these little electrical massage thingies on you in your rehab PT, but its very different owning one that you can set for your own comfort level and wear as long as you want to. Good for all types of pain but you may need to have it on for a while for it to knock out some of the more stubborn pain issues. Definitely pick one up online (keep it simple, keep it cheap, no more than $50) and keep on your doc. Its not their pain, so its easy for them to forget and if youre not pushing, they wont take you as seriously.  Your regular doc has actually done pretty well by you as far as how much they will usually do, so your injuries are probably pretty evident to any doctor, so I wouldnt think a pain doc would play their usual games with you. These days you never know though. Keep pushing your regular doc for that specialist referral, just in case you do get one that wants to play games that way you wont waste a lot of time looking for a real pain doctor.

That's about all I can think of for the moment. Sometimes they cant totally relieve your pain and still give you a quality of life that you can move around and do stuff, but they should be able to make the pain something that can be easily ignored most of the time. Sometimes you just have to deal the best you can. Above hydromorphone you pretty much only have oxymorphone and fentanyl. Methadone too. Its a strong drug but only available for pain in 10mg tablets, so the dose may not be that much but it looks like a lot to everyone. And methadone is cheap compared to all the other opioid pain relievers, if money is an issue (when isnt it?). Good luck and hang in there and keep pestering your doc to take your pain more seriously. Pick up a TENS too, even if you found it uncomfortable in therapy. You can adjust most of that out and still have it help. Take care.",1

   Berlim (Pedro Alonso) e Professor (Alvaro Morte) em cena de ""La casa de papel"" Foto: Reprodução   Um dos motivos que tornam os personagens de ""La casa de papel"" tão queridos pelo público é que eles não estão no mundo do crime apenas pelo dinheiro. Existe todo um romantismo por trás dos planos do Professor (Álvaro Morte). Na nova temporada, recém-lançada pela Netflix, por exemplo, o objetivo é resgatar um dos membros do grupo, capturado pela polícia. A série prende a atenção, diverte e tem um elenco carismático.

   Cena de 'Breaking bad' Foto: Divulgação   Uma das melhores séries da chamada “era do ouro” da televisão, ""Breaking bad"" conta a história de um bom homem comum, Walter White (Bryan Cranston), que cruza a fronteira moral do mau comportamento depois de descobrir um câncer no pulmão. A motivação (pelo menos inicial) que o leva para a criminalidade é a preocupação com o futuro da família após a sua morte. Passados tantos anos da estreia (em 2008), a atração continua cheia de frescor e surpresa.

Totalmente integrado às regras da organização mafiosa a que pertencia, ele era capaz de atos de profunda crueldade.

I come from the batch of 1 SIR right after Dave Teo stole the rifle and ammunition from mandai hill camp . For those of you too young to remember, google the name and read about the case. Dave stole the weapon in september 2007, I joined 1SIR in dec 2007.

Now, because I was the incoming batch of commanders, there was a new CO who joined 1SIR just before we entered, I believe just before the rifle incident happened. So he was in the wrong place at the wrong time when it went down. SAF, being SAF, had to find someone to blame as usual- witch hunt and all. CO didnt get blamed exactly, but suffice to say his career prospects henceforth didnt look too bright. 

Many of our platoon sergeants had served with Dave and knew him as a good soldier, if misunderstoood with a very sad childhood (you can check out the asiaone story on him). Many of them signed a petition asking for leniency and wanted to go to Dave's sentencing to show their support. 

The above said CO heard about the petition, signed it, attended the hearing, and read the petition to the judge for leniency on account of Dave's troubled childhood and good behavior as a soldier. Remember, this CO didn't know Dave, was at the wrong place at the wrong time to catch the shit, and just had his career torpedoed by Dave. This was a nice thing to do. 

Now, I won't pretend that the CO in question 
Was a great leader or that he wasn't flawed, he certainly was not the greatest commander out there. But he did a nice thing for dave. 

Also made a good friend in unit who was a regular PC (not my PC) though. One of the best leaders I ever met, surely would have been chief of army one day had he stayed. Was never afraid to muck in and do 'men and spec' work. Would honestly be comfortable going to war with this guy, he was that good.This guy introduced me to cycling and gave me an expensive pair of cycling shoes when I was a poor NSF.",1

125,2019-07-23 12:57:17+00:00,"Leyendo comentarios abajo veo que la gente comenta desde sus propias experiencias, lo cual me parece lo mejor en tu caso ya que no estamos en un entorno clinico. Yo te voy a dar varias opiniones,  como fumadora y  como clinica, y tambien debo decirte que mis opiniones difieren con cada paciente, opino que lo que le va bien a una persona puede ser veneno para otra, y me explico como ha hecho todo el mundo poniendome yo de ejemplo. 

&amp;#x200B;

Por ejemplo con el cafe. Como sociedad, el cafe esta super aceptado y no se si habras escuchado alguna vez que tambien es una droga, lo es. Yo soy una persona extremadamente tranquila, a mi el cafe no me hace nada, y cuando tomaba mas de lo normal (mas de una taza) me daba unas taquicardias locas. Joder hace 2 meses tuve que mandar a un paciente a urgencias con taquicardias tambien porque se bebio dos redbulls de medio litro mezclado con su medicacion normal. Diras que coño me esta contando de red bulls y de cafes, con esto te quiero decir que hasta las sustancias que consideramos inocuas llegan a ser perjudiciales en grandes cantidades o cuando no se controla. Joder, sabes que es la potomania? Ha habido muertes por esto tambien, adiccion a beber agua, a tal grado que te jodes los riñones. Esto lo enlazo con el cannabis, dices que fumas felizmente, yo tambien fumo felizmente, trato un desorden hormonal que tengo con el, evito el dolor asociado, y tambien evito tomar pastillas. No se me olvida que es una droga tambien, pero en mi caso entre lo malo escogi lo menos malo, como cuando vas a votar.

&amp;#x200B;

El cannabis es un mundo, se puede tener una vida totalmente funcional mientras se fuma. He visto muy de cerca los beneficios en epilepsia, esclerosis multiple y dolor congenito, y son para tirar cohetes literalmente, sobrepasan con matricula de honor a cualquier tratamiento actual. No hay tratamiento medico para las migrañas, pero el CBD esta haciendo maravillas por ejemplo, tambien como antineoplasico y paliando las nauseas despues de la quimio.

 Lo que yo si veo muy a menudo es gente culpando al cannabis o a la droga de eleccion (videojuegos, movil etc) por todos sus problemas. He nombrado ""drogas"" con dependencia psicologica pero no fisica.  Yo podria quedarme en casa fumando y no ir a currar, o podria haberme quedado fumando y no ir a la facultad o a estudiar, lo que no voy a hacer es culpar a una droga bastante inocua dejame decirte (ya que no hay dependencia fisica como en la heroina por ejemplo) por dejarme llevar en placeres hedonistas. Reconozco que el cannabis favorece el hedonismo, abandonarte a placeres y no hacer nada, es muy relajante y por eso funciona tan bien en ansiedad (otra vez en bajos niveles, proporciones 1.1 de thc y cbd, mas thc que cbd por ejemplo es ansiogeno) . Dicho esto, otra cosa que he visto en consumidores habituales de cannabis es algo que los psicologos denominan como ""sindrome amotivacional"". Esto no esta recogido en la DSM y a dia de hoy dudo de si es un sindrome real, el caso es que si he visto en consumidores que pierden totalmente la motivacion y pasan de hacer vida social y tal, lo que no se es si culpar directamente al cannabis o a una depresion latente o que se esta manifestando, por estos consumidores que viven atrapados en el mismo dia a diario, el dia de la marmota. No se si hay causalidad entre el consumo de cannabis y la falta de vida social/motivacion, sinceramente ahi no se que decirte, pero voy a ser coherente, seguramente sea una mezcla de ambas, depresion y cannabis.

&amp;#x200B;

Otra cosa que si tengo que comentarte son las edades donde empezaste el consumo. Empezaste muy jovencito, y es cierto que el cannabis no crea dependencia fisica, pero si psicologica (el habito), y la nicotina crea bastante dependencia fisica, aparte refieres que tienes alta tolerancia a esta. Yo a mis pacientes a no ser que me refieran sentimientos egodistonicos/ que me digan oye esto no me funciona en mi vida, no estoy feliz con esto, no intervengo. No depende de mi decidir que es un comportamiento normativo, que esta bien y que esta mal, no soy dios, pero se que muchos profesionales clinicos y sobre todo en estos ambitos de la salud mental si que se consideran dioses. Te voy a decir que sea peor fumar tabaco y cannabis que usar opiaceos? te voy a decir que es peor fumar cannabis que cambiarlo por antidepresivos o ansioliticos? jamas. Todo el mundo tiene su droga para sobrevivir en esta sociedad de mierda desgraciadamente, aun asi por favor no escojas la heroina ni la cocaina para hacer frente jaja. 

&amp;#x200B;

Si despues de toda esta biblia que te he escrito (si la lees) decides dejarlo, sin cambiar una droga por otra, me parecera fantastico, tu eres quien conoce tu vida mejor que cualquier clinico especializado en adicciones, aun asi si quieres consejo escribeme que estare encantada de facilitartelo.

I got right into PM,after they made sure i had top notch insurance. They continued the 80mgs of methadone a day until they suggested me switching to another med. That was the fentanyl patch. I was on 100mgs to 80mgs when they cut my methadone to 40 and put a 25mcg patch for 2 weeks and then no methadone and a 50mcg patch, which wasn't cutting it. My next appt. Was a 75mcg and some oxy for breakthrough. Worked great for getting off methadone, completely covered my pain any withdrawal or PAWS. I Screwed up at my Pain Clinic and they did a very fast taper from 200mgs of Oxycontin and instant release oxy. I had rotated from the patch to Oxy. It was that or go to 100mcg patch which at the time I wanted off of it, side effects (withdrawal,severe anxiety mostly) patch wasnt lasting 48 hours. my primary has been kind enough to perscribe methadone for now.

Primeiro, esses são provavelmente viciados em heroina e metanfetamina. Esse problema é tão grande nos estados unidos quanto o crack no Brasil. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tudo começou há anos atrás quando os americanos receitavam Oxycontin (heroina em forma de comprimidos) para QUALQUER dor que sentiam, até mesmo após sairem dos dentistas. Isso tudo tornou a droga muito comum e banal entre os jovens, o que acarretou em inúmeras mortes por overdose e obrigou o governo a interferir e liberar o medicamento apenas em casos extremos. (Existe um episódio que as pirulas foram distribuídas de graça na Flórida)

&amp;#x200B;

Os viciados em heroina tem o mesmo problema que os de crack, simplesmente perdem vontade de viver e só vivem em relação ao vicio, por isso geralmente viram moradores de rua. O que o cara está mostrando em Los Angeles não é diferente de muitos outros lugares americanos, com estados republicanos. Inclusive, California nem está entre os estados com mais usuários de heroina nos EUA ( [https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-summaries-by-state](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-summaries-by-state) ).",0

But fentanyl is pretty ugly. Unfortunately even if we could keep imports from Mexico out - it comes by vehicle mostly, so that means it fets smuggled in at ports of entry or semi-submersible craft, or flown in - very little has to do with a need for a physical wall - even if, Chinese fentanyl is nothing to sneeze at. Back in the nineties “China White” heroin was king. Now Mexico is growing more opium and Trump asked China to reclassify fetanyl as a controlled substance or something. Have to look the last one up.

What we really need to is fix the “shithole countries” but that’s hard work against entrenched and well funded corruption. I don’t see the demand for drugs going down

I played softball four times a week, reffed basketball for 6 hours Saturday and Sunday.

I got to really like the pills. They worked.

Went in a month and a half later, saw MY doctor, and he was pissed. Did proper tests, and sent me to physio. The pills caused more harm than good. I pushed my body beyond be what it should have. 

Year of physio, I was in constant pain, but I refused to take anything. I knew I wanted to, badly. No Tylenol, advil, anything.

Fast forward, and I now have Ankylosing spondylitis. Triggered by the injury? Maybe, doctor thinks it's possible that's what activated it. It caused incredible pain, but because of that asshole doctor, I refuse to take pain medication. 

I'm on other things to help manage the pain, but no painkillers. It limits what I can do. All because of one, lazy, indifferent doctor. I was lucky, that's it. My personal doctor saw what happened. Had he just given me more pain killers... I know my life would be much worse",19

Commonly reffered to as Mac, or big Mac, Anthony was a genuine fun time to be around. He could never be quiet if he found something funny, stiffling giggles louder than most regular laughs. He loved to lift weights and had the ""trap-walk"" where he swayed and waddled side to side. Anthony and I met when I first moved to a new school, he invited me to eat lunch at his table with the line ""hey man do you smoke weed cause you should come over here if you do"" I had smoked weed once ever (this was tenth grade) and wanted to make a quick friend. So I sat down, and met someone really easy to relate to, and talk to. I got up and walked away from lunch only to see Anthony in the same class after lunch ""keyboard processing"" which was easy as pie and a great class to goof off in. Which led to a great friendship lasting up untill the heroin addiction started four years ago. 

Anthony overdosed two years ago in August after purchasing 26 bags of heroin with fentynyl unknowingly laced in the bags, with the intention of calling one of our friends for every bag he would inject; he made it through two bags, and two calls. Neither friend answered the call. It was Anthony's first relapse in three months after a successful inpatient rehab program. His parents are diner with him, he went to his room for only fifteen minutes before he was found with zero vitals. 

His morals were questionable from the start, and everyone knew to never leave a dollar near him, he's stolen probably hundreds of dollars from all our friends but we knew the type of person he was, and he would never claim to be anything other than who he was. But none of our friends would ever expect this outcome. If you are or someone you know is doing heroin please get them imeadiate help and therapy, it may save their life.

I have panic disorder and depression so when I started having other crazy symptoms, my doctors dismissed it as a ""somatoform"" disorder. They would tell me it was anxiety-related or that I was a hypochondriac. Believe me, panic disorder suffers have so much stress on their bodies that it's not surprising if other things go wrong. Not all of it was obvious, but to me I was suffering immensely every day.

Then I started to get blood work that was slightly off - a raised WBC and a chronic low grade fever. I was nauseous and I started to get swollen lymph nodes in my groin. I lost weight. I was sweating during sleep. Every day my fever was between 99.0-99.9 but the doctors said that is not abnormal, some people just run hot. I bought a thermometer and would check all day long - just like a hypochondriac. 

I saw about 5 doctors who told me nothing was wrong and it was anxiety or all in my head. I told them I was dying and I was in tears every time I went. I was losing my faith in them.

After 2 years of this I went to a new doctor and she sent me for an allergy test. Turns out I was allergic to almost everything they tested me for, including peanuts, shellfish, wheat, all fruits, all vegetables. I had true food allergies, which they said at the time was rare.

I immediately cut out the foods that were I had the highest levels of allergens and within 2 weeks, my fever was gone, my weight was coming back, no more nausea, normal blood counts, etc.

This also happened to my twin. She was also chronically ill with symptoms dismissed by her doctor as ""nothing"". It turned out to be morphea, a type of scleroderma. She dealt with symptoms for 10 years before they knew what it was.

220,2019-07-16 14:00:36+00:00,"Just to clarify I did not initially have an NG Tube. Here is the progression of events for me:

- Morning of surgery: Nurses shaved my chest, and gave me the painless IV in my arm/hand.
- Taken into operating theatre: Tried to put epidural on while I'm still awake (painless) but clearly that was a failure.
-  All ready! I fall asleep on the countdown from 10.
- Surgery starts and obviously I am unaware of nothing for next 8 hours. First thing they do is put neck IV in and a third IV as well in other arm. Then they do surgery.
- I wake normally to no significant pain or anything in the recovery room. I'm given the button to the hydro-morphone and told to push it when I feel pain. The patient has to give themselves the hydro-morphone. They can't decide that for you. I think it's for ethical reasons.
- Once I'm stable I'm moved to the post-op room. First 24 hours I have a dedicated nurse for me who is constantly monitoring me and all the equipment I'm connected to. Standard major surgery stuff.

This is where things should start to normalize if you had an epidural. Because you will feel ZERO pain for the next week or so. Unfortunately because the epidural didn't work here's what happens next:

- My stomach is slowly filling with bile from the hydromorphone excretion. My colon isn't working yet (this happens to all of us from the anaesthesia).  I also have to keep pushing that hydromorphone button otherwise the pain is excruciating. 

- 3 days in: projectile vomiting from the bile. Doctors worried that my incision will open. I'm not supposed to be putting any strain on my stomach. And this is when they say I must have an NG-tube to suck out the bile.

So don't worry, you may never need an NG-tube if you get a epidural 👍",2

I disagree with that because you have seperated drugs into categories of ""these are the good ones that have the ability to be used correctly"" and ""these are evil and have no ability to be used responsably""

Opioids, when taken responsibly doesn't just kill people. Overdoses kill people, laced drugs kill people, and ultimately what happens a lot of the time is irresponsible actions kill people. These people that you speak of that died in the opioid epidemic didn't drop like flies because they were given a bottle of oxycotin. They either abused them or died from addictions from the opioids that they were put on because they were poorly warned by a medical professional if they actually needed it or not. Opioid related death doesn't just fall out of the sky. Ever. It isn't something that just happens for no reason. It always, I cannot say it enough, always has a reason behind it. And 96% of the time that reason will be an overdose of some sort. Not by medical diagnosis or by the doctor writing too many zeros on the milligrams of the bottle, but because somebody knowingly took much more than they were suppost to without knowing the true repercussions. 

Saying that heroin and methamphetamine cannot be taken responsibly is a very foolish and hyperbolic statement to say. Let me give a counterpoint here by saying that we perscribe children what is essentially 1 oxygen atom and a few hydrogens away from methamphetamine to treat a very common mental affliction aka we give kids aderall(dextroamphetamine) for adhd. If it is so impossible to do methamphetamine responsably than why do we give children(and many adults) a cousin of it for a pretty common mental issue. Meth isn't harder to abuse than other drugs, it isn't easier either. It just simply has more addictive qualities. I know many people that have tried drugs within the class of opioid/opiate or stimulate or amphetamine and ultimately they just went ""that was great but I'm fine not doing this again""",1

 He's always been violent but our dad passed away at the beginning of the year due to a guy claiming to sell haroin gave him some fentanyl instead. We were all very upset. His moodswings got so bad that he would attack his girlfriend shoving her. Eventually he attacked my cousin and we had to call the police. His rude and dangerious mood swings have been a thing for him since he was a kid. Violent tempertantrums. He made holes in the walls destroyed items left to the family by his own mother and just constantly broke stuff. He refused to get help for his bipolar disorder.

 He wasn't so bad when he was on his medication but he just didn't want help. Right before my dad passed away he actually would get into severe arguements with him. To the point where he would actually fight and hurt my dad.. he pushed him down the stairs one time and cause some severe foot issues that my father refused to go to the hospital for.

 The night before my dad died. My half brother got into a really bad arguement and started attacking father. He had enough of the kid (18) and finally punched him in the face so hard he said he made him see stars. He ended up getting a really bad mug shot when he got arrested the next day for attacking my cousin. His lip was all messed up and he made an ass of himself. 

The one thing my father kept telling him was ""I only want to help you, You're gonna have a really hard life."" His words will forever ring out in my mind. He started immediately demanding half of everything my father had. And he ended up living with his girlfriend because dad was gone and no one wanted him. 

He burned so many bridges long before this point. When he went to jail his bail was set at 50$. And he begged all of us.. but because he was so disliked. Not one of us would step forward for him. 

Honestly live is so much less stressful without him in the picture. I really hope he gets help but all I hear is how he hates all of the family and that he sells drugs out of his girlfriends house.. her story is pretty bad too but that's another story..",1

Hope this answers most of your questions, LMK if not with a PM.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be more accurate that there are certain opioids, namely, most all of those that very similar to morphine in structure such as oxy/hydro/codone/morphine, heroin and other o-substituted version, etc. The list is absurdly long if you try to include most of those that have ever seen widespread use. I can't quite speak for all of them but those that I named have especially small differences between them in subjective effect. Though perhaps a bit more so in onset time, duration etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having researched and indeed tried a great many of the opioids out there, I would have to tell you that the difference between injection of heroin/morphine/oxy would almost certainly be unnoticeable in a blind test to anyone but the most attentive, somatically minded and opioid-experienced folks out there. 

Now morphine versus tramadol, or morphine versus fent or U47700? In those cases I believe most people likely could distinguish between them in a blind test just as long as they focused a little bit and learned to differences.

As a rule though, fent type analogs will very likely feel identical to fent, and the same is true for each family of molecules you can name. 

There's also more heavily altered morphine-like opioids such as buprenorphine or etorphine, both of which I think most would find not quite the same as with the simpler -codones and -morphines and -morphones. I haven't done etorphine as it's so rare but I can vouch for bupe without a doubt, it feels a noticeable shade different for being a kappa-opioid blocker rather than a weak kappa agonist as are most of your inner circle of the morphine related opioids. 

Another term you hear sometimes is ""phenanthrene opioids"" with is basically the broadest interpretation of what being a ""morphine-like opioid"" could include. Phenanthrene referring to the core 3 fused rings of the carbon skeleton associated with morphine.

And admittedly there are some massively bizarre opioids out there too, notably the kappa agonists, which do technically also kill pain, but at the same for whatever reason also cause sickening dysphoria and dissociative-like hallucinations. You have your pure kappa opis, like pentazocine which nonetheless were actually once used for pain (likely due to some doctors out there desperate to find any effective painkiller that isn't mu-opioids, there also highly experimental delta agonists, which are thought to be similar to the mu agonists in effect, but perhaps with less sedation and risk of slow breathing. 

&amp;#x200B;

But people rarely think of freaking salvinorin A as an opioid even if it is according to our naming conventions. I'd argue that that inner circle of morphine-like analogs are overwhelming what comes to mind when you think of opioids or opiates. They're all basically just mu-agonists, thou sometimes with a tiny pinch of that kappa-related tendency to get pang of dysphoria randomly. If you do these a lot you may notice, it's common that 2 hours into your high, after having only felt great until that point, you get a sudden, ephemeral flash of unease and malaise, anxiety and frustration. Of course it usually leaves just as soon as it comes. Still, this has the side of effect that it can prompt people to take even more when they shouldn't, because doing so usually makes the mu effective seem to quickly take back over. You never see more than the ghost of a kappa affect, but still it can lead to accidental overdose from obsessive redosing more easily than the  kappa neutral opioids like fent, with the kappa blocking opioids like bupe being the opposite, having a character that lends itself more naturally to moderate, controlled use. 

You might be shocked how even when deep into a heroin/morph/oxy high, a person will somehow still get those flashes of angst, with the crawling feeling they leave on your skin and in your gut. Worst thing about them is enough is seldom enough; they give the peaceful, worry free silence of the mind you want for long periods in truth, but time seems to pass quickly when you are feeling content and free from pain, and each little flash is a nasty surprise, yet so subtle that most people don't even really realize what's happening... I learned the hard way as many others did. Only once I had binged 70 bucks worth of extremely high quality internet black tar heroin (let know one say black tar cannot be so), smoking, snorting etc over a single day, from dawn til dusk, by the end of which I felt so high that it almost like a disorienting, dissociating drunkenness, claustrophobically strong mu effects. That was with no tolerance/dependence either, I'm sure if I had shot the whole thing at once instead of parceling it out over the hours, it would have likely killed me, and at a minimum make me comatose..

&amp;#x200B;

 Lol just trying to drop a hint: that you should come to see that the whole idea that heroin is somehow intrinsically a better, more intense high than any other similar drug, it's just an arbitrary load of BS. While in practice street heroin can seem like a more extreme experience than say pills, this is almost entirely because you tend to shoot it, or at least smoke or snort it. Trying doing the same with pills, and you'll undoubtedly have a much ideal time of it just because of how they formulated. The supposed ""heroin special euphoria"" is really just an ""IV special euphoria"" in truth. The needle indeed, for those who use them, has an uncanny way of hypnotizing you a muddle mix of awe and wonder, flooding relief, but also fear, frustration (should you fail to hit a vein) and a sprinkle of masochism (you are stabbing your veins after all, IVing is bloody business, especially if you're anything less than an expert at hitting veins with flawless veins to use (read: virtually no one). It's almost a fetish of sorts, one that gets fused into the drug effect of the substance being injected in terms of reward and salient.

&amp;#x200B;

Fentanyl has been gaining on them for some uses, but the fent could undoubtedly be said to be the closest neighbor to the morphine family in terms of effects. The fent family's only defining differences is their somewhat more sedating/less stimulating high, their slightly lower incidence of itching and nausea as side effects, and in general the ""smooth"" or ""pure"" character they carry, for the most part as a result of being highly potent and highly specific for the mu opioid receptor.",1

I definitely agree that most people don't know and don't care about things like this, and defer to experts because they don't want to think about it.

Another point of agreement is that textbooks on history can be quite misleading about what evidence there is, and how reliable it is. I know that the primary sources for things older than a thousand years almost never still exist (with a very small number of exceptions).

However, I think it's unfair to historians to say that they merely read things in books and copy them into other books. Much of historical research is actually interested in asking *exactly these questions* about historical sources and how much to trust them. Textbooks can present an oversimplified picture of ""how we know what we know"", but my impression is that historians are actually acutely aware of (and very open about) the difficulties of evaluating fragments of manuscripts that might misquote other manuscripts, themselves misquoting older manuscripts. They often write about this difficulty: For example, specifically about Herodotus, there's this note by a historian engaged in compiling a modern edition of Herodotus from the existing manuscripts: [https://www.persee.fr/doc/antiq\_0770-2817\_1983\_num\_52\_1\_2086](https://www.persee.fr/doc/antiq_0770-2817_1983_num_52_1_2086).

I have actually questioned things like carbon dating; it turns out to be a little difficult to do all the relevant experiments yourself, but as you can read in [http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I\_05.html](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_05.html) (by Richard Feynman, another example of someone who's very interested in how we (think we) know what we do), physicists have done experiments that back up the science behind carbon dating. I don't mean that you shouldn't try to do experiments yourself, but I do believe physics textbooks much more readily than history textbooks. Physicists' whole way of working involves doing experiments and checking each other's results, and the fruit of their collective labor is a set of models of the world that explain what we see on a day-to-day basis *and* do so to such a degree that we can build crazy-seeming technologies like nuclear power plants, microchips, and space shuttles, which you can see with your own eyes. So if physicists collectively say ""carbon dating works"", I definitely believe them.

Which brings me to the point of that blog post I linked. I forgot how long it was, sorry; the important part is at the end (A-E), and isn't about any particular set of conspiracy theories, but is just a way to think about which conspiracy theories are likely to be true. Its ""Basic Argument Against Conspiracy Theories"" applies really strongly to historical research. In order for some political group to be pushing false stories about ancient history via academic historians, they'd need to somehow be controlling many thousands of people (3000 in the US), forcing them to promote ideas about the past that they know aren't based in fact, all of whom presumably got into history because they were interested in researching and explaining what really happened in the past. You might be able to do that if it was 100 people, but 3000 seems really implausible.",3

254,2019-07-14 07:02:37+00:00," Li estarrecido, quando estava a caminho de Matera, na Itália, há duas semanas, o [incrível tuíte de Sergio Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/bernardo-carvalho/2019/06/justica-no-caso-de-moro-e-ideia-fora-do-lugar.shtml) (“Eu vejo, eu ouço”).

 O tom messiânico, [sinistro e desavergonhado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/bernardo-carvalho/2019/06/o-recalque-e-o-ressentimento-tomaram-conta-do-pais.shtml) continua a retumbar na minha cabeça, contra o pano de fundo daquela cidade de grutas, [onde Pasolini filmou](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2016/08/1807344-pasolini-utopias-e-distopias-por-walter-salles.shtml) “O Evangelho Segundo São Mateus” (1964).

 Moro e Pasolini representam extremos opostos no vasto espectro do caráter humano.

 Numa entrevista a Oswald Stack, em 1968, o cineasta comenta a ambiguidade e a contradição do “Evangelho”: “Eu não queria reconstruir a vida de Cristo como ela de fato foi; queria fazer a história de Cristo, mais 2.000 anos de tradução cristã, porque foram esses 2.000 anos de história cristã que mitificaram essa biografia que em si mesma seria quase insignificante. (...) É um filme violentamente contraditório, desconcertante e ambíguo”.

 Moro escreveu seu tuíte em [apoio às manifestações](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/angela-alonso/2019/07/sem-aconchego-do-antipetismo-patriotas-fazem-protesto-a-favor.shtml) que o apoiavam. A frase ecoa um messianismo calculado, ainda mais contraditório e desconcertante na boca de um ex-juiz e ministro da Justiça encurralado pelos fatos. Dá a entender que à Justiça cabe corresponder ao clamor das ruas e apelar para a opinião pública quando questionada.

 [O ex-juiz nunca hesitou em invocar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/angela-alonso/2019/06/so-nao-viram-deslizes-do-heroi-moro-os-cegos-de-odio-pelo-vilao.shtml) para si a imagem de justiceiro, mas não lhe passaria pela cabeça contrariar o público em nome da justiça. Ao contrário, conta com as massas para salvar a própria pele. Age como político populista. É aí que está o mais assustador.

 Ao ironizar no Congresso que Sérgio Cabral, Eduardo Cunha e Renato Duque também precisam de defensores, Moro se entrega por meio do sofisma. Revela que afinal sabe muito bem a diferença entre esses e Lula (se não soubesse, não precisaria recorrer à comparação). Abusa da nossa honestidade intelectual. Ameaça-nos com o risco do fim da Lava Jato para desviar a atenção dos próprios abusos.

 No extremo oposto, [Pasolini era guiado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/03/internet-e-capital-financeiro-embacaram-o-mundo-diz-guilherme-wisnik.shtml) por uma independência radical de pensamento, capaz de fazê-lo voltar-se não só contra o público mas contra si mesmo, em nome da verdade, da justiça, do combate aos consensos e às ideias confortáveis, mas enganadoras. A última coisa que levava em conta era zelar pela própria imagem. 

 Chame-se a isso de coragem, desprendimento ou suicídio, essa costuma ser uma qualidade comum aos loucos, mas também aos grandes artistas e aos homens dignos da categoria de heróis.

 Horas antes de ser assassinado, em novembro de 1975, Pasolini concedeu uma entrevista publicada no jornal La Stampa e reeditada em livro com o título “Estamos todos em perigo”. Referia-se ao hedonismo consumista que nos leva a desejar as mesmas coisas.

 Contra a normatização, Pasolini defendia as singularidades, uma relação mais sensual e vital com a natureza e com o mundo. Para ele, não havia nada mais fácil e traiçoeiro do que exaltar o bem e execrar o mal quando isso apenas reverbera o que todo mundo pensa ou acredita pensar, na inércia de uma manipulação, histeria ou alucinação coletiva.

 Sobre a ambiguidade do autodenominado “homem de bem”, incapaz de reconhecer contradição em si mesmo, Pasolini usa a metáfora admonitória da água que mata a sede mas também afoga. Será mesmo tão difícil entender que muitas vezes defendemos o que nos põe em perigo?

 A esta altura deve estar difícil até para os mais crentes defender que Moro seja quem ele diz que é, em contradição com seus atos. Ainda que, frio e calculista, guardasse na manga uma cartada estratégica (só se voltar contra o capitão ao qual vem atendendo servilmente, na reta final, quando pudesse enfim sair da sombra abjeta para se impor como alternativa ao horror), o ex-juiz contaria com um inimigo fatal em si mesmo. Ninguém se associa ao horror impunemente. Em sintonia com o chefe, lida muito mal com a contradição e o dissenso.

 Até aqui, Moro tem se escorado na ressonância do público que ele diz ver e ouvir, mas ao qual embaça e abafa o acesso à verdade. Incapaz de se defender, delega ao público o veredicto crédulo e devoto sobre seu destino. Pede fé e em troca oferece o pau oco.

 Matera comemora em 2 de julho a sagração da Madonna della Bruna. Um desfile toma as ruas da cidade sob os aplausos do público. No final, a mesma turba que aplaudia avança sobre o carro principal, de papel machê, e o destrói num ato de aparente vandalismo.

My local hospital is around 700m from where I live. The hospital I had SRS at is about 150km away. I wasn't allowed to drive because of being on morphene.

Anyway, I was urinating blood for 5 days, went up to the ER, got some antibiotics from them, but they refused to oull the catheter, despite it being time, and it leaking.

Wow, I didn't even know Heroin was legal at all in the UK, that's good.

I can't even take 500mg of it without my abdomen hurting a lot, though I am sensitive to that side effect due to my previous extensive use of it for chronic pain before I had better pain management.

It's way cheaper to use heroin than codeine in the US, too.

269,2019-07-12 16:58:22+00:00,"I can tell you from personal experience with being on Suboxone, doctors will often prescribe twice or even three times the amount necessary for withdrawal.

Suboxone is so strong, that 8mgs is usually more than enough to curb a daily heroin addiction. But people I know and even myself have been on upwards up 24mgs to even 32mgs. This produces hellish withdrawal when trying to come off and is definitely more than any one person would ever need.

And what happens most of the time is people end up selling their extra Suboxone and the spiral continues. Any addict will eventually discover they done need four 8mgs a day. And at ten bucks per 8mg strip, addicts fall back into their addictive behavior. 

What I'm saying is if the doctors prescribe more than is needed, obviously addicts will abuse the system. Just like with oxycotin, morphine, hydrocodone etc.",32

271,2019-07-12 15:46:10+00:00,"So, as with most other words, μαλακός could exhibit a range of meanings and characteristics in different contexts.

A statement by Dionysius of Halicarnassus illustrates this range — mentioning a certain Aristodemus, who was called μαλακός ""either because when a boy he was effeminate and allowed himself to be used as a woman [εἴθ᾽ ὅτι θηλυδρίας ἐγένετο παῖς ὢν τὰ γυναιξὶν ἁρμόττοντα ἔπασχεν], as some relate, or because he was of a mild nature and slow to anger, as others state"" (*Rom. Antiq*. 7.2.4). So here we have a pretty clear statement of its use for a passively penetrated male, but also one of the rare uses of a *positive* sense for μαλακός.

But yeah, mostly it assumed a highly negative connotation, and could even be used in reference to a sort of fixed characteristic trait and nature.

As far as securing its usage it regard to passive penetration, one other useful place to look here is the semantic overlap between this and Latin *pathicus* (παθικός). Even more unequivocally than a number of Greek sources, this could suggest a male involved in passive penetration; and see other Latin terms sometimes related, like *pedicatus*. There's also, perhaps most famously, the κίναιδος/*cinaedus* — though at various times these are described as being bisexual. One salient point here may be that, to a number of Greek and Roman authors, hyper-sexuality was portrayed as a kind of degenerate effeminacy. So this can explain some of the overlap between μαλακός as one who's just generally effeminate, and one who's involved sexually with males too.

Ptolemy's *Tetrabiblos* connects the μαλακός and παθικός in this regard — in a passage that might also be compared with some of what we find in Romans 1, too. 

Here's the full entry on μαλακός in *BDAG*, by the way:

&gt;pert. to being passive in a same-sex relationship, *effeminate* esp. of *catamites*, of men and boys who are sodomized by other males in such a relationship, opp. ἀρσενοκοίτης (Dionys. Hal. 7, 2, 4; Dio Chrys. 49 [66], 25; Ptolem., Apotel. 3, 15, 10; Vett. Val. 113, 22; Diog. L. 7, 173; PHib 54, 11 [c. 245 b.c.] may have this mng.: a musician called Zenobius ὁ μαλακός [prob. with a sideline, according to Dssm., LO 131, 4—LAE 164, 4]. S. also a Macedon. ins in LDuchesne and CBayet, Mémoire sur une Mission au Mont Athos 1876 no. 66 p. 46; Plautus, Miles 668 cinaedus [Gk. κίναιδος] malacus; cp. the attack on the morality of submissive homoeroticism Aeschin. 1, 188; DCohen, Greece and Rome 23, ’76, 181f) 1 Cor 6:9 (‘male prostitutes’ NRSV is too narrow a rendering; ‘sexual pervert’ REB is too broad)=Pol 5:3.—S. lit. s.v. ἀρσενοκοίτης. B. 1065. DELG. M-M.

As far as μαλακός goes in terms of being a formalized profession, there isn't much/anything to suggest prostitution, AFAIK. In a particularly well-known example, from the 3rd century BCE Greco-Egyptian papyrus P. Hibeh I 54, a certain Zenobius is referred to as μαλακός, here clearly a formalized profession. And there are in fact a [number of Greco-Egyptian papyri](https://eugesta-revue.univ-lille3.fr/pdf/2015/6.Sapsford-Eugesta-5_2015.pdf) which refer to μαλακοί in terms of a paid profession — one that, in these contexts, seems to suggest that this referred to a kind of hired *musicians* and performers and/or dancers. (As far as it relates to other uses of the term, perhaps it referred to eunuchs in particular, or to those who danced effeminately. P. Hibeh I 54 is especially valuable in this regard, as it goes on to say that Zenobius was ""wanted by the women for the sacrifice."")",14

The harsh reality of pain induced disabilities is that your capacity is just less, and you need to adjust to your capacity. You can find ways to extend it by trying different things, but the best thing is acceptance. If you can accept your limitations, it's easier to work with them. Focus on what you can do and respect what you can't do. If you keep trying to do everything you did before, you might end up hurting yourself more and reducing your capacity further.

I'm really sorry you're dealing with this too, but I hope you can find a way to manage this and get back to playing!

Vc vai ser desmerecido. Vai falhar em muito que pra outrem é fácil. Só quero, então, te falar pra não complicar nada agora com questões que estão além da capacidade de qualquer indivíduo. A gente é comum. Não precisamos nos supor particularmente indignos. No final, ninguém sente o que sentimos e tá tudo bem assim. Vc não precisa ter aprovação de ninguém. Todos são substituíveis embora não equivalentes. Não há caminho certo, tá todo mundo errado. Não há sentido. Vc não precisa carregar isso tudo nas costas. Sua vida já é difícil por ela mesma. Aguenta, faz algo que goste, estude, trabalhe, se relacione quando convier a todos os envolvidos, só não se queira heroi ou messias ou senhor de nada. Vc é uma pessoa. Pode é sempre ser uma melhor pessoa. No seu próprio critério. E isso basta",3

Neymar, portanto, não estava por perto, no gramado. Logo depois, o telão mostrou[ João Gilberto](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/07/morre-joao-gilberto-lenda-da-bossa-nova-aos-88-anos.shtml), e o Maracanã disse ""chega de saudade."" A seleção em campo na sua velha casa, depois de seis anos de ausência, foi um brinde ao futebol.

 Muito mais do que a[ apresentação](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/07/brasil-vence-peru-e-conquista-copa-america-no-maracana.shtml) do time de Tite, que começou com divórcio entre defesa e ataque, o que permitiu aos peruanos duas finalizações em dez minutos.

 Havia melhorado com a troca de passes insistente e aproximação do meio de campo, quando Gabriel Jesus recebeu pela direita, sem apoio, sem opção de passe e contra três marcadores. Tudo para dar errado, mas o drible saiu perfeito e o cruzamento mais ainda. Everton marcou 1 a 0.

 E, então, o primeiro tempo arrastou-se, como se fosse o famoso jogo de 1957, da folha seca de [Didi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/07/craque-no-brasil-e-heroi-no-peru-didi-morreu-sem-treinar-selecao.shtml). A única chance foi de Firmino num cruzamento de Alex Sandro, antes de o Brasil voltar a chamar a seleção peruana para perto de sua grande área.

 Nunca faltou habilidade aos peruanos. Nem nos tempos dos pontas Seminario e Joya, na década de 1950, nem com Cubillas, nos anos 1970, nem com Carillo e Edinson Flores, na geração atual. Permitir que entrassem driblando era arriscar. Thiago Silva colocou o braço na bola e Guerrero empatou de pênalti.

 Houve a frieza que [Tite](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/07/tite-poe-a-prova-credito-e-aposta-em-veteranos-na-copa-america.shtml) sempre cobrou. Que a equipe não deixasse de usar seu estilo. Trocar passes.

 Assim como a seleção esperou até a semifinal pelo gol de Gabriel Jesus, aguardou até a finalíssima pelo primeiro passe decisivo de Arthur. Foi quem serviu o camisa 9, para deixar a vantagem aos 46 da etapa inicial.

 Mas o Brasil não jogou bem. Não teve a mesma segurança para sair da defesa pelo chão, entregou passes fáceis com Alex Sandro e Alisson, deu um festival de passes errados no segundo tempo. Apesar de ter 57% de posse de bola, houve momentos em que a única alternativa era o contra-ataque. Piorou depois da expulsão de Gabriel Jesus, no minuto 70.

 Alguma estabilidade houve depois da saída de Coutinho, com Militão deslocando Daniel Alves para o meio de campo com duas linhas de quatro.

 A atuação contra o Peru foi arrastada. O título é importante. Mas só vale o discurso de que finais são para ganhar, não para jogar, levando em conta que a Copa América seja uma etapa do trabalho até o Catar. Das seis atuações, a mais valiosa foi contra a Argentina, pela dificuldade imposta pelo rival. Na decisão, o valor foi a partida ser decidida por três meninos. Gabriel Jesus, 22 anos, deu o passe do primeiro gol para Everton Cebolinha, 23. Arthur, 22, deu seu primeiro passe para gol. Richarlison, 22, cobrou o pênalti e fez o gol do título com a frieza de um veterano.

 Os garotos ganharam uma final guerreada. Cria casca, ajuda a dar maturidade a quem poderá ser mais do que apenas coadjuvante. Vencer com eles e [sem ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/06/apos-lesao-em-amistoso-da-selecao-neymar-e-cortado-da-copa-america.shtml)[Neymar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/06/apos-lesao-em-amistoso-da-selecao-neymar-e-cortado-da-copa-america.shtml) permite imaginar que, em alguns anos, pode haver um outro protagonista. O Brasil nunca foi refém de um único craque. Para cumprir as próximas etapas e ser campeão do mundo --o que interessa, afinal-- é preciso ver nascer outra estrela. Apesar da expulsão, quem se comportou como gente grande nas finais foi Gabriel Jesus.

 **AS CAMPEÃS**

 A distância do [futebol feminino dos EUA](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/07/eua-batem-holanda-e-ampliam-supremacia-na-copa-feminina.shtml) diminui, e a Holanda mostrou isso num primeiro tempo equilibrado. Mas as americanas tiram da quantidade a qualidade, e da diversidade, talentos como o de Rapinoe, grande personagem da Copa. O Brasil precisa se organizar para não ficar fora da festa.

 **OS PROBLEMAS**

 O Corinthians perdeu amistoso para o Londrina e preocupa mais depois da parada do que preocupava antes. Carille diz que sua equipe não tem característica de atacar e nem sequer deu entrevista após 2ª derrota em 3 amistosos. Não é só a falta de vocação ofensiva. A defesa precisa voltar a ser segura.",1

Morphine is more sedating compared to oxy and takes longer to come on, at least for me. Once you get a good dose in your system though you're flying. At 1 point I was getting the green 200mg MS Contins and the Roxonol. I was up to about 600mg of the liquid a day at 1 point. Mixing about 400-600 mg with a Fruitopia and head off to work.

Intercept lançando os vazamentos em parcelas é muito mais um estratégia capitalista do que política, ele querem inscritos e assinantes, assim como qualquer serviço. E se eles lançassem tudo de uma vez, hoje a historia já estaria esquecida num monte de memes, contra inteligência e fake news.  


Mesmo mais de um mês depois ainda estamos discutindo a noticia, Greenwald é estratégico nesse modo de lançar as mensagens em pedaços, porque dessa forma, fakes ficam mais difíceis de serem produzidos por quem quer a historia abafada.  


A única contra narrativa que se mantém é a de hackers, que embora duvidosa e implausível se mantém como uma defesa ética contra a noticia. Mesmo que, mesmo que verdadeira, apenas cria argumento contra a forma que tiveram acesso e não ao conteúdo da mensagem (algo que até Moro defendeu nos vazamentos dos áudios de Lula e Dilma)  


Sobre os erros editorias, aqui do lado que apoia Glenn, houveram MUITAS críticas a eles, e estamos pedindo pra que haja mais cautela, uma vez que não queremos um super heroi em Gleen, mas sim um trabalho sério e bem feito. Fica uma indireta aqui.  


E nenhum desses erros está perto de ser uma ""prova"" forjada como a narrativa de registro de bitcoin entregue pelo Pavão, uma vez que bitcoin não deixa registro além do BlockChain, que por ser livre pode ser e foi analisado evidenciando que a transferência é mentira.  


E entre o Pavão e Glenn, existe a densa diferença de que Glenn está mostrando seu rosto e nome, botando sua credibilidade em cheque e até sua segurança. Portando, mentir seria uma coisa muito burra. Já o Pavão se esconde no anonimato.  


Sobre a Veja e Globo de esquerda, é engraçado, no espectro da esquerda política esses dois veículos são considerados de direita. A veja é irrefutável, uma vez que segurou a narrativa anti petista durante anos.  


A Globo trabalha pela Globo, fica do lado ganhador pra garantir seu monopólio. Moro está caindo, logo ela vai mudar a narrativa.  


O pavão só é eficaz porque é muito difícil aceitar que Moro não é o super homem que muitos querem acreditar, então suas narrativas encaixam como uma luva nos buracos lógicos criados no muro de fanatismo pela figura o ex juiz.  


Sinceramente, ir contra Moro não é ir contra a Lava Jato, mas sim ir em prol dela, precisamos de seriedade e que todos os lados sejam postos no olhar da justiça. Eu nunca gritei Lula Livre em um protesto, e olha que fui em muitos como o #EleNão, e quando o clamor pela liberdade do ex presidente era cantado, me mantinha calado, porque eu acreditava que o processo havia sido justo, e que Lula, mesmo com lucro pífio de um apartamento meio ao ""Maior roubo da história"" era culpado de corrupção.  


Vendo a orquestra arranjada para sua prisão, hoje peço por sua liberdade para que ele seja julgado de maneira séria e imparcial justa nos mesmos direitos que eu espero que sejam dados a mim no caso de um processo, e que sei que você também espera pra você.  


Eu apoio a Lava Jato, tanto que quero vela limpa de juiz estrelinha e corruptível, uma Lava Jato que investigue o governo anterior, o provisório e o atual.  


Um país livre de corrupção é um país cuja própria luta contra corrupção seja colocada em vigília para não se corromper.",1

For criminals, yes. It was a very long time. For consumers, it lasted about six months. By that time tens of thousands of doctors and pharmacists had licenses to dispense alcohol. By then the vineyard owners had started selling ""wine bricks"" with extensive warnings about exactly what not to do to turn them into wine. By then the bootleggers had set up shop. 

In October of 1930, a prominent bootlegger who had been running liquor for ten years came forward and broke the whole thing wide open. He talked about how prevalent it was in Congress. By then it was just a matter of deciding if they should repeal it on a state by state basis or do it at the federal level. Franklin D. Roosevelt won his first term as President on a promise to repeal it.

&gt; And besides, it's a war worth fighting.

By what possible metric? That's not a rhetorical question, even though you're probably not sure how to answer it. They don't cover that in the pamphlets. 

All prohibition amounts to is abstinence education. A system which has been proven not to work every single time it's been tried. When people hear ""try heroin and you'll die"" and they don't die, they know they've been lied to. They assume the rest of it is lies. They have no useful information to rely on when they end up getting into it. And it happens. Hundreds of thousands of people abuse heroin. Millions abuse other opiates. Almost none of them know what they're doing.

And the primary cause of overdose deaths is not knowing what you're taking. The rate of overdose deaths from prescription opioids is 6.1 per 100,000 for men. And it's significantly higher among the eldery (65+) and that's because they forget they've taken a pill and take another one, so that skews the numbers. 

The overdose death rate for heroin among males aged 25-44 was 14.8 per 100,000. And that's because they have no idea what they're taking. A person who's been in prison for three months gets out and decides to go back to using. They know they need less than they used to take but they have no idea how to take that dose. And people who have been using regularly for a long time end up with a packet of fetanyl that kills them. And that doesn't even consider the other drugs that get mixed in with ""heroin"" on the street to dilute the product for more profits. It could be anything from aspirin to someone's heart medication.

&gt; The world was turning, but life was a lot more rough than it was now.

Was that because of the opium? 

As late as 1925 a man was put on trial for teaching human evolution. Even today, evolution is a controversial topic. Is it because the science is incomplete? Or is it because religious people don't want their kids to learn science?

Doctors thought it was my appendix at first so they took that out, then it took about 3 days for them to realize I wasnt getting better so they sent me into emergency surgery. I had over 2 liters of puss in my body cavity and had my diverticulum removed. Afterwards I was on a ventilator for 3 days (I dont remember a single moment of that thank god). Then it was a hell of a road or recovery, as well as having to deal with some abceses and an adhesion.

347,2019-07-06 15:18:58+00:00,"I think just about anyone who wants heroin can find it anyway. And if they can't find diamorphone they can certainly find other kind of opiates. But with our current system, instead of a cashier who is required to check ID we have people who are specifically targeting kids to work for them because of the reduced sentences for minors. 

And people try pot and reailze it's nowhere near as bad as DARE told them it was. So they assume they're lying about all the other drugs. It's hard to say anything about addiction without it coming across as a political statement because the war on (some) drugs has been politicized for decades.

So we give them the truth. Heroin is amazing. It's like no natural feeling in the world. And it will wreck your shit. No one can control it, no one can contain it, because it's not a matter of will or strength of character. It's a matter of physiology. But it's a lie to say there's no such thing as a functional heroin addict. Just like any drug, there are those who can be productive even as everything else falls apart. Those people don't deserve jail. They don't need cops peeking through their windows. They need help.

And the people who do drugs and go wild, they go to jail. But it's not the 'doing drugs' part of it, it's the going wild.

349,2019-07-06 06:37:59+00:00,"Vezi tu, e o chestie acolo implicata, care se numeste dependenta psihica. Asta presupune ca exista o situatie sa ii spunem foarte stresanta, care ii cauzeaza foarte mult disconfort stresatului. Stresatul cauta scaparea din realitate, hopa! o tuiculita, o liniuta, niste Krokodyl. Fineturi, dupa posibilitati.


Aici apar cateva puncte de vedere cel putin interesante. 

1. Cum a ajuns persoana aia in situatia respectiva? Pot fi multe cauze: ai pierdut serviciu, ti-au murit parintii, copiii, familia, te-ai nascut intr-o alta etnie discriminata, etc. Legat de aceasta intrebare, o chestiune este certa: viciile sunt de multe, multe feluri. Anul acesta, spre exemplu, urmeaza sa fie inclusa dependenta de jocuri video in ghidurile internationale de diagnostice psihologice. Ah, si ca, mare atentie, omul care e slab e cel care poate fi viciat. Dar toti suntem slabi, pentru ca nu e nimeni perfect. Celelalte concluzii le tragem la restul intrebarilor, ca sa fie cu suspans :D

2. De unde procura dependentul substanta ce ii asigura linistea interioara? Pai, sunt multe variante: alcoolul si jocurile video sunt super usor de gasit, doar ca pt alcool ai nevoie de bani, iar la jocuri video, de calculator si plata curentului/netului. Poporul roman are traditie de a-si face singuri alcoolul, asa ca, na, preturi acceptabile. Carciumarii mai dau de baut si pe caiet, trebuie sa mai aiba cineva un ban in familia aia, daca nu, cersit si prostitutie. La furat? Bun, dar daca narcoticul este mai greu de procurat? Heroina cat era pe gram, aprox 200 de lei? Zilnic? Acolo clar se va vedea, garantat, trecerea spre ilegalitate. Cersetoria si prostitutia in formele initiale, proxenetism, talharie, jaf, violenta fizica dupa. Deja aici vorbim despre intretinerea unui cerc vicios de violente: oameni care ajung in detentie, in plina dependenta de narcotice dure, nu prea am vazut sa existe ceva psihoterapie, consiliere, centre de dezintoxicare prin penitenciare. Ceea ce ii condamna pe oameni la repetarea cercului vicios la iesire: iar fura pentru bani. Pai, si atunci, care e faza, ce putem face?

3. Ce putem face, totusi? Ei, aici sunt mai multe aspecte. In avans, am sa vreau sa discut, de aici incolo, numai despre drogurile ilegale; la alcool e mai complicat putin si nu m-as pripi. Revenind: cel mai important lucru de inteles e ca, in sine, problema este una de ordin social. Oamenii recunoscuti ca dependenti sunt ocoliti de societate, tocmai pentru ca se afla la marginea unei sfere de mari ilegalitati. Ori daca noi, ca oameni, am incerca sa ii ajutam, nu sa mergem noi, ci sa sustinem ONGuri care fac asta, poate ar fi o sansa in plus. Dupa care, cam cati sunt dispusi sa angajeze fosti puscariasi? Da, inteleg, e un bias cognitiv la mijloc, dar poate ca ar trebui sa gasim o metoda prin care sa trecem peste asta. Am epuizat solutiile astea si am inteles ca e o problema sociala?

4. Legalizarea consumului si vanzarii, crearea de organe competente pentru verificari periodice si decriminalizarea consumului. Ehe, aici vine partea faina, unde vin cu exemplu concret. Portugalia, in mijlocul anilor 90, a avut probleme foarte mari cu dependenta de narcotice dure. Prin 2000, au schimbat foaia si au schimbat abordarea si, mergand pe firul legalizarii, decriminalizarii, au observat ca, incet incet, problemele descrise la punctul 3 au disparut. Ce alte avantaje ar putea aduce? Oho: nu mai ajung narcomani la inchisoare, lipsa cazierului patat, posibilitatea de a munci, in timp ce ar avea unde face consilierea necesara (ce ziceam mai devreme la ONG). Mai mult decat atat, e posibil sa se stopeze chiar o parte din celelalte crime facute, care i-ar fi dus in inchisoare (jaf, talharie, prostitutie). Odata cu legalizarea, acolo vine clar cu impozitare si reglementare, ceea ce inseamna ca sunt sanse mari ca asigurarea medicala obligatorie sa ajunga sa fie platita de fix impozitele lor. Sau macar o parte, cred eu peste jumatate.

Si, in final, 5. Factorul cheie este cel social, cel de excluziune sociala. Cei dependenti ar vedea ca nu traiesc intr-o lume in care sunt exclusi si neluati in seama. Asta, in sine, daca este reparata, are sanse foarte mari sa afecteze in mod pozitiv viata tuturor, sa stim ca exista mecanisme bine structurate care sa ne ajute in caz de impas.",2

 Em duas de suas obras, [Freud conta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/03/unidos-pelo-inconsciente-freud-e-jung-acabaram-separados-pelo-sexo.shtml) uma história deliciosa para ilustrar o quanto e como a contradição habita o inconsciente. Um cidadão se queixa de que emprestou um caldeirão ao vizinho, que o devolveu furado. Investigado e inquirido, o vizinho respondeu: 1) ele não me emprestou caldeirão algum; 2) eu o devolvi intacto; 3) o caldeirão já veio furado. 

 As respostas do ex-juiz e ministro da Justiça, Sergio Moro, aos que criticam a atuação [dele e do procurador Deltan ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/leia-integra-da-troca-de-mensagens-entre-moro-e-deltan-ante-tensao-com-stf.shtml)[Dallagnol](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/leia-integra-da-troca-de-mensagens-entre-moro-e-deltan-ante-tensao-com-stf.shtml), postas à luz pelas revelações [do site The Intercept Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/07/ccj-do-senado-convocara-glenn-greenwald-para-falar-sobre-vazamento-de-mensagens.shtml), são de um teor comparável. Moro respondeu: 1) as informações podem ter sido adulteradas; 2) elas não contêm nada demais. E acrescenta que a eventual adulteração talvez tenha sido parcial. 

 Sem dúvida, os defensores do midiático ex-juiz dirão que a comparação não procede. No caso do [personagem de Freud](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/01/como-o-mal-estar-na-identidade-masculina-molda-a-politica-dos-nossos-tempos.shtml), as respostas se contradizem. Se não houve nenhum empréstimo, o caldeirão não poderia ter sido devolvido, nem o vizinho saberia que ele já veio furado. E se ele já veio furado, não poderia ter sido devolvido intacto.

 Já no caso de Moro, diriam: as informações podem ser eventualmente falsas (em parte ou na totalidade) e, além disso, não conter nada de escandaloso.

 Respondo: em termos da lógica, entendida no sentido teórico mais estrito, é assim mesmo. As respostas de Moro são compatíveis. Porém no registro de uma lógica pragmática, elas são contraditórias, e esse registro é essencial, tanto mais em se tratando de questões políticas. 

 A diferença entre a lógica teórica, em sentido estrito, e a pragmática não é difícil de exemplificar. Se digo que não sou capaz de improvisar um discurso em chinês, essa frase, em termos estritamente lógicos, é verdadeira. Mas em termos pragmáticos, ela é falsa. Por quê? Porque se, de fato, eu não sou capaz de improvisar um discurso em chinês, também não sou capaz de fazer menos do que isso em chinês, como ler um discurso ou mesmo entender algumas palavras. 

 Ora, a frase sugere o contrário. Faz supor que, embora eu não possa improvisar um discurso em chinês, eu seria capaz de fazer alguma coisa mais modesta, sem dúvida, no registro daquela língua. 

 Existe aí um “halo lógico-pragmático”, que é inseparável da frase. Como ele enfoca uma afirmação não verdadeira, a frase é pragmaticamente falsa. Com o discurso do ex-magistrado, acontece coisa análoga. 

 Nos dois casos, temos o efeito dos “halos lógico-pragmáticos”. Só que, em um deles, o halo recobre uma afirmação falsa e, no outro caso, o halo é de negações que induzem a falsidade pragmática do conjunto dos enunciados. Porém, em ambos, existe um campo mal iluminado de frases implícitas, que produzem um efeito de ilusão.

 Como já disse, em sentido estritamente lógico, as respostas de Moro podem ser todas verdadeiras. O material divulgado pelo Intercept teria sido eventualmente adulterado (total ou parcialmente) e, ao mesmo tempo, não traria nada de mais. Em termos pragmáticos, entretanto, um dos enunciados põe em xeque o outro, o que significa que eles acabam se falseando mutualmente.

 De fato, se as gravações são eventualmente falsas, por que dizer que nelas não há nada de chocante ou escandaloso? Verdadeira ou não, essa segunda afirmação, que pretende funcionar como um reforço da primeira tira, na realidade, a força dessa e, no limite, a anula. Inversamente, se não há nada de mais nas revelações, por que dizer que são eventualmente falsas? 

 Verdadeiro ou não, o segundo enunciado cria, de novo, um problema. A imputação da eventual falsidade das gravações retira a força da afirmação de que não há lá motivo de escândalo e, no limite, a anula. Restaria talvez a sub-hipótese de que elas sejam “em parte“ eventualmente falsas, em parte verdadeiras.

 Essa sub-resposta é a “colagem” das duas principais, a tentativa de conciliar afirmações pragmaticamente incompatíveis. Ela seria aceitável?

 Observe-se, primeiro, que essa solução —que constitui, na realidade, uma terceira resposta— não é a última das teses propostas. Moro disse ainda que houve “descuido“ ao transmitir informalmente o que teria de ser objeto de uma transmissão formal. E mais: afirmou também e principalmente que “não se lembra”. Ó santa amnésia, mãe dos mentirosos.

 Vê-se que não se pode acusar Moro de não nos ter dado uma resposta —são pelo menos cinco. A tese mais complexa, a de que as revelações sejam em parte verdadeiras, em parte eventualmente falsas, o obrigaria a dizer o que há lá de verdadeiro e o que há de eventualmente falso.

 Ele deveria ter dito, por exemplo: “Eu jamais instruí o procurador Dallagnol a não enviar supostas revelações sobre certo político que poderia ser um aliado precioso”. Ou: “Eu jamais sugeri que se ouvisse certa testemunha”. 

 Ora, Moro não disse precisamente isso. O que sugeriu é um axioma de ordem geral: lá onde as gravações revelam procedimentos juridicamente ilegítimos, é que se trata de passagens eventualmente falsificadas; lá onde as conversas não contêm nada de legalmente ou moralmente imputável, elas são autênticas.

 Com esse algoritmo sofístico, ele ganha sempre a partida. Use o procedimento 1 se for possível. Se não for, use o 2. Se não der o 2, tem o 3. O caldeirão nunca foi emprestado. Voltou intacto. Já estava furado. Esse jogo de respostas é uma confissão de culpa. Moro sofisma e mente como respira. Ele ganha sempre nos dados porque os dados estão viciados. 

 Moro é um justiceiro que teve o destino de todos os justiceiros. Desandou. Em nome da “justiça”, definida pelo seu ilibado senso moral, ele e seu bando praticaram toda a sorte de irregularidades e ilegalidades: interceptação ilícita de conversas telefônicas, interferência no trabalho dos procuradores (para usar um eufemismo), deposição “sob vara” lá onde a lei não pedia, decretação de prisões preventivas sem justificativa (uma delas resultou em suicídio de um professor universitário).

 Diz-se, com razão, que Moro e os seus seguem o velho e mortífero adágio de que os fins justificam os meios. Mas é preciso se debruçar sobre o sentido específico do caso.

 Digamos que Moro e seus amigos teriam partido de uma causa justa: combater a corrupção, doença endêmica —mas não a única— da política brasileira (hoje já não se tem certeza de que o ponto de partida do herói tenha sido esse, mas pode ter sido). O bravo juiz se dispôs a utilizar todos os meios, legais e ilegais, para atingir os seus objetivos.

 Houve uma corrida de obstáculos em direção ao reino da “justiça”. Observe-se que os obstáculos, no caso, são nada menos do que as leis do país, que os justiceiros-velocistas aprenderam a pular.

 Como resultado, Moro ajudou a eleger um governo —do qual logo se transformou, sem a menor vergonha, em ministro da Justiça— que não apenas herdou o hábito da corrupção que sempre caracterizou a política brasileira (ou se deve supor que o desvio de salários de representantes eleitos é coisa sem importância?), mas que também acumula com isso ligações “estranhas” com as milícias e que pratica a política mais retrógrada, mais medíocre, mais intolerante que já se viu no país. 

 Pior do que isso, trata-se de um governo autocrático, para dizer o menos, já que seu objetivo, suficientemente explícito, é acabar com os poderes “intermediários”, isto é, o Congresso, a mídia independente, e também a universidade.

 Essa foi a contribuição que o justiceiro deu ao seu país. Ele passará para a história como um dos parteiros desse monstro político que é o governo Bolsonaro, um governo que nomeia ministros a partir dos sábios conselhos de [uma estrela do norte que brilha na Virgínia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2018/11/unica-coisa-rigorosa-no-discurso-de-olavo-sao-os-palavroes-diz-ruy-fausto.shtml).

The slow metabolism of Buprenorphine gives your body more time to adapt to decreasing exogenic (substance-induced) mu-OpioidReceptor-Agonism (because the amount of mu-agonism caused by Buprenorphine slowly decreases) and therefore has your body already adapted to some extent of decreased, substance-induced mu-agonism once the long-acting opioid leave your body but you still got to prepare to deal with the (lessened) acute opioid-withdrawal-syndrome at the- and after your short taper.

Small reminder: A withdrawal of long-acting opioids can produce 1-2 months acute withdrawal (as opposed to 5-10 days for short-acting opioids such as Oxycodone or Heroin/ Diamorphin) so really keep it at a shortterm taper as using it longer is only making sense if the long-acting opioid is going to be used for years.

So keeping all that in mind should you use the absolute bare minimume of what you can take to enable you to push through some of the acute withdrawal syndrome but you can not take all your symptoms away (using Buprenorphine/Suboxone) and still expect to lessen your physical dependency.

I citied the same exact article that you cited...... you just are only posting parts of it to make your argument valid. 

A $55 kickback was awesome to the doctors at the time. Then the government stepped in because we have an opioid crisis. So what are the doctors going to do now? Keep prescribing pain pills for $55 and rick losing their ability to practice, or start using these Brand New!!!! injections created by the same people who made the pain pills in the first place. Why would they settle with $55 dollars per pain pill script, when opioid manufacturers have miraculously created a CURE!!!! they can shoot up in their patients for 1K a pop.

362,2019-07-05 18:29:19+00:00,"I can’t speak to the effectiveness of ketamine treatments, but I can speak from a place of experience when it comes to the supplements you’re taking - especially Kratom.

Kratom is an opioid with a novel pathway unlike typical prescription pain killers. It stimulates mu opioid receptors and is addicting. Be very wary of the echo chambers like r/Kratom that claim stopping Kratom cold turkey is like caffeine withdrawals - it’s not. It’s like withdrawing from oxycotin, Valium and an antidepressant at the same time.

Kratom really does help provide energy and mood lift, but these are temporary and artificial. I highly recommend you taper off Kratom - in fact you may find you feel better without it since long term use of Kratom can cause anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure).

Sorry if this comment seems critical, but I’ve been where you’ve been and it took years for me to dig myself out of the hole Kratom threw me into. Don’t want to see anyone else suffer like that.",5

According to Josephus, under the procurator Fadus (44-46) a messianic prophet appeared named Theudas. He convinced many Jews he could part the Jordan River. (Antiq. 20.97-99, Acts 5:36)
I’m not sure it qualifies, but Judas the Galilean lead a tax-revolt about A.D. 6, described by Josephus (Antiq 18.1.6, §23). Like Theudas, he died and his followers dispersed.

Another messianic pretender, known only as “The Egyptian” led a crowd in an attack on Jerusalem. Josephus reports 30,000 were in the crowd, but Acts 21:38 indicates only 4000 were involved. The Romans arrested many, but the Egyptian escaped. (JW 2.13.5, Acts 21:38).

Simon Bar Giora (Simon, son of the proselyte; died in A.D. 70). Simon represents the largest of the messianic movements (Josephus, JW, 4.9.3).  He fought against the Romans and helped unite the Zealots to a certain extent.  He eventually controlled Jerusalem, and took to wearing a white tunic and purple cape and called himself the “King of the Jews.”  He eventually surrendered to the Romans and was taken to Rome and ceremonially executed.

There are others, bar Jesus, Elymas the sorcerer, Simon Magus, Dositheos the Samaritan, etc.

383,2019-07-04 17:17:28+00:00,"No, they were sealed because the defendant didn't want any of the details emerging from court filings and like many courts the judge just went ahead and required everything to be filed under seal without regard for the law on sealing records. I would bet my own money on it given my experience with defendants demanding everything be sealed because it's damaging to them and the courts not wanting to take the effort to know and accurately apply the law. The minor issue was the justification after the fact. It's not hard to use pseudonyms and reacting other identifying information. But it is easier for the court to ignore the law on sealing records and just make everything be filed under seal. 

It's laziness by the court combined with a defendant who doesn't want bad information accessible to the public. This happens daily with many companies who demand confidentiality orders not because of any trade secrets, but because they don't want the public knowing about what they did.

The most recent example of this is the oxycotin suits. The damaging effects of the drug were well known not only to manufacturers but also the courts of West Virginia. However, the judge handling those cases just sealed everything at the behest of the defendants without regard for the law. This allowed the manufacturers to keep the damaging information hidden for decades, all because of abuse of the sealing process in court. It's also happened with vehicle manufacturers and a host of other industries.

Point is, there's little justification for sealing and a wealth in opposition to it. The seal wasn't put in place here to protect the minors, it was put in place to keep the defendants actions from being available to the public.",8

At least then someone who asks for 200ng of Fentanyl actually knows what they're taking, and someone who thinks they're buying much safer heroin or morphine actually gets what they ordered, instead of something cut with fenanyl to up the dealer's profit margin. 

Not to mention - a legal supply would cut the prices enormously, with significant reductions in property crime. You know how addicts afford a $200+/day habit? It's not day-trading on the stock market. 

Studies have shown that addicts who can easily get a hold of the drugs they're addicted to have a much better chance of getting away from street life and maybe making something of their lives.

I don't really like the haze, not always, (sometimes I do, sometimes it helps me laugh when really depressed for always being sick) and I certainly dislike the smell. I've never tried to vape it, and I'm really stuck to smoking it. Lost the tobacco though, since 2007, at least I did that. 

And my lungs are not happy with the smoking either. I did try eating it instead, but I find it harder to dose, and it takes SO long to work, when smoking it is instant relief. 

There are positives and negatives to the use of weed. 

I've never heard of kratom though.  And i still need to get rid of the last 10mg of prednisone. YEARS it's taking me! I find prednisone more of a harddrug than anything else I've encountered. (and I didn't encounter any real harddrugs) Even worse than the opiate painkillers like tramadol.

This is my personal point of view. Disclaimer. 

It’s absolutely horrible 
what the Fake Opioid Crisis is doing to stereotype, fear and judge actual chronic sufferers. 

It’s destroying lives because people who have been forced to use them to function in society due to desperate pain relief; Are being cold turkey taken off them after 6-20 years because doctors are scared into it because if any patient is hospitalized they are put under a microscope. 

The people who are dying from Opioid overdoses are typically a teenager who stole left over pain pills from moms surgery etc. 

95% of all others almost always a victim of their dealer lacing their recreational drugs with fentonyl which is very easy and cheap to make. 
Others are actually patients who have run out, become addicted and are not tolerant to opioids and get a bottle of pills on the street and it’s always “just that one “ pill that has 100 times the dose. 

Other doctors or really anyone now that is made aware of it are just shocked and they all have a 100 questions and I’m sick of it, it is between me and my family doctor. 

The hysteria has gotten to seeing my clients who have mentioned that they take them are judged harshly; losing jobs, family, and entire careers because of this. Babysitters are no longer trusted with kids, daycare providers and actual addiction counselors like myself, are questioned and second guessed. 

I absolutely would not be living today without after trying everything; surgeries, 40 different medications and finally there was no other choice. The Opioids only barely take away the pain and it is a daily battle to cope. 

I do know that these drugs were only used for end of life situations in the past and am not lost on the fact that down ones life, yes, you may not get pain relief from surgery, traumatic illness or injury and dying. Ask anyone about that and they will absolutely say they would rather have a life now while they can actually make a contribution to society. 

I do believe in close medication monitoring because it prevents most people from becoming addicts, or drug dealers themselves. I have seen Lawyers, Doctors, uncles etc Because it effects all of us in some way down the line. 

In closing, I strongly advise any chronic pain sufferers to not divulge anything about your chronic pain management to anyone",3

435,2019-07-01 10:40:25+00:00,"Okay well lets just say it or break it down like this...  


If you have never done any form of opiate before... Sure they are practically the same thing..

&amp;#x200B;

They are both Downers, Both Pain Killers, ones made in a clean lab and tested for purity and quantity per dose, so lets just say yeah.. They are the same just Oxy is a lot cleaner and safer because its made in a scientific lab vs some Drug Lab set up Mexico or South American somewhere.. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, to those of us who are experienced drug / opiate users..   No they are similar in the slightest!  


You see Oxycodone or Oxycontin which is just the time release version of Oxycodone) is extracted from Thebain as opposed to Morphine like Heroin is extracted from..   


However, yes, both Oxycodone and Heroin are very similar and both fall under the category of being a Semi Synthetic opiates, just one is made from Thebain and the other is made from Morphine.    


So there is a slight difference..  


Like me personally i prefer a Thebain based pain killer, such as Oxycodone, Percocet, and Vicodin.  I think the high feels a lot better and is a lot more energizing and lovey dovey feeling with that warmth you get in your stomach when taking one of those, as opposed to that floaty, noddy, cloud like high you feel when taking Morphine, Heroin, or Fetanyl.    


They are both considered Semi Synthetic Opioids, so yeah they are extremely similar, but yeah overall they are completely different..  


If that makes since to you all ha ha  


Sorry if it didn't!  
Here's a little fun fact: 

In 1992 something went down where the cartels made an agreement where they would divide the Heroine Supply up by two different parts of the united states.  They agreed upon the fact that everything east of the Mississippi River so Florida, New York, Mass, etc.. Would be getting their dope supply from Columbia and everything West of the Mississippi Would come from Mexico...  


This is why when you are in states like California, Arizona, Oregon, etc.. When you go to the D boys house your most likely going to get a bag of that Mexican Mud or Black Tar Heroine.  And then when your in States like Florida or New York, when you place an order for a bag of dope you'll most likely get the powder or as I like to call it the Afghan Sand type Heroin / Dope.  I like both.. but this is the reason for the divide, and for the most part its true.. Occasionally I will run into the other kind on each coast (since I've lived on both) but for the most part east coast is always powder and west coast is usually always tar..

437,2019-07-01 05:20:15+00:00,"Sorry this is long. I grew up on the border (El Paso/Juarez). Let me see if I can help you with some real-life advice:

\--I've never crossed the border by land. I don't know what to expect at the border crossing, and what the Border Patrol may be searching for.

Don't cross in a car. At least in Juarez, they like to pull white people over and give them bullshit tickets or arrest you because they think you have money. And the traffic laws are very different in Mexico. We would always park near the border, walk over using one of the international bridges, and then just bring stuff back in our bags/purses. And it's cheaper to cross by foot. And I guarantee most, if not all, Mexican border towns have a ""main drag"" with pharmacies (Farmacia) and bars and stores and dry goods and restaurants right there as you cross into Mexico. You won't have to go far into Mexico to find the medication. Keep tight hold of your purse.

At the border going over to Mexico, they don't ask a lot. Getting back into the US is a pain, but generally it's just long lines and answering a few questions:

Nationality? American  
What were you doing over there? Shopping/touristy stuff  
Do you have anything to declare? No, sir.  
They may ask to search your bag. Honestly, if they find the medication, just tell them it's for personal use. I used to buy my BC pills by the year over there because they were $5 a month instead of $50. 15 years ago, the CBP cared only about liquor, illegal drugs, and fruit.

\--I don't speak Spanish. How the hell am I supposed to do something like buying medicine at a Mexican pharmacy? Since I'm heading for a town literally on the border, I'm guessing that there will be a lot of bilingual folks. But depending on English-speakers to be in my vicinity seems like a terrible idea.

Someone gave you an excellent Spanish primer in another comment--it's enough to get by on the border.

\--This is, y'know, drug-smuggling, right? This could go horribly wrong, and that's pretty intimidating. I should make a better plan than just ""lol gonna make a weekend trip to Mexico.""

I don't think it's considered drug smuggling. Those pills are not a controlled but legal substance in the US (like Xanax or Perocet) so I don't think you'd be breaking any laws. I used to buy 12 packs of BC pills at a time.

So, I thought I should ask you folks for your opinion. Do you think this is a good idea? If so, how should I prepare and plan for this trip?

I do think this is a good idea. The medication is likely to be much less expensive in Mexico, and my guess is you probably don't need a prescription or have a limit on how much you can buy and bring to the US. And it would be cheaper to mail through the US post than get it shipped in from another country. Thank you for thinking abut doing this.

One important thing to plan for, in case you run into any trouble: bribing the police (or Federales) to get out of minor scrapes is perfectly acceptable. You should bring about $100 and put it in your sock in case you run into problems with the police in Mexico. They're greedy, so don't whip all of it out at once. Act like they're really taking everything you have from your wallet. If they still aren't happy, then you can break into your bribe money in your sock. (I've never had this problem, because we always kept our heads down.) Also, keep yourself alert. You are not in America, and it has been common for rich-looking people to be kidnaped and then ransomed for money. Make sure someone knows where you're going and when you plan to be back. Go with some friends if possible. For best results, just go over for an afternoon. If you stay close enough to the border, you might even be able to keep cell reception from the US, but don't count on it. You may have international roaming charges if you use your phone.

I've also found some border towns are more ""friendly"" than others. Tijuana was pretty nice, Juarez probably next; I haven't been to any other Mexican border cities. I think these days with the cartels and drug violence, you may want to stay away from Brownsville/Nuevo Laredo. Juarez is still a bit sketchy, and I have no idea how Tijuana is these days--Tijuana may be substantially worse than I remember because of the Sinaloa cartel.

I'm not trying to scare you. Tens of millions of people live in Mexico and have no trouble. I went there all the time before I moved away from El Paso in 2008. My dad went there when he was a teen. It's just a very different country, and you should be aware of the potential pitfalls. Honestly, keep your head down, mind your own business, be polite and respectful, and you'll have no problems.

Happy adventuring!",53

Made sure they talked to my GI doc as well, but my OB had other patients that has AI issues so she knew to keep me on my biologic. She also was willing to work with me on my pain relief with opiates.  At that time I was on fentnyl patches used to bypass my stomach because yes, things went through too fast. It also helped slow down the peristalsis. Alas I don't have a lot of options for pain relief as I cannot have NSAIDs due to crohn's (causes bleeding and flares) and cannot take tylenol due to AI crohn's related liver disease(Primary Sclerosing Colangitis)  I still use opiates if I cannot get the D to stop and I'm bleeding. One dilaudid ususally works within an hour. 

When I was first diagnosed I was in and out of the hospital almost every other weekend. It sucked and was scary as fuck. I mean you have lots of blood coming out of your bum, and that just ain't normal. Not to mention the pain. Alas, all I can send is internet hugs. 

So an idea I just had, ask your GI doc if they can recommend an OB or know of any OB's they have worked with. For me my GI doc is almost my primary doc. Crohn's affects so many systems. I've had pretty much all the stupid 'complications' of crohn's including the arthritis, the eye inflammation. I'm going off track as I'm a bit stoned right now. Not having a great day.
