There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

However I would invite you to reconsider whether black women are really ""oppressed"" by white men.  I'm not saying it never happens, but I feel like the mainstream media can paint a really distorted narrative with regards to this.

While I'm all for equal rights, most aspects of modern society are actually geared towards giving women and black people extra advantages to their male and white counterparts:

- The double standard made between male and female sexual assault victims: whilst the latter is taken seriously, the former is often treated as a joke in both the mainstream liberal media and by wider society (https://forum.malesurvivor.org/threads/victim-blaming-double-standards.73416/)

- Despite what media footage may tell you (an example of the spotlight fallacy), white males are actually the racial demographic that are killed the most by police (https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/07/03/police-black-killings-homicide-rates-race-injustice-column/3235072001/), and indeed most of the cases shown by the media were distorted (contrary to popular belief, Floyd was actually armed when officer Chauvin apprehended him, and the coroner deemed his death to be caused by fentayl, not the precautionary measures taken by officer Chauvin)

- The fact that many men are caused by society (especially by women) to feel uncomfortable expressing emotions. This can take a serious emotional toll and contributes to the higher male suicide rate (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8685245/Suicide-rate-men-reaches-highest-level-two-decades.html)

- The blatant double standards regarding celebration of our identities. Why is it that there is no White Lives Matter, White history month, White panthers? Why is there no ""Meninist"" Majority, UN council for men's rights, men's only college scholarships? Frankly this is one of the reasons why I tend to feel somewhat persecuted as a white male: society sees me as the enemy and constantly tries to discriminate against me (https://www.conservapedia.com/Color_revolution)

I could go on, but I think my point is clear: white men tend to be victimised by society the most by cancel culture, the democrats, BLM thugs, etc (this sounds silly to you I know, but the fact the media says otherwise is part of the unfairness. If you lived in Nazi Germany you might be lead to think Jews control the world, when actually it is anything but the case)",-8
14,2021-02-26 03:00:22+00:00,"(1)If I recall correctly CW admitted to mixing SW Thrive drink with 80 mg of Oxycodone.
(2)Your missing the point. It's the action of giving Oxycodone to SW, Without her permission or knowledge. Thats a crime. It's not the fact that CW gave SW 1 single dose of Oxycodone and that a miscarriage didnt happen. His mindset / intent was to cause a miscarriage, without her knowledge, caused by his actions of dosing her without her knowledge or permission.
(3)A main side effect from pain medication is nausea. SW was probably experiencing side effects from suddenly taking 80 mg of Oxycodone. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and headaches and more. She probably thought it was pregnancy related, which is why she probably didnt seek medical attention. **Also the lifespan of the Oxycodone is probably about 12 hours. So it ""wore off"" and she begain to feel better, then she got better. Making her probably believe again, it was pregnancy related.
(4)So imagine, calling your Dr. Any Dr. And saying ""Hi I'm SW, I'm 3 months pregnant, over the past 12 hours I have felt nauseated, vomited, and I have a bad headache"" - Knowing, What was wrong with SW, was different then What SW should have done. SW didnt know she consumed Oxycodone. SW didnt want to go to ER because of medical benefits/money.
(5)IMO-SW had a headache/""migraine"" due to the Oxycodone. Trying to Rationalize, that it ""made no sense the Oxycodone could of caused a miscarriage"" What if CW was confirming to see if SW got sick from Only 80mg. What if CW intended to overload SW as time went on. A little in her Thrive, some in her cereal, a splash in her milk. No. I think SW recognized the financial circumstances and was waiting to ""feel better"" and I believe she did, due to the lifespan of 1 Oxycodone, Under the belief it was her pregnancy-making the decision to not seek medical. You cant rationalize CW irrationale behavior.
(6)SW stated why she didnt go to the ER. 
(7)Yes. CW is a Dummie.  Its an Opioid. Oxycodone and Oxycotin (both opioids) are about the same except 1 drug last longer / fast acting then the other. Drs. choice depending on diagnosis. SW was given Oxycodone for her neck-Pain

And he's talking to the judge; 

""You see your honor... I had gone with my buddy to Dr. Jason after he busted his knee up at work. Dr. Jason gave him a bunch of medicine and he was tellin everyone how he was doin so much better. And my back had been hurtin for a couple years on and off, so I got seen by Dr. Jay, and he said that my vertibreas was messed up and it was probably causin' me all these problems. I told him I wasn't sleepin good neither, so he gave me the xanex to take during the day and some ambien so I could sleep. And I was doin fine but then a couple months later, I got stopped by the po-leece who said I had stopped at the traffic light for too long...."" 

(""Your honor, the defendant had been unconscious behind the wheel of his vehicle, on video, for nearly sixteen minutes by the time I arrived on scene and made contact with him."")

""And anyway, I didn't know that those pills could mess you up and that you couldn't drive with them because I was just doing what the doctor says so I could work.""

(""Your honor, during the traffic stop, Mr Smith repeatedly stated that he had been unemployed for some time, as he asked me not to write him a ticket because he couldn't afford another one."") 

""I mean, I wouldn't have been taken them pills at all, but the doctor said they was fine and he never told me not to drive or nothin'."" 

(""Your honor- after arriving at the jail, Mr. Smith was read implied consent, and he waived his Miranda Rights. Both on scene at the traffic stop, as well as at the jail, he repeatedly stated that he did not have any illness, injuries or other physical or mental impairments. It was only after I advised him that I'd observed the multiple bottles of pills in the center console of his vehicle that Mr Smith mentioned various illnesses that were the reason he was taking the medications listed on the toxicology report.""

(Hands judge an additional printed page);
""In addition to the prescription medications Mr Smith had on his person that he stated were prescribed for ""back pain"" and ""anxiety"", Mr. Smith also had a .17 BAC, and the results of the blood draw show that he tested positive for opiods (oxycodone, roxycodone, codeine) and benzodiazapines (xanex, halidol,valium and ambien), as well as amphetamine, cocaine, fentynyl &amp; marijuana.

 Finally, during the interview subsequent to his blood draw, Mr Smith clearly stated that he had gone to ""Port Charlotte Pain Clinic"" with multiple friends and relatives in the weeks prior to the traffic stop, specifically to obtain the prescription medications he had on his person. He stated MULTIPLE TIMES that he didn't have any physical or mental disabilities and that he felt he was able to safely operate a motor vehicle.""

""Uh, your honor, I uh... I had never taken nothing until I went to Dr. Jay.  He prescribed all that stuff to my buddies, my girlfriend, my dad and my cousin, so like, he told me that I had this back trouble and I didn't know none of them pills would get you hooked on stuff and could mess you up. This is all that doctors fault. They told me I should take them things and they didn't warn me that stuff could mess you up or nothin'. I got real sick at the jail because they wouldn't even give me none of my meds and stuff back while I was there, and that's when I got into that fight with that dude deputy that I punched, because none of this was my fault- It was all because Dr. Jay said to take them pills.""



Seriously. It was like the NEVER ENDING story; We'd deal with fucking zonked out people who would tell you six ways to Sunday there was nothing wrong with them- yet they'd have purses and pockets FULL of the strongest controlled substances on the market. 

The MOMENT they'd get arrested for DUI or something else drug related- they would insist they INNOCENTLY tripped and fell into whichever pill mill they'd been getting thier stash from- and then BLAME THE DOCTORS who ""tricked them"" into ""getting hooked"". It was to the point that I would always make it a point to ask them all about how they ended up seeing the doctor for thier problems- and it was NEVER a legitimate illness, injury, surgery, etc etc etc- every single time they would say; 

""All my buddies have been going there and said they would write you for anything you wanted. So we got some stuff there to take on the weekends when we party and next thing you know, I was on all these pills every day."" 

It's funny that they could rattle off EVERY prescription they were getting, with the dosages and amounts they were given... But not one person seemed to have an explanation for WHY they had gone to a doctor in the first place beyond ""sometimes my back hurts"" or ""I was having trouble sleeping"". 



Yet here we are - a dozen years later - and people are out here with spinal fusions and brain surgeries and fucking stage four cancer and CAN'T GET ANY KIND OF PAIN RELIEF because all the doctors are AFRAID OF BEING BLAMED for people ""getting addicted"". 

It makes me sick to my stomach to think back at the THOUSANDS upon thousands of pills I saw over my law enforcement career - 99% of which was being taken by people who ADMITTEDLY had NOT A DAMN THING wrong with them **beyond the DESIRE TO GET HIGH**; and yet now society is perfectly happy to let those damn people BLAME DOCTORS. 

Like yeah- I'm right there with you: pill mills were total bullshit&amp; there were a TON of shady AF doctors making BIG MONEY off of writing people for whatever they wanted to abuse. But the loopholes and bullshit that went down SHOULD NOT be impacting EVERY person for the rest of history who may need pain medication of some kind. 

Just like you shouldn't be able to blame gun manufacturers for shooting crimes, or alcohol makers because people drive drunk- allowing addicts to BLAME THE DOCTORS that THEY SOUGHT OUT to give them the pills they wanted and subsequently ABUSED - it's not okay. 

I have Crohn's Disease and had MULTIPLE orthopedic surgeries between 1994 and 2007 - every single time I was given ANY kind of controlled substance; from cough syrup containing codeine - to iv pain medication during surgery - I was informed of the medications, the risks and how to safely take prescriptions. I was given booklets, verbal information about the medication's safety AND WARNINGS both in writing on the bottle AND from the pharmacist about misusing, abusing or over-taking any of these types of meds. 

There's no fucking way you're EVER going to convince me that anyone OH-SO-INNOCENTLY went to doctors, ACCIDENTALLY ended up on strong controlled substances and TRIPPED AND FELL into becoming a full blown drug addict- all without EVER having a clue that opiods could be dangerous or addictive. 

Doctors were merely the dealers- and anyone who lied about, exaggerated, or flat out MADE up symptoms or complaints to ""trick"" doctors into prescribing shit to them; THEY THEMSELVES are the ONLY ones to blame for the opiod crisis; they damn sure didn't care about ACTUAL sick and disabled people when they were getting their party drugs real cheap from ""Dr Jay"" every couple weeks. And they damn sure knew what they were doing when they invited every friend and family member they knew to join them in getting the SAME drugs too.",2

Morphine does get you high, but it's mainly a body thing rather than a brain thing. They give you just enough, in the hospital, to remove the pain.

Thebaine is more of a euphoric. That's why a lot of addicts prefer getting high on oxycodone (percocet) instead of hydrocodone (vicoden).

Once you refine it far enough, the differences kind of melt away. Hydromorphone will get you plenty high. It's still not as good of a buzz as oxymorphone. Heroin is a weird thing, it's diamorphone. It's both. So it has the body numbing effects of morphine and the mind altering effects of thebaine.",1

It's the same thing as well with them thinking I'm stupid and that there is no possibility they're wrong just because they use it.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

The fact that you have to dig back so far is telling.  Why didn't you mention the [Stanford prison experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) or some of Milgram's studies on power and influence.  Which of course were also highly immoral and spurred the medical industry to bring ethics approval for basically every new experiment or treatment, but I guess that doesn't matter any longer.  No point in being relevant though right, it gets in the way of being right.

 Oh, and yes big pharma is the target of lots of lawsuits.  Lawsuits are a legal function, not so much a scientific function.  And the US is one of the most litigious societies in the world.  Why didn't you mention the Vioxx lawsuits?  Some 4 million Americans took the medication for the 5 years it was on the market. The lawsuits established that the drug may have been involved in 140,000 heart attacks/strokes and may have played a part in up to 60,000 deaths.  It doesn't bother to stipulate how many of those individuals already had pre-existing heart conditions, but regardless the drug was taken off the market.  As a result, instead people needing pain relief turned to drugs like Oxycotin, and when that got taken off the market, fentanyl.  That has turned out really well, now hasn't it.  [Here is some stats](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#:~:text=Opioid%2Dinvolved%20overdose%20deaths%20rose,(Source%3A%20CDC%20WONDER).) on that.  Overdoses from prescription drugs quadrupled from 2005 to 2019.  And overdoses from all drugs tripled.   Here's the thing, anything you put in your body or on your body can have risks, everything.  But Americans are uniquely adept at suing over literally anything.  

So your point is that these vaccines are dangerous based on ancient immoral medical experiments that would never be allowed in today's society, because you know laws.  But somehow that makes the vaccine more dangerous than the COVID-19 virus.  I mean it's only killed almost 2.5 million people, so far.  And exactly how many of the current 160 million plus people who have received the vaccine have died?  Can you name a vaccine that has had symptoms that don't show up pretty much immediately?  Why do you have to rely on past actions to make your decisions?   Do you consider any of the reasons why over the same time period that all those bad things happened, the average lifespan of Americans has increased by 10 years?  What do you think caused that?   Do you seek out medical treatment when you are sick or injured?  Do you take any medications, or anything at all to treat your ailments?  Aspirin?   Do you trust any of that?  How?  I mean if you think your arguments are sufficient, who do you trust, because it sounds like nobody.",3

The “disease” isn’t something you either just have or don’t have. Some people have a genetic predisposition to addiction that can manifest in many different forms.  Long term use of opiates will almost always result in some degree of dependence if they are used long enough, reason being is that when taken regularly your body develops a tolerance so you require a higher dosage to remain pain free, assuming your pain levels are high enough (or if someone is seeking a more intense high).  At this point, your body isn’t producing as much endorphins as it naturally does because the opiates are triggering more than enough. Your brain learns to not release natural endorphins. Dopamine is also released by opiates and provides the feeling of pleasure/reward.  When an addicted person stops using opiates they can experience withdrawals because their brain isn’t yet producing endorphins normally again but also the opiates aren’t being taken so your body aches, you feel terrible. 

Some people experience more pleasure/reward than others when taking opiates and these people are at higher risk of addiction. 

When a person becomes dependent on opiates (or any drugs) their brain has essentially been rewired to “want” opiates. Again, some people experience this to greater degrees than others.  Your brain will “remember” where you left off while addicted so if you quit for a long time and then start using again, you will get to the level of use you were at before only it will only take a fraction of the amount of time it did originally.  This is where the disease part comes in because your brain is physiologically different now. You don’t have the disease before this point even if you have the genetic predisposition. 

I’m not a doctor, I just was a vicodin addict for a period of time around 15 years ago. I would have ripped through that 300 count bottle in under a month. Fortunately, I’m able to take opiates on the rare occasion like after surgery if I am careful. I’ve actually found that if I am actually in pain then the opioids don’t really give me the pleasure they once did so I don’t have a hard time stopping as long as the supply is very limited.  If I had a lot of them then I would almost certainly relapse.  Even thinking about that 300ct bottle gets me a little excited, which I guess is part of the disease.  Also fortunately, I don’t feel the need to seek out opioids anymore because I know the pleasure I’m seeking (like when I first started taking them) wont ever be felt again.  Best I’ll get from vicodin is a “meh” high no matter how much I take.  Interestingly enough, when I have had fentynyl prior to and after surgery I feel no pleasure from it.  I just get dopey, despite it being like 100x more powerful than morphine. 

Anyway, when I see people talking about the disease and that they don’t “have it” I feel it may help to inform them that they aren’t impervious to addiction.  You may be genetically disposed to NOT getting addicted to opioids but who knows, it could be cocaine, sex/porn, cigarettes that grabs ahold of you.",19

Foi ao lembrar que não se teve coragem para reagir às [provocações do general Eduardo Villas Bôas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/04/na-vespera-de-julgamento-sobre-lula-comandante-do-exercito-diz-repudiar-impunidade.shtml), três anos atrás.

 Ele era [comandante do Exército ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/bolsonaro-nao-e-volta-dos-militares-mas-ha-o-risco-de-politizacao-de-quarteis-diz-villas-boas.shtml)e opinou, sabemos agora que em harmonia com a cúpula militar, sobre o julgamento de Lula pelo Supremo. Claro, seu tuíte usou meias-palavras. Mas era preciso dar-lhe um basta quando ele se fez intérprete dos “cidadãos de bem” no “repúdio à impunidade”.

  

Na época, o então ministro Raul Jungmann, que hoje faz bem em condenar o avanço dos golpistas, [considerou “correta” a declaração do general](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/04/de-zero-a-dez-chance-de-golpe-e-menos-um-diz-jungmann.shtml).

 Já é tempo de cessarmos com tantos rapapés diante da arrogância militar.

 Antes do[ tuíte de Villas ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/02/tuite-do-general-villas-boas-sobre-lula-foi-atenuado-atuais-ministros-de-bolsonaro-discutiram-o-texto.shtml)[Bôas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/02/tuite-do-general-villas-boas-sobre-lula-foi-atenuado-atuais-ministros-de-bolsonaro-discutiram-o-texto.shtml), houve pronunciamento mais grave, feito em 2017 [pelo general Hamilton Mourão](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mLi9Wv1Pp4). Disse o seguinte: “Estamos numa situação de aproximações sucessivas, até chegar o momento em que ou as instituições solucionam o problema político, ou então nós teremos de impor isso. Os poderes terão de buscar uma solução. Se não conseguirem, chegará a hora em que teremos de impor uma solução. E essa imposição não será fácil.”

  Mourão não foi punido. Só foi para a reserva porque seu tempo como general atingira o máximo de 12 anos.

 Também faltou coragem para reagir, ainda em 2018, a uma [fala de Eduardo Bolsonaro ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/basta-um-soldado-e-um-cabo-para-fechar-stf-disse-filho-de-bolsonaro-em-video.shtml)(PSL-RJ), sem dúvida menos grosseira, mas de igual teor à que causou a[ prisão de Daniel Silveira](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/02/prisao-de-silveira-foi-marco-no-stf-e-na-camara-no-combate-ao-extremismo-diz-moraes.shtml).

 Numa palestra no Paraná, [ele disse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBOmPzrBluY): “O pessoal até brinca lá, se quiser fechar o STF, sabe o que você faz? Você não manda nem um jipe. Manda um soldado e um cabo. Não é querer desmerecer o soldado e o cabo, não”.

 Naquele momento, a ministra Rosa Weber optou por uma linha de prudência: “Juiz algum no país, juízes todos no Brasil [que] honram a toga, se deixa abalar por qualquer manifestação que eventualmente possa ser compreendida como conteúdo inadequado”.

 Também o ministro Marco Aurélio não se arriscou. “Vamos aguardar, com toda a serenidade, os acontecimentos.”

 Jair Bolsonaro cresceu em visibilidade quando, na [votação pelo impeachment de Dilma, elogiou um torturador](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml). A atitude era escandalosa, causou protestos, mas não foi levada suficientemente a sério.

 A famosa frase do[ “só não te estupro porque você não merece”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/12/1559815-para-rebater-deputada-bolsonaro-diz-que-nao-a-estupraria.shtml) já justificaria a cassação de Bolsonaro por falta de decoro parlamentar.

  

 A sociedade brasileira, e mesmo suas forças mais convictas na defesa da democracia, optou há muito pelo faz de conta. Na década de 1980, agradecemos com um sorriso quando os militares entregaram o poder.

 Fala-se da falta de [autocrítica da esquerda](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/demetriomagnoli/2017/03/1863579-a-corrupcao-esta-disseminada-mas-o-estado-odebrecht-veio-de-lula.shtml). Concordo.

 Mas é mais do que falta de autocrítica o que se passa entre os militares. Poderiam silenciar sobre as violências de 1964. Fazer como se não fosse mais com eles. Até hoje, entretanto, celebram o que fizeram.

 Autocrítica? A Marinha se recusa a homenagear, até hoje, o [marinheiro João Cândido](https://fotografia.folha.uol.com.br/galerias/1617311656639511-negros-que-fizeram-historia#foto-1617312378938042), líder da revolta contra o uso da chibata em 1910. O comprometimento com a tortura vem de longe.

 O fato é que a sociedade brasileira ainda tem medo dos militares. Sempre que consultado, o STF reafirma os princípios da anistia aos torturadores e assassinos a serviço do regime.

 No seu vídeo, Eduardo Bolsonaro indagava se a população sairia nas ruas para defender o Supremo depois que um cabo e um soldado resolvessem intervir pela instituição. Posso fazer o raciocínio inverso.

 Se fosse revogada a Lei da Anistia, quantos sairiam às ruas para defendê-la? E será que muitos generais teriam condições de dar um golpe para assegurar a impunidade de seus carrascos de estimação?

 Sem nenhum obstáculo real pela frente, é natural o avanço dos que sempre defenderam a ditadura militar, e querem instituí-la de novo.

 O vídeo de Silveira foi um novo passo, especialmente grotesco, nessa direção. Atacado diretamente, o Supremo reagiu, e[ teve apoio do Congresso](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/02/por-364-a-130-camara-confirma-decisao-do-stf-e-mantem-prisao-de-deputado-abandonado-pelo-planalto.shtml). Mas o bolsonarismo prepara, a olhos vistos, um golpe até 2022, ou logo depois das eleições.

 As instituições democráticas, tímidas desde 1988, têm deixado esse avanço acontecer. Por medo, cumplicidade ou indiferença, naturaliza-se uma situação com Paulo Guedes no céu e com a PM, o Exército e as milícias aqui embaixo.

3. Understand exactly what the the pain medications are, and set up a schedule or one of those timed pill boxes so that you can manage these. I ended up having a lot of discomfort for about two days (unusual, most people don't have much); and it was essential to get the meds right. (I had Oxcodone, Tylenol, and Advil, at maximum doses of the two latter NSAIDs). Be sure to talk to the doc or nurse, get these instructions clearly, and have a plan to managing these. In your haze you don't want to be asking yourself ""did I take that Oxycodone at 2 AM or not"". You also want to get ahead of any discomfort, rather than ""chasing it"" . . . it is much easier to stay comfortable than it is to dial down pain after it gets rough. Again, I don't want to scare you on this . . . wasn't horrible, and I was unusual, but if I had it to do again, I'd have been much more careful to be aggressive with the pain meds.",2

85,2021-02-23 02:36:29+00:00,"Those crime factors are related to the drug's illegality, however.  They increase crime because the penalties of sale and the money involved brings about scenarios where they'd rather kill than go to jail or lose the money.  

If those products were legal, the violence would be reduced as the sale penalties are reduced.  The adulterants are no longer an issue so use and overdose reduces.  The cost is lowered dramatically andbthe crimes (theft robbery etc) involved with these drugs are reduced as the cost is now affordable even by the lowest incomes.   

Heroin from the street can be so wildly varied.  But guess what, that dimorphine in the hospital? Same every single time. Every single time.  The dosage is known and understood.  It isn't randomly spiked with fentanyl. Understand the why of overdoses before you use that as an exame.  

Meth fumes. This doesn't exist.  Fumes exist from the production of meth, they are not related to meth per se, that's chemistry.  If it was legal and available from proper origins this would not exists. As well if it were legal subterfuge and lack of safety equipment would be less of a concern for dea tracking.  People wouldn't do as much dumb shit.  And less dumb shit is better than what we have now since no one seems to give a fuck if it is illegal if they use. 

Stop the slippery slope nonsense.  

What needs to be done is that it needs to be recognized as a very real genetic / neurostructural medical disorder.  

Easy to not understand addiction when you can break an arm and take the fentanyl the medic pops you with in the ambulance and the vicodin they send you home with and not be driven to seek it out.  Lucky you.  Lucky me too.  Except we are not the only type with this particular case.  Some people.  That would be the end of their life as they know it.  One try and they're going to seek it out.  Variant polymorphisms in Dopamine genetic subunits ,(D2 for example) have high incidence of opiate abuse with those who have the variant.  Because they're not like you or me.  They get that vicodin for that broken arm and then they get the hydrocodone from their coworker then they are taking roxy's and they can't find any so they try the ever prevalent heroin, cheap easy and available more than the pills, but also adulteranted as fuck, how much should they use same amount as last 3 times, except this time it is full of fentanyl. Their life over. All cos we decided what they did was criminal, and we made their disease self medicate with more and more dangerous chemicals.  

It is a disease.  End of story. It is not a abhorrent behavior, there is a neurological difference between us and them.  You can't understand that unless you really spend time with a number of addicts. Listen to them.  I've worked with harm reduction groups for decades now.  These laws they ruin lives, they're why opiate overdose kills so many.  The response the idiots have is to make it more illegal, instead of making it legal to stay alive by using safely until they can get the proper help they need all while removing their employment opportunities by giving them a felony for having disease.  Those laws against drugs are a true human rights violation, they ruin lives more than the drugs do themselves.",1

88,2021-02-23 01:03:26+00:00," Uma greve geral contra o golpe militar em Mianmar fechou empresas nesta segunda (22) e grandes multidões protestaram em várias partes do país. Os atos foram realizados mesmo após a junta militar [advertir que os ativistas correm risco de morte ao irem a manifestações](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/02/facebook-bane-pagina-do-exercito-em-mianmar-e-milhares-voltam-as-ruas-apos-dia-sangrento.shtml).

 Nesta segunda, centenas de milhares de pessoas se reuniram em várias cidades. Os protestos foram os maiores desde [o golpe, em 1º de fevereiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/01/lider-do-mianmar-e-presa-e-acao-gera-temor-de-golpe-no-pais.shtml), segundo o jornal The Washington Post.

 A data foi escolhida para grandes atos por ter cinco números dois: ""22/2/2021"". Ativistas viram relação disso com ""8/8/1988"", dia de grandes protestos contra outro regime militar que dominou o país, quase 33 anos atrás.

 As autoridades militares voltaram a cortar o acesso à internet na madrugada de segunda-feira, pela oitava noite consecutiva, segundo a NetBlocks, entidade com sede no Reino Unido.

 Na capital, Naypiytaw, canhões de água disparados pela polícia interromperam uma marcha de manifestantes. Os jatos jogaram muitos deles ao chão.

 Em Rangoon, maior cidade do país. milhares de pessoas se reuniram. Em um dos atos, manifestantes sentaram no chão e exibiram bandeiras de apoio à [chefe de governo deposta, Aung San Suu Kyi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/02/sem-aura-de-heroina-suu-kyi-encara-o-velho-normal-com-golpe-em-mianmar.shtml), que está detida desde 1º de fevereiro em um local não divulgado.

  Muitos mercados e outros estabelecimentos comerciais permaneceram fechados em solidariedade ao movimento pró-democracia. Também foram registradas manifestações nas cidades de Myitkyina (norte) e Dawei (sul).

 ""Estamos aqui para participar na manifestação, para lutar até a vitória"", disse à Reuters o estudante Kyaw Kyaw, 23, em Rangoon. ""Nada vai acontecer se meu salário for cortado, mas se ficarmos sob uma ditadura militar, vamos ser escravos.""

 ""O Exército tomou o poder injustamente do governo civil eleito"", afirmou um manifestante de 29 anos, que pediu anonimato. ""Lutaremos até obter nossa liberdade, democracia e justiça.""

 No domingo (21) à noite, as autoridades advertiram que ""os manifestantes estão incitando as pessoas, sobretudo os adolescentes e jovens exaltados, a seguir o caminho do confronto no qual morrerão"", segundo um comunicado lido no canal de televisão estatal MRTV, com legendas em inglês.

 No domingo, [ativistas prestaram homenagem](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/02/facebook-bane-pagina-do-exercito-em-mianmar-e-milhares-voltam-as-ruas-apos-dia-sangrento.shtml) à primeira vítima da repressão, uma jovem que se tornou ícone da resistência. O funeral de Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, atingida por um tiro na cabeça e que faleceu após dez dias de internação, reuniu milhares de pessoas na periferia de Naypyidaw.

 No sábado morreram duas pessoas em Mandalay e uma terceira em Rangoon, vítimas da repressão policial. De acordo com a associação de ajuda aos presos políticos, 640 pessoas foram detidas desde o golpe.

 A preocupação da comunidade internacional é cada vez maior. O secretário-geral da ONU, António Guterres, condenou nesta segunda-feira a ""força brutal"" utilizada pelos militares. ""Peço ao Exército de Mianmar que pare a repressão imediatamente, liberte os prisioneiros, acabe com a violência e respeite os direitos humanos e a vontade do povo expressada nas recentes eleições"", afirmou Guterres, na abertura da 46ª sessão do Conselho de Direitos Humanos das Nações Unidas.

 Também nesta segunda, os ministros das Relações Exteriores da União Europeia advertiram que estão dispostos a adotar sanções contra os militares, depois que Estados Unidos, Reino Unido e Canadá tomaram decisões nesse sentido.

 O Ministério das Relações Exteriores de Mianmar classificou as medidas estrangeiras de ""interferência flagrante"" nas questões internas do país. ""Apesar das manifestações ilegais, as incitações aos distúrbios e a violência, as autoridades dão mostras de grande contenção, recorrendo o mínimo possível à força para enfrentar as perturbações"", afirmou o ministério em um comunicado.

 O Exército[ vem tentando usar supostas acusações de fraude no pleito ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/02/entenda-como-foi-dado-o-golpe-de-estado-em-mianmar.shtml)como justificativa para a tomada de poder. Os militares também acrescentaram à narrativa o argumento de que a comissão eleitoral do país usou a pandemia de coronavírus como pretexto para impedir a realização de uma campanha justa. Dizem ainda que agiram de acordo com a Constituição e que a maior parte da população apoia sua conduta, acusando manifestantes de incitarem a violência.

 O general Min Aung Hlaing, que assumiu o controle do país com o golpe, decretou em 1º de fevereiro um estado de emergência que deve durar um ano. “Colocaremos em operação uma verdadeira democracia multipartidária”, declarou o novo regime, acrescentando que o poder será transferido após “a realização de eleições gerais livres e justas”. [A promessa, apesar de reiterada](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/02/militares-de-mianmar-repetem-promessa-de-novas-eleicoes-e-lider-civil-deposta-enfrenta-mais-acusacoes.shtml), é encarada com ceticismo pelos mianmarenses opositores e por observadores internacionais.

 A LND, partido de Suu Kyi que comanda o país desde 2015, obteve 83% dos votos e conquistou 396 dos 476 assentos no Parlamento nas últimas eleições, realizadas em novembro do ano passado. A legenda, entretanto, foi impedida de assumir quando o golpe foi aplicado no dia da posse da nova legislatura. O Partido da União Solidária e Desenvolvimento, apoiado pelos militares, obteve apenas 33 cadeiras. ​

 Mianmar tem um violento histórico de reações a protestos. Na revolta de 1988, mais de 3.000 manifestantes foram mortos pelas forças de segurança do país durante atos contra o regime militar —o país viveu sob uma ditadura de 1962 a 2011. ​

89,2021-02-22 22:30:28+00:00,"I think a big part of the opioid crisis in the US is originated in the way the opioids have been prescribed in the past and maybe still today ? I read that e.g. Oxycodone have been prescribed for migrain and all kind of pain that does not need such strong painkillers. When i heard about how Fentanyl was prescribed i lost it. Its unbelivabel for me how it was prescribed to such an absurd number of non-cancer patients and in such ridicioulus doses. A lot of now addicts have to be blamed on prescriptions and thats pretty insane. I understand those people. Its easy to get addicted and if its prescribed very easy a vicious circle starts. Once your addicted and you want more then prescribed or the prescriptions and refill stops people get in the streets. The result is this crisis.

If people want to legalize weed im all in but the majority of people could not handle fully legal opioids. I think a abuse safe low potency opioid like a variety of e.g. Tramal could be an option for adults to buy without prescription. If there is no way of iv, boofing, snorting or whatever abuse and people get well informed of possible addiction that might be an option.

I understand some people feel patronized by restrictions but its a tribute to society that restrictions exist. There is so much pain and suffering caused from misused opioids just in the US that iam shocked everytime i look at the numbers. In my country it is nearly impossibel to get opioids like Oxycodon or Fentanyl without a pretty well based dagnosis and a proofed need of such strong painkillers. Fast acting Fentanyl is like 99% cancer pain only and almost no way getting it for less.

There might be no heaven or any kind of gods or afterlife but that doesnt mean we should make earth even more a horribel place then it allready is. And if you think nobody cares then make the first step to change. If you realy dont care why are you posing here ? We all need some socialising and care. It is our indisputable nature and nobody can deny.

In some countrys people get medical pure Heroin to prevent consuming any kind of dirt up their body and they can get help quitting every time they want. I agree with you that criminals and illegal drug selling is a enormous problem but i think legalising everything is not a good approach.

The problem is dose increasing, cut product, and of course if you take enough and it becomes your only drive. Stuff like meth, NDMA drugs and I guess even coke to an extent can fry your brain but morphine just does its thing and (for the most part) you can be ok using. and for coke given its taken just like coffee and not in crazy increasing doses you can be ok but id say less so than opioids.

Honestly there is a huge wealth of people who self dose amphetamines for their job. People who just take some benzos a day. Ppl (kinda) like that Rami Malek character who occasionally do morphine or opioids. They are dependent users who don't freakishly increase dose. They dont play with untested shit and dont chase the dragon they hold jobs in silicon Valley, wall street, law firms and grocery stores and you dont hear about them cux rhey dont die and dont sell.

I haven't known any heroin users who had a good job and a stable home life before they started using heroin. All the ones I have known were unemployed from an unstable home life and were massive poly-drug users before getting into heroin.

As far as I can tell there is almost no significant sample of ""what happens when you give a normal put together person heroin"" because the social stigma and reputation for life ruining is so great that basically no normal put together person is trying it, outside of medical treatments where people are often given heroin (diamorphene) for surgical pain and don't seem to exhibit any of the life ruining addiction potential because its not taken in the context of recreation.",1

111,2021-02-21 17:21:51+00:00,"**In two short lines you really attributed a lot of false narrative into what I said.**

**I put quotes around it because that's what the government and media like to call it either that or ""crisis"".**

**And no, I don't at all think it's a hoax.** 

We have seen the court cases against the makers of Oxycotin and many doctors and pharmacies that were clearly pill mills. 

What I take issue with is chronic pain sufferers who have no better medical option available to them, just getting cut off (often cold turkey), eased down if you're lucky.

For instance, the VA has cut my 90 year old Grandfather's decade+ long prescription by 1/4, and are using scam telemarketer techniques to try to get him to say on the phone he doesn't even need the 90 a month he has left when he needs his full 120 back and truely needs something stronger than 10mg Norco. 

I've seen the massive bottle of what was Vicodin at the time my Grandmother had as she was slowing passing. And I've seen the cocktail of opioids including Morphine Sulfate my other Grandma was given for over 6 months on her death bed a few years ago. It became clear to anyone with two brain cells that her hospice ""care"" is not to make you comfortable on your way out, but speed up that process by slowing down your central nervous system thus your breathing.

The WHO has already long ago retracted their earlier new guidelines on opioids admitting it caused more harm than good.

We hear stories about busted pill mills like once a month it's clearly simple to find the outliers and stop them without harming the completely legitimate patients.

Also, and how true it is I don't know but I've heard a main reason a lot of doctors offices that were still prescribing them until recently is because their insurance companies for malpractice want to jack their rate up if they prescribe them.

Keep in mind the black market has never been better, just absolutely thriving they have that shit down like it's Amazon. So again the ones left to suffer are the legitimate patients, the junkies are doing just as fine as a junkie can.

126,2021-02-21 02:12:41+00:00,"Hi /u/cyantaco,  

Your post and your post history are a mess of chemicals, medicines, recent seemingly questionable coping strategies, and all or most of it has nothing to do with Kundalini itself.  

All of it ignores Rule 1 - No Drugs talk, and rule 5, keep on topic.  

Jeezuz man, I feel for ya, but this sub is not a space for you.  

The sub actively and stronglt teaches a no-drugs idea with reagrds to when Kundalini is present.  

We have no way of knowing whether that is present in you or not, yet if so, any drugs that make you stoned or unable to access your sound judgment would be a problem, not a help *for Kundalini*.  

You might otherwise need them for your own psychological balance. No arguments there.  

&gt;But I feel like I'm going mad.  

There are some signs of that. I trust you are already seeing a Psychiatrist. Bring that feeling up with them. It could be that they need to adjust your meds. If I understand correctly, you're trying to get off benzos. It's doable, yet some meds that are less addictive and have less side-effects can apparently help.  

&gt;I have an Eastern doctor that told me to continue learning reiki and help heal people in my heroim inflicted city.   

I personally would discourage you from doing Reiki on anyone but yourself until you've been sober many consistent months, and are becoming successful or have successfully weaned off your worst-side-effect medicines.  

Your history shows someone who's only half trying. Trying rather hard, yet hoping to fail for some fun - at least that's how it seems. That would put you at fairly extreme risk with regards Kundalini.  

Adding your drug-affected energy, no matter how well-intentionned, is unwise and could incur the kinds of karma that would prevent you from healing.  

Using Reiki requires a significant sacredness that I'm not sure you understand. Are you capable of it? Probably in some moments... yet moments only.   

Helping people heal? Yes, that's a fine idea. Leave energy out of it as I've noted above. Once you're stable again and sober for 6 to 9 months, THEN reconsider it.    

Good luck to you and good journey.

128,2021-02-21 01:22:47+00:00,"Yeah, well oxycodone has an oral bioavailability between 67-80%. Whereas Dilaudid is between 30-40%.

I’ve noticed something. 

Hydrocodone (oral bioavailability of ~70%) is to Hydromorphone (oral bioavailability between 30-40%), and 
Oxycodone (oral bioavailability between 67-80%) is to Oxymorphone (oral bioavailability of 10%),
As Codeine (oral bioavailability of ~90%) is to Morphine (oral bioavailability between 20-40%). 

So all the CODONE components have a high oral bioavailability, but the MORPHONE components have a rubbish bioavailability. 

I want to find out why? I know that codeine, hydrocodone and oxycodone all metabolise into morphine, hydromorphone and oxymorphone respectively. Which is what causes a lot of them to have some potency, instead of nothing. But morphine, hydromorphone and oxymorphone are very potent. Is the problem that the liver breaks them down? 

Did you know that as a rule, kids aren’t supposed to have pro-drugs like codeine or hydrocodone. Oxycodone is technically not a pro-drug. It’s already extremely potent. The reason, is that some kids are rapid-metabolisers. They can produce too much morphine or hydromorphone and OD. 

A pro-drug can’t be injected straight into the bloodstream. As it bypasses the metabolism in the liver, which turns it into an active form. But even though oxycodone metabolises into the stronger Oxymorphone. You can administer it via IV and treat moderate to severe pain.",1

134,2021-02-20 21:11:11+00:00,"Codeine is so incredibly variable in its efficacy as a prodrug for morphine.  Oxycodone for oral biovailability, buprenorphine for sublingual, and morphine for oral or injection, and hydro morphone for more rapid pain relief as well as certain forms of other medications (injectable a should never be over the counter... but prohibition of them just means people will produce and obtain them in even less safe ways... hence, safe places where they can be purchased and delivered like a “shot” at a bar.  With people to monitor vitals and bounce people like at a bar.  Most people (some would... just like with alcoholics) but most  wouldn’t actually find it a preferable way to spend their lives, especially when they know they can do it if they want and not worry about availability/supply/  going into withdrawal if they don’t shoot up (not as long as their tolerance isn’t through the roof and buprenorphine or oxycodone is available in pill forms.  Also... if people do decide they want to nod their life away for a period... it’s better if, when they decide they aren’t happy with it anymore, are tired of not pooping, etc... they don’t have hep C and a rap sheet.  I mean... most people go through phases where they would qualify as alcoholics and a lot of those people think of it synonymously with college.  

I’m not pretending it will stop abuse to have legal ways of recreational fentanyl use... just that it would minimize the damage.  Everyone is different.  I’ve had fentanyl more than a dozen times for various procedures or pre meds for surgery plus long term chronic pain complications from a snakebite.  Honestly, it was never a feeling I enjoyed.  It was too much.  Hydrocodone, however, gives me a milder sleepy feeling I really enjoy as an insomniac.  I was on it for over a year (legally, but also not a low 5mg once a day dose or anything, it was a dose that required weaning to avoid physical withdrawal).  It wasn’t fun, but I went off it if my own free will.  Eventually the side effects weren’t  worth the effects and I found other ways to manage my pain.  If I’d been kicked off of it in the middle of that when my pain was at its worst... let’s just say I can see why heroin and other black market opiate use deaths rose so sharply exactly when prescription dose limits did exactly that to millions of people who had been on stable, legal, doses of opiates for years that were suddenly illegal doses.  I mean... what did law makers expect?  Something like that was the opposite of what would help.  

I’m glad your better man.  And I’m glad I don’t have the disposition for fentanyl.  Same with alcoholism.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

166,2021-02-19 00:22:21+00:00,"First off I need to say that, there isn't smth like percocet 30mg. Percocet is only up to 10/325mg. What you take are fake oxycodon 30mg. Sorry for the lecture. Anyways,in some sort you trade your fent habit for a sub habit but you now know for 100% that there is no fent in your pills and you will be much safer now. At first you should get stabilized on the subs, that will take between 1-3 month. And then you can talk to your doctor about tapering down and getting off subs. If you got the feeling that you need the subs now so you don't relapse then you should take them as long as needed and until you reach the point where you feel safe to get off and don't relapse. If you don't want to stay for long on them and feel strong enough that you don't relapse then you can also talk to your doctor now about your plans on not taking them long term and getting off them as quick as possible. If you just take them now that you don't get any wd symptoms then you can also talk to your doc about it and maybe he will make a tapering plan with and for you so that you just take them for a few weeks. I just know it from methadone but the longer you stay on them the harder it gets to get off them. So my advice would be to talk to the doctor about every option he can offer to you and also listen to him what he tells you, you are not his first patient on subs and he probably can tell you how he sees it and he also have seen alot of patients going through the same like you. I wish you all the best for your further way buddy.

OH and one more question if you already were 2 weeks clean, then you went through wds probably without any medical help, why did you get back on opioids again? Are you afraid of relapsing? And always keep in mind that your tolerance is way down now, so if you relapse on fent 30s then they will smack waaay harder and the sik of ODing is pretty high",1

Its not your responsibillity to decide what people believe, just becauae you call what i say lies doesnt make it true, let them see both of our arguments for their merits and if your truly believe you are right then you must assume theyll agree with you.

Read through that autopsy, not every word thatd take forever, didnt see anything about homicide. I did however see the shit ton of fetanyl he took, which can cause death by asphyxiation and the shit ton of caffeine he had which has an affect and that he had covid 19 and potentially sickle cell disease, so clearly theres a case to be made for him not dying of homicide. If it does say it in that documeny please point out where.

Ill give you the thing about the officer, i mustve read fake news or misremembered, either way i wasnt lying, because to lie you must know what your saying isnt true, i was however incorrect on that singular point, and i will concede that.

You have only now provided sources, which is fine, i dont really care for them anyway but if you feel they back your argument good for you. Id rather take the long way round where you work out what you agree happened with each and then well know why we disagree. Also i think my argument works without sources anyway, since the bodycam footage shows no evidence of racism.

Just because you disagree doesnt mean youre right, watch the video i linked, would be interesting to hear what you think. You have been arguing against me saying that it wasnt a homicide this entire time, if you dont think hes guilty the you have a really fucked up view of homicide. And im pretty sure youve mentioned racism, but if you havent, it doesnt matter anyway because my point is that the protests are pointless because it wasnt racist, so its just a mundane regular murder case, if it happened to white person, which it does, funnily enough more often than black people, thered be no protests and wed have probably never heard about it.",-1

First I thing before I start this monologue I have to address the ""safest injection location"" because the topic gives a bit false claim that us humans have this place where injecting is the most safest. I must dissagree 100 % because to implie that we as humans would have inherent place or spot on our bodies that would be ""safest"" to put a needle thru your skin, pierce the vain, push the plunger and seriously feel any sense of relief because the spot you happen to choose was the safest is one of the most wrong and misquided approach to IV use I have heard for a long time. Putting it simple before I go oon with this subject is wise (at least in my mind) to STOP putting information that any of us would have this magical injection spot somewhere in our bodies that would make IV use any less risky!! There is no such place and never will be.

 I tell you again: There is NO place to found in my or your body that choosing this ""special"" place is some how less harmful, it's absolutely missleading and false.

If you have read this post this long I would make my self a total hypocrite if I would not tell my techiques. Some of them were teached and some just works for me. Only proof of how valid these are I can answer only this: ZERO colapsed vains, abcess, infections on +10 years of amphetamines, meth, coke, pills (mostly Oxycodon) ketamine R &amp; S Isomers, 2C family, methylone, mephedrone..

Well hope you get the scope.


Now when that subject is out of the way lets talk about what the basics and on my opinion one of the most overlooked area when talking about intravenous use is the instruments you are planning to use:

 new unused plungers that you use only and ONLY once, 

correct size needle for your vains. Im ""lucky"" in a way that the veins on my arms are very near the surface, pretty thick and I can use large variety of different size needles whit no problems.
But this is just me, many people have very small vains on their arms and these situations  I would try the find the most thin needle you can find and start from there.

Microfilters. Doesn't cost much but can filter 99,9 % of all the little jerms and unwanted visitors that are eager to have access to your bloodstream and cause serious reactions including death.

Last but not least: rotation, rotation, rotation. Poking same area years after years scar tissue starts to cover the area you have become so fond of. There are so many places on our body to shoot up, and sticking the one and only place is often (at least it was on My case a pure carelesnes on my behalf at the Time)

Thanks for this sub for letting me address something that all stigma, shame etc. Can also be practiced in way that gives time your body heal and if nothing else then get know how your own body and blood circulation works.

If you going to do it, please spend even a little time on ""Harm Reduction"" I guarantee that these basic tips can be learned almost by anyone.

The biggest question is ultimately on your hands: do I love my self enough to practice IV using rules, even when thin vail of love might become selfhatered.

Thanks If you managed to read this far and because english is not my native language, there might be some typos but hopefully this wont be my last writing about these topics.

I just had mine on the 11th! And the 0verall experience was quite similar to yours. Besides the nausea. I didn't throw up. 
But I believe I heard the post op nurse say she gave me 20mg(?) of fentenyl as I was waking up. I meant to tell them before going in that I didn't want to receive any fentynal whatsoever as I dont have a tolerance but because the intake was so quick and smooth I forgot to mention it. 
I also had a dnc at the same time, and did lose a litre of blood on the table which they were concerned about, so going into recovery I was conscious and doing good. But after a couple of minutes my bpm started dropping and I started to loose consciousness. I think the after care nurse missed the memo and didn't know what to do because she didn't like my readings and kept taking readings and then leaving the room and coming back to retest. And then she went on lunch break. So I had to try really really hard to stay conscious on my own because the relief nurse had a bunch of ppl to release. 
I was quite out of it and just wanted to get out of there so I failed to ask the doc whether I lost the blood because of my salpingectomy or dnc. It would've been nice to know.
Oh and the doc didn't want me to leave until he tested my hemoglobin levels, so while fighting to stay conscious the vampire lady came and took another 2 viles of blood. His recommendation for the next 6 weeks is iron+ vic c supplements. 
As I write that all out I realize maybe my experience wasn't the best but I felt like it went great!

245,2021-02-14 14:01:21+00:00,"Tut mir leid ich finde das eine unglaublich naive Herangehensweise, quasi die Werbung von Methadonherstellern nachzuzitieren. ""Harte Drogen"" gibt's aus wissenschaftlicher Sicht sowieso erstmal nicht, aber gut das ist eine andere Debatte. ""Den die meisten nicht schaffen"" ist völlig unfundiert, da das empirisch kaum erforscht ist und viel Drogenkonsum wegen seiner Illegalität im Allgemeinen kaum erforscht ist. Genannte Zahlen beziehen sich meistens auf die Anzahl von Personen, die in bestimmtem Zeitrahmen eine Suchttherapie ersuchten, was natürlich überhaupt nicht repräsentativ ist.
Die längere Halbwertszeit und das konstantere High ist der Vorteil ggü. Diamorphin(hc) z.B., aber auch der Nachteil. Methadon gibt einem nicht den Rausch, die psychische Komponente der Abhängigkeit (bei Opiaten deutlich größere Problematik als die körperliche Abhängigkeit, wenn wir von längeren Zeiträumen sprechen!) wird gänzlich ignoriert. Das führt dazu, dass viele Betroffene andere Ventile suchen und sehr häufig bei Kokain landen, da Opiate ja nicht mehr den Effekt haben können.
Insofern ist meine Konklusion genau Gegenteilig: Methadon als Hilfsmittel, um starke körperliche Gewöhnung (die bei Kaltentzug zu starken Schmerzen, Krämpfen etc führt..) langsam abzubauen aber nicht als langfristige Substitution.
Wir müssen auch endlich weg von dem Gedanken des ""Cleanseins"" (und daraus folgend des Dreckigseins von Konsument*innen) kommen.
Drogen sind was das angeht wie Sex, Heroin sowieso. Wenn mensch's einmal erlebt hat will mensch es immer wieder. Das kann zu problematischem Verhalten führen und mit vielen schädlichen bis tödlichen Nebenwirkungen kommen. Aber Abstinenz vom Geschlechtsverkehr ist auch nicht unbedingt die Lösung. Das mag für manche der Fall sein, aber gelegentlicher Konsum ist grundsätzlich möglich und weder moralisch verwerflich noch unbedingt schädlich.
Insofern bin ich auch Gegnerin solcher Programme, die einem Münzchips um die Ohren werfen für jeden Abstinenzserienmeilenstein.

""Mirá, mejor no voy a decir nada, mi hijo se va a enojar -lanza suspicaz-. Les di mi jubilación, mi pensión y unos aros y collares que tanto lamento"". Vuelve a pedir otro acercamiento y mira hacia la puerta. ""Me llevaron una joya de oro, pero nadie sabe"".

&gt; Los delicuentes estuvieron casi una hora y media dentro de la casa y de la fábrica de Bernal, adonde arrastraron a Chola con un desprecio y una violencia incomprensible.

&gt; Algo cansada, no menciona recetas mágicas ni fórmulas, ella prefiere decir que tiene ""**un poder en la mente que me permite tener frescura** para llegar hasta donde llegué"".

Si llego, quiero hacerlo bien, sino hasta donde me toque, ya no me quejo, tuve una gran vida"", reflexiona. ¿Qué les diría a los ladrones que la atacaron? ""¿Por qué fueron tan crueles conmigo? ¿Por qué arrastrarme de los pelos, o me patearme estando en el piso? **No les guardo rencor, pobre gente, me da mucha lástima**"".

Donald Trump was not cancelled for being a white male.

And a lot of straight white men were called out rightfully for doing stuff. 

&gt;The demonisation of Derek Chauvin when he literally just defended the public from Floyd who was armed, dangerous and high on fentayl.

By choking him to death over 8 minutes? Seems excessive to me.

&gt;A greater number of ""priveleged"" white people are killed by so called ""white supremacist"" (actually just black supremacist) police than blacks,

Not per capita.

278,2021-02-12 16:21:18+00:00,"I can’t say I get euphoria from any opiate I’ve ever tried. Some increase my BP (morphine IR). Currently the best IR for pain relief is Oxycodone (and I take a large dose 30-60 mg every 4-6, PRN). I however selected Exalgo as the best as it has had the best pain control of any long acting I’ve tried. Unfortunately the pharmacy direct cost went up to over $800 per month and insurance only pays them around 200, so they were losing too much money filling it for me. Transitioned to MSContin (which only doesn’t raise my BP like the IR does, told probably different additives in the IR I took) because it is widely available and cheap. Not nearly the same level of pain control. I have a history of Trigeminal Nueralgia and significant surgical complications from MVD. Many other diagnoses as well. Been in PM for 7 years now.",1

NOT. 

I have Severe physically disability, was turned down for disability payments because well most are. Severe chronic pain. Incurable. Genetic. Severe. Chronic. Pain And thats not counting my autistic and mental illness

The only treatments for this are physical therapy - which insurance wont cover - and medications - which drs are not giving bc of the opidemic. I'm not asking for fentalyl or whatever, I just need something to make the pain go down enough to make me not constantly suicidal

But you dont really care, do you?",1
280,2021-02-12 14:53:36+00:00,"I was originally due on 2/8
 But I was 0% dilated
0% effaced. 
I never lost a mucus plug or had any cramping and baby was still sitting high. 
The doctor reccomended an induction so I went in on 2/10 at 730 to get that started


Around 9pm they gave me cytotec
Which opened me up a little but not much. 

They tried the pitocon around 4 and it was AWFUL, while checking to see if I was dilated my water broke and I got the nurse wet.... 

I was crying I couldn’t move, they gave me fentnyl at 6 and said I can have more at 8.

Well by 8 I was screaming and crying in pain all my cramps were in my back. 
Hitting a hammer to my spine would have been preferable. I threw up from the pain:

I was only 2.5 cms when they allowed me to have an epidural. I didn’t even feel it they timed it with the contractions. But BOY did that shit make a difference!!

I was able to nap on and off the rest of the day, watched some TV, tried not to annoy my BF.

Finally around 9pm I was getting back pains. I asked for them to up the epideral but they said the back pains were labor pains (felt like my a-hole was being fisted) 
Tried my best but I was begging for a c section.
I asked for stool softeners, for a numbing cream. Anything to make my butthole feel better.

The nurse said the babe was pressed against it and it’s good it means labor was coming.

I was switching from left side to right side. Trying to make her move down. She was still high!!!

Finally around 11 we called the doctor and she was driving from a different hospital😑

I couldn’t wait.

I started pushing at 11pm. And she was out by 1135. It was me, my boyfriend our nurse and a different doc who had enough time to put some gloves on and catch this precious angel....

Our original doctor showed up 15 minutes later :/

Anyways idk if I had 28 hours of labor. Or 35. But it was ALL worth it.

3rd degree tears all inside me up to my bladder.

290,2021-02-12 04:44:06+00:00,"I don't think his primary point is 'don't vote'. I encourage voting, I believe it's your civic responsibility to vote. However, I think that modern politics is a big dog and pony show. There are elite billionaire old money oligarchs who call the shots and make the policies for this world, especially the United States. The president is just a figurehead. The real powers behind the curtain don't give a shit who is president, as long as the general population is too busy fighting each other over which statues to take down and which bathroom people can use to notice the vast wealth that they are stealing right out of our pockets. 

Didn't you notice all this identity politics/racism bullshit started getting pushed really hard right around when Occupy Wallstreet started to gain traction? 

Politics is nothing but theater. It's a big distraction so we don't pay attention to things like 
1. The Sackler family profiting billions and billions of dollars over-selling OxyCotin pills, bribing doctors to push it, and by all accounts are just well-connected synthetic heroin dealers who got a slap on the hand for their criminal behavior
2. We take 35% of every single person's paycheck almost all of it goes straight to weapons development. Then we sell those weapons to other countries and the weapon contractors pocket the money
3. Hedge funds and politicians do insider trading so much that they had to make it LEGAL for members of the senate to do insider trading. Like, out of all the people who could do the most damage by insider trading, senators are probably at the top. And they're fucking IMMUNE to insider trading laws. 

If you are making hundreds of millions of dollars in capital gains because your sister-in-law is a senator and tips you off when new laws are coming (Just a random example off the top of my head - When they mandated all police wear bodycams, they basically picked one single company to supply all the bodycams. Guess what happened to that stock) then you do not give a shit if Caitlin Jenner calls himself a man or a woman, what president golfs when, or any other low-level nonsensical bullshit that we are made to focus on because the real power players only want one single thing more than money:
To not be noticed so they can continue making their money.

It's called controlled opposition. 

Give people only one orange juice brand in the grocery store, and they will be upset. But put that orange juice into 2 different packages; make one fancy and one bland. Sell the fancy one for $2 more. Now there is the illusion of choice, and the customers are happy, even though it's the same fucking orange juice. This is the same as the 2 party system.",1

294,2021-02-12 01:09:32+00:00,"Not one person has died at a safe injection site in B.C. Not even one. More than half of overdoses in the province occurred in private residences. Fentanyl was the cause of 80% of all overdose deaths in the province. Safe supply isn't a long term solution, but it is an emergency effort to try to save more lives. The overwhelming majority of people dying from overdoses are dying because of how toxic the supply of drugs currently is. How are safe injection sites, safe supply, destigmatization, and decriminalization making the supply more toxic? Oh wait, they aren't, because its the pandemic doing it. Fentayl is the cause of almost all deadly overdoses in the province, and the people dying from overdoses are most commonly doing so in a private residence. If these people had their drugs tested and administered at a safe injection site, the overdose death rate would most likely be zero. That's 1700 lives saved. But because of criminalization, people are going to keep overdosing from fentanyl and other extremely dirty and dangerous drugs. If you have a better idea to deal with this, backed by science and fact, please share. But almost all doctors and scientists, including the Chief coroner, agree that the increase of overdose deaths is not fueled by safe supply or safe injection but rather people doing street drugs by themselves.

So to combat the ""unprofessional"" names, people have been trying to rebrand it. So you might see some dispensaries calling it Girl Scout Cookies and others calling it just GSC. You get a lot of interesting street names for different strains because anyone can theoretically make their own strain, grow it, and have it take off like GSC, Blue Dream, and, yes, Gorilla Glue. Gorilla Glue is a personal favorite strain of mine and I always introduce the specific version I get to people as ""Gorilla Glue 4 or GG4"", using both the street name and professional name.

317,2021-02-10 17:24:25+00:00,"Schwierige Situation. Er ist ""nur"" dein Mitbewohner, natürlich auch Freund nehme ich an, lass ihm auf jeden Fall seine Freiheit, zu tun und lassen was er will. ABER du hast genau dieselbe Freiheit zu sagen, dass du dich unwohl fühlst wenn er das macht, außerdem es dich verletzt wenn er dich anlügt und du im Endeffekt nicht tolerieren musst, dass er in deiner Gegenwart/Wohnung ständig auf Drogen ist, das ist klar. 3-MMC kann man sich durchaus spritzen, ich bezweifle aber, dass das die einzige Droge ist die er konsumiert. Schon gar nicht wenn er wirklich schon am Intravenös Konsumieren ist. Sucht ist eine Krankheit, das Lügen gehört (zumindest anfangs) dazu, das kommt davon, dass er sich schämt, sich selbst auch belügt weil er bestimmt weiß was er tut aber die Sucht es ihm nicht ermöglicht aufzuhören, der erste Schritt, es zuzugeben, dass man ein Problem hat, oder überhaupt gegenüber jemandem, vor dem man es immer verheimlicht hat, darüber zu reden ist für ihn extrem schwierig. Du kannst es ihm aber mit einer bzw mehreren verständnisvollen Ansagen leichter machen, mit dir darüber zu reden. Wunder dich nicht, dass er erstmal zumacht wenn du ihn ansprichst (wenn du ihn darauf ansprichst und ihm sagst, dass du weisst was er tut, dir Sorgen machst und ihm versicherst, dass du ihn nicht verurteilst und auch nicht böse bist) und es wieder und wieder verneint und leugnet. Das kann dauern, aber ich denke irgendwann wird er erkennen, dass du ihm nichts böses willst und dann erkennt er vielleicht auch selber, was er da tut.

Ich kann nur aus eigener Erfahrung sprechen, ich habe meine Opiatsucht lange verheimlicht obwohl mich schon Leute angesprochen haben, meine Eltern schon was vermutet haben etc., aber keiner wollte es WIRKLICH ansprechen. Bis meine Mutter Spritzen gefunden hat und ich daraufhin alles offengelegt habe.

Die Sucht ist eine fiese Krankheit. Fies in dem Sinne, dass man als Süchtiger anfangs nicht wahrhaben will, dass man ein Problem hat (hat ja davor so lange Spass gemacht und funktioniert) wenn man täglich harte Drogen konsumiert. Fies auch in vielen anderen Sinnen, Sucht schleicht sich an, man wird langsam süchtig, es ist ein fließender Übergang von ""Ich nehme zum Spass jene Substanzen weil sie mir gefallen"" zur Abhängigkeit. Oder fies auch im Sinne, dass man seine Liebsten belügt und betrügt und beklaut, weil man gierig oder süchtig nach der Substanz ist, glaub mir, kein Süchtiger macht das einfach so... wenn man zB Bekannte beklaut und nicht gerade empathielos ist, bereut man alles spätestens wenn man wieder konsumiert, man weint und ärgert sich unglaublich was aus einem geworden ist... die Hölle, man macht Sachen, die man eigentlich niemals machen würde, wäre da nicht dieses Verlangen, das sich übermächtig über alles andere legt.

Es muss übrigens aber nicht sein, dass er schon süchtig ist nur weil er sich etwas spritzt! Vielleicht ist er grade dabei, eine Sucht zu entwickeln, dann ist es verdammt schwierig für dich, weil er vielleicht selber noch nichts schlimmes darin sieht. Aber auch wenn er nicht süchtig ist, er ist dein Mitbewohner, und du musst es nicht tolerieren, dass er sich in deiner Wohnung Substanzen spritzt. Vermutlich auch mit ein Grund, warum er es ums verrecken vor dir verheimlichen möchte. Weil er Angst hat, dass du komplett arg reagierst, vielleicht hat er Angst, dass du dann Welle machst und es seinen Freunden/Bekannten/Verwandten erzählst... es gibt so viele Gründe. 3-MMC, 4-MMC, Kokain, Speed, das alles sind übrigens sehr aufputschende Substanzen, die auch noch dazu paranoid machen können, also können auch irrationale Ängste bei ihm entstehen.

Ich muss dazusagen, dass es auch absolut auf die Substanz ankommt, die er am öftesten konsumiert. Ich würde nicht vonnhauptsächlichem 3-MMC Konsum ausgehen, nur weil er das bestellt hat. Es ist ziemlich sicher, dass er anderen Drogen aufgeschlossen ist und sie auch konsumiert. Es is zB ein großer Unterschied, wenn er Opiatsüchtig ist, oder ein Cathinon wie 3-MMC täglich konsumiert. Oder Kokain intravenös, auch das wird ihm nicht fremd sein, wenn er tatsächlich 3-MMC schon spritzt. Diese (Upper-)Abhängigkeiten unterscheiden sich aber stark von (Downer-)Abhängigkeiten wie Opiate (Heroin, Morphin, Codein, Oxycodon, etc etc...) oder Benzodiazepine (Valium, Xanax, Rohypnol, Rivotril etc...). Die Upper machen vielmehr Ultra-Extrem-Gierig als körperlich Abhängig. Ein IV Kokain oder MMC Konsument ist immer gierig nach dem nächsten Schuss und tut alles dafür ihn zu bekommen. Geht ihm aber die Kraft oder das Geld aus, legt er sich schlafen, hat dann vl einen Kater, aber es geht ihm sonst gut. Opiate wie Heroin oder Benzos MUSS man konsumieren wenn man abhängig ist, weil es einem sonst dreckig geht, körperlich uns psychisch. Darum ist es bei letzteren keine Option, es dem Süchtigen zB einfach wegzunehmen. Bei Kokain/MMC wird die Person vermutlich extrem wütend und aufgeregt wenn man es wegnimmt, aber sie hat keine Schmerzen. Und wenn jemand Uppers konsumiert, speziell in extremer Form wie Spritzen, ob es nun Koks, MMC oder Meth oder was auch immer ist, wird er auch schonmal etwas zum runterkommen genommen haben, und das sind Opiate oder Benzos. Und Opiate zB, wenn einem die gefallen, dann kanns mit der körperlichen Abhängigkeit schnell gehen.

Naja, langer Text, hab ziemlich ausgeholt, ich will nur noch sagen, ich habe alles genommen, besonders 5 Jahre lang gespritzt was man sich spritzen kann, bin aber letztendlich nur von Opiaten abhängig geblieben. Kokain etc wurde immer schnell anstrengend. Ist von Person zu Person unterschiedlich, und hier auch unwichtig. Ich will nur unterstreichen, dass ich weiß wovon ich rede. Ist aber letztendlich nur meine Meinung/Vermutung/Empfehlung, wie gesagt, schwieriges Thema und es kommt ganz drauf an, was, wieviel und warum er konsumiert.

Rede mit ihm, mach anfangs kein zu großes Thema draus und bleib sein Freund, auch wenn er mal Scheisse baut. Natürlich musst du dir nix gefallen lassen, oder noch schlimmer, dich ausnutzen lassen, aber das wird auch nicht so schnell passieren, wenn er dein Freund ist.

Viel Glück!",1

319,2021-02-10 15:52:11+00:00,"Hi, how are you? I don't mind at all. I suffered with Chronic Pancreatitis and a badly damaged gall bladder (that was removed last year) but I've been in and out of hospital constantly for years with a pain that'd make Satan himself question his very being. Morphine doesn't even dull it. I've also been on Oxyconton and Oxynorm for years, so the struggle with coming off those will start in a month or so.

I know thats more than what you asked, but just thought I'd give a minor detailed account for you",10
320,2021-02-10 14:57:27+00:00,"Honestly, smoking weed is pretty awesome. But i highly recommend not doing it. I know that sounds weird but let me explain.

Weed has this astonishing ability to make you content. It will literally make you content sitting around and doing nothing productive. It will give you a calm euphoria thats very pleasant, and if you do it on the daily, which you will be tempted to do, it will cause real problems in your life.

I cant even begin to tell you how easy it is to turn to weed as a kind of escape from mental health issues you may be going through. It makes you feel calm and content and you just dont care really. Days and days and days will go by and, instead of actively working to improve your health and life, you might just find yourself sitting around getting stoned, eating and playing video games or watching south park. 

Then when it gets to the point where your quality if life starts to really go downhill, then and only then you might recognize that weed is not improving your life at all. But its hard to even see that, because its physically harmless and makes you feel so good. But it can be truly insidious because it can make you squander so much time and miss out on what really makes life worth living. It can have a negative effect on your work, your relationships, your motivation, your fitness, your diet, everything. 

Weed makes you content with being bored, and that leads to all sorts of problems. I used to be a major pothead, so believe me i know. Back in the day i literally spent entire months stoned, i mean not sober ever, from the moment i woke up until the moment i went to bed everyday. You dont wanna be like that. Weed ccan make you kind of a zombie, and its easy to abuse especially if youre dealing with any mental health issues.

It certainly has its place for those with real medical issues, but it should not be turned to recreationally in my opinion. Think of it like opiates. You wouldnt (i hope) pop oxycotin for the fun of it, because it can ruin your life. But some people really do need oxy for legitimate medical reasons. Think of weed the same way, and stay away from it.

Do what you want, but im speaking from experience, and i dont recommend a weed habit at all.",1

Because it is illegal for him to do so and you stating it is your body your decision is meaningless in light of that.

Understand - this is not an argument about morals.  Morally you are asking an important question that is absolutely critical we publicly debate.

You are asking a legal question about laws and the likelyhood legal obligations of the people assisting you - that is rather cut and dry and would need to be changed.",1

I've never met my dad.  My mom tried to kill herself when I was ten by cutting herself and I had to help her stop the bleeding because she was afraid I would be taken away from her if she called 911.  My best friend killed himself when I was in the 8th grade.  When I went to university I had no money and ended up dropping out to help my mom who was in an abusive relationship and was given ~6 months to live due to a failing liver that resulted from an oxycotin addiction stemming from a car accident she was in and a doctor who lost his license for over prescribing narcotics. 


But these are just some of the sad parts of my life.  I have a roof over my head, a wife that loves me, and most important, the ability to see the good things in life.  

If you're having a hard time than I would suggest finding something small that brings you joy.  For me that was hiking.  I find when I'm out in nature it brings home the fact that I am very small in the grand scheme of things and that beauty and happiness are things to be found, not given.

If you're a law enforcement officer and you approach a car, the first thing you do is ask to see the suspects hands. For OBVIOUS reasons. They told him they wanted to cuff him and he didn't comply with that either. He protested his innocence, and it took two officers just to get his hands behind his back and cuff him.

They were law enforcement officers enacting procedural standards when facing a potential threat. It's unclear whether George's death was related to the Fentayl use.

Let's go from the stage where you have the MScontin dissolved in warm salty water.  There should be no lumps or flecks of the gooey stuff left at all.   Draw the liquid up into the syringe and get rid of any air, as you would with a shot.  It's not as critical but for safety's sake you might as well.  You need to put a little lubricant on the syringe barrel, e.g. KY jelly or any kind of water-based lube intended for sex.  Some people prefer coconut oil.  Smear this sparingly on the syringe.  Remove your trousers &amp; underwear, lie on your side and lift the top leg.  Put a little bit of lube/coconut oil on your bumhole too, just a little.  Relax your bumhole muscles and gently insert the syringe about 3cm into your bum and slowly push the plunger in, don't squirt it in .  Some people prefer to lie still but the most absorbent membrane is just on the inside of the entrance to the rectum so you might want to sit up a little bit after you have gently wihdrawn the syringe, maybe lean forward a little as you do this to be sure none of the liquid runs out of your bum.  The Hepatic Portal vein branches out around the rectum, carrying the morphine into your bloodstream quite quickly, you should start to feel it within 5 minutes",1

You only need water that is warm to the hands for this job but it needs keeping warm for best dissolving effect or it will take well over an hour.  The more liquid it is the better it is for boofing, you don't want any goo as it will interferewith the morphine getting into your bloodstream. I gave this same advice to a guy last week who had some of the morphine  'XR' capsules and hadn't treated them properly before boofing, but after he used the heat &amp; salt, he called it a 'game changer' and even though he farted some of it out it had a far more powerful effect on him, he was surprised at the difference.

Basically we are collecting daily data- how much you micro dose, how many times/off and on- your health issues and what has it helped, how long....did it not help anything or you don’t feel it has.  Side effects, etc.?  Why?

We are starting a non-profit group.  So for example someone with your illness can easily figure out what MG works usually for their sex, height and weight along with information such as caffeine intake, alcohol, etc.  You can remain anonymous with our study.  We provide you with a month of forms and you just fill it out once a day.  What you fill out after the initial form will take you a minute or two.  Initial form is ten minutes.  Then at end of month it would take about ten minutes.

Your only doing this to help others who want to help themselves.  We aren’t selling the data. And it will be vetted.  

As far as MD itself, since there are new laws taking effect daily we propose offering microdosing of mushrooms and/or ketamine.  But our program :
1. Isn’t just to get money from you.  Doctors are charging way to much money even if you go to the cheapest.

We have doctors who will monitor the program but it will be more citizen guide oriented.

Quick example...
The cheapest company online that sells Ketamine sells it sublingual and you can have it shipped to you and have the experience at home.  It’s great compared to Spravato.  And who wants to take Spravato which is overpriced and sit in a doctor office for up to 2 hours.  That in itself is boring.

Spravato:
$780 for medicine
$1000-$3000 doctor bills insurance company

Depending on your income and insurance you can pay $0 or almost the entire amount and Spravato sucks.  Did it for a year and it works but you have to take it twice a week 112mg and it takes over your entire life or having to go there, etc.

Found company that does online Ketamine sublingual.  $1000 for first month $600 years each additional.  I wouldn’t go into their negatives because I know they monitor this board and not going to give their CEO valuable onsite on what they are missing.

But if you compare them of having to get an IV for $300-$900 a visit then obviously getting it shipped to your home is the best.

Our point is...why are they charging so much??

Because they can get away with it because the FDA will not recognize microdosing because it works and it would destroy bigpharma

Instead of say let’s taking pain medication like Oxycotin every month which costs your insurance $2000-$2500 a month; wouldn’t you rather take something natural like mushrooms?

We are planning on providing monthly doses of mushrooms for $125.

So would like your input privately or here.

Like they go down to my belly button. I also have a skin condition called Morphea that's on my boobs, stomach, hips, neck, armpits and back (like half my body tbh) that basically darkens my skin to a dark brown color and I'm a very fair person. It just makes me look really really weird. 

Because of all that I used to absolutely hate myself and the way I looked when we first started dating. I was so scared to even tell him about my skin condition because its the weirdest thing and so hard to explain especially to someone who doesn't have it and its so easily visible if I take off my clothes. So I had all this body image stuff to worry about including my boobs. I was terrified of judgement and him possibly thinking I was gross. He loved me anyways and reassured and encouraged me whenever he could. Even after like a year of dating I still felt uncomfortable with him seeing my boobs as I was getting dressed and things like that. 

I am much better now and am pretty comfortable with my body but that took 3 years of active work on myself and constantly reassuring myself that I'm worthy of love no matter what my body looks like. I recently had surgery and now have a big scar right above my collarbone in the same spot where my skin is discolored from my skin disease. And I'm eventually going to have a matching one on my other side too. But this time I barely even care and kind of like the scar. And its insane to me that that's the case because I was the teenager that actively hid the skin disease I got for months from my parents when it first developed because I was so embarrassed about it without even knowing what it was.

Sorry I kind of ranted here. I just used to be so horribly embarrassed about anything having to deal with my boobs or my body not looking or feeling like anyone's my age. I absolutely hated myself and I still don't like to look at myself in the mirror shirtless most of the time. But I understand how you feel. I'm sorry I can't offer great advice.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

382,2021-02-02 23:03:27+00:00," O Itamaraty publicou uma nota diplomática nesta terça-feira (2) em que não se refere ao golpe de Estado em [Myanmar ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/02/entenda-como-foi-dado-o-golpe-de-estado-em-mianmar.shtml)como golpe, nem menciona opositores presos pela junta militar, entre eles a vencedora do prêmio Nobel da Paz [Aung San Suu Kyi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/02/sem-aura-de-heroina-suu-kyi-encara-o-velho-normal-com-golpe-em-mianmar.shtml), líder civil de facto do país.

 Na nota, o ministério afirma que acompanha “atentamente os desdobramentos da decretação do estado de emergência em Myanmar” e diz que o Brasil tem a expectativa de “um rápido retorno do país à normalidade democrática e de preservação do estado de direito.”

  Militares derrubaram o governo democrático do país asiático na segunda-feira (1), e prendeu Aung San Suu Kyi, o presidente do país, autoridades e políticos da oposição.

 Os Estados Unidos determinaram formalmente nesta terça que a tomada de poder pelos militares configura um “golpe de estado”, uma designação que exige que o país corte toda sua ajuda externa à nação asiática. ""Depois de cuidadosa análise dos fatos, nós chegamos à conclusão que Aung San Suu Kyi, a líder do partido governante em Myanmar, foi deposta em um golpe militar em 1 de fevereiro”, disse um porta-voz do Departamento de Estado a repórteres. “Exortamos que a liderança militar de Myanmar liberte todos os integrantes da sociedade civil e políticos líderes imediatamente.”

 Indagado se considera a tomada de poder em Myanmar um golpe militar, o Itamaraty afirmou apenas esperar “um rápido retorno do país à normalidade democrática e de preservação do estado de direito”, repetindo a linguagem da nota.

  Segundo diplomatas, o Itamaraty, por tradição, não interfere em assuntos internos de outros países e, por isso, não usa termos fortes como golpe e presos políticos.

 No entanto, em notas diplomáticas sobre a Venezuela e Bolívia, por exemplo, o ministério usou linguagem assertiva. “A repulsa popular após a tentativa de estelionato eleitoral (constatada pela OEA), o qual favoreceria Evo Morales, levou à sua deslegitimação como presidente e consequente clamor de amplos setores da sociedade boliviana por sua renúncia”, disse o Itamaraty em nota de 12 de novembro de 2019, ao negar que a deposição de Morales tivesse sido um “golpe”. E continua: “A renúncia de Evo Morales abriu caminho para a preservação da ordem democrática, a qual se veria ameaçada pela permanência no poder de um presidente beneficiado por fraude eleitoral.”

 Sobre a ditadura na Venezuela, em nota do Grupo de Lima de abril de 2019, o Itamaraty pedia a “liberação imediata dos presos políticos”.

 A nota é alvo de críticas de entidades de direitos humanos.

 “A Constituição brasileira determina que, na condução das relações internacionais, deve haver prevalência dos direitos humanos"", disse Juana Kweitel, diretora executiva da Conectas Direitos Humanos. ""A nota oficial do Itamaraty sobre a situação em Mianmar, ao não condenar o golpe militar nem a prisão de ativistas e vozes contrárias, vai na contramão dessa determinação constitucional.”",1

A morte foi anunciada em sua conta no Twitter.

 Moore,100, havia sido tratado de pneumonia nas últimas semanas e recebeu o diagnóstico de coronavírus no mês passado, segundo sua filha, Hannah Ingram-Moore, publicou no Twitter em 31 de janeiro. Ele[ foi levado a um hospital](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/celebridades/2021/02/aos-100-anos-capitao-britanico-tom-moore-e-hospitalizado-com-covid-19.shtml) porque precisava de ajuda para respirar, disse ela, e sua condição se deteriorou.

 Elegante, ágil e bem-humorado, Moore encantou todo o Reino Unido com 82 passos de cada vez —o número necessário para percorrer um pátio de tijolos ao lado de seu jardim em Marston Moretaine, aldeia a uma hora ao norte de Londres. Ele deu a centésima volta antes de [completar 100 anos em abril](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/voceviu/2020/05/heroi-britanico-que-arrecadou-milhoes-para-saude-ganha-festa-especial-nos-100-anos.shtml).

 A [façanha de Moore](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/voceviu/2020/04/britanico-de-99-anos-entra-no-guinness-devido-a-arrecadacoes-contra-o-coronavirus.shtml), que surgiu de um desafio de seu genro, tornou-se uma sensação na mídia quando Ingram-Moore publicou as caminhadas do pai e lançou uma campanha online para levantar fundos para o NHS (o serviço público de saúde do Reino Unido). Com doadores que incluem o príncipe William, que o chamou de ""uma máquina de levantar fundos"", Moore rapidamente angariou 32,8 milhões de libras.

 No processo, Moore se tornou um fenômeno da cultura pop. Suas caminhadas foram transmitidas pelos canais de TV BBC, CNN, NBC e Al Jazeera, e seu rosto passou a frequentar a primeira página dos tabloides britânicos. Esses jornais o apelidaram de Capitão Tom, sua patente militar até que ele foi nomeado coronel honorário pelo Army Foundation College.

  Ele negociou um acordo para vários livros, gravou uma canção que chegou ao topo das paradas e [recebeu o título de cavaleiro da rainha Elizabeth 2ª, que saiu do isolamento pela primeira vez](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/rainha-deixa-confinamento-para-homenagear-idoso-que-arrecadou-doacoes-contra-a-covid-19.shtml) desde o início da pandemia [para conferir a honraria](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/voceviu/2020/05/veterano-de-guerra-de-100-anos-recebe-condecoracao-da-rainha-apos-arrecadar-32-milhoes.shtml) no Castelo de Windsor em julho.

 Aos 94, a rainha formou um par notável com Moore —elos vivos com a história britânica na Segunda Guerra Mundial, que foi invocada durante a pandemia como exemplo da coragem e do estoicismo de que o país precisa hoje.

 Quando ainda era princesa, Elizabeth trabalhou como motorista e mecânica de caminhões durante a guerra, e Moore foi um oficial do Exército condecorado que lutou na dura campanha da então Birmânia (atual Mianmar).

 Os últimos dias de Moore foram ligeiramente marcados pelas críticas a uma viagem que ele e sua família fizeram à ilha de Barbados, no Caribe, em dezembro. Algumas pessoas foram às redes sociais para questionar por que um homem de 100 anos tiraria férias no exterior em uma época em que o governo desencorajava tais viagens por causa da pandemia.

 Os defensores de Moore salientaram que o voo, que foi pago pela British Airways, aconteceu antes de o primeiro-ministro Boris Johnson endurecer as regras de lockdown na Inglaterra, em 19 de dezembro, depois que cientistas detectaram uma nova variante do vírus que se espalhava rapidamente.

 Não há evidências de que Moore adoeceu durante a viagem. Em 18 de dezembro, ele apareceu em uma foto postada em sua página no Twitter usando shorts, com a legenda ""Desfrutando um lindo dia com a família ao sol de Barbados"".

 Nascido em Keighley, uma aldeia em Yorkshire, numa família de construtores, Moore estudou engenharia civil. Em 1940, aos 20, foi convocado e destinado ao regimento do duque de Wellington. Estacionado primeiramente na Cornualha, no sudoeste da Inglaterra, ele foi escolhido para treinamento de oficiais e mobilizado na Índia. Treinou recrutas indianos a pilotar motocicletas, paixão que adquiriu quando menino e o acompanhou por toda a vida.

 Mais tarde, Moore foi enviado à Birmânia. Durante seu tempo lá, os britânicos montaram um contra-ataque aos ocupantes japoneses em uma região costeira hoje conhecida como Rakhine. Era a guerra na selva, contra um inimigo feroz em condições deploráveis, cheia de doenças tropicais e insetos.

 ""Se você tirasse a jaqueta à noite para pendurá-la, de manhã teria de sacudi-la para remover as aranhas e outras criaturas"", disse Moore em uma entrevista ao jornal The New York Times em maio.

 Mas ele acrescentou: ""Não me lembro de sentir medo naquela época"".

 Moore voltou para casa depois da guerra e construiu uma vida confortável como gerente de uma empresa de concreto. Ele continuou enérgico até o fim dos 90 anos, cortando a grama do jardim, cuidando de uma estufa e dirigindo seu carro. Mas dois anos atrás ele caiu na cozinha, quebrou o quadril e uma costela e perfurou um pulmão.

 Sua hospitalização lhe deu um grande apreço pelos médicos e enfermeiros do NHS. Enquanto o serviço enfrentava o aumento do fluxo de pacientes de coronavírus na última primavera, angariar dinheiro para sua equipe em dificuldades pareceu uma causa digna.

 ""Nunca em cem anos, quando começamos, previmos que essa soma de dinheiro seria levantada"", disse Moore.

 Parte do dinheiro que ele recebeu está sendo usada para criar instalações terapêuticas para médicos e enfermeiros descontraírem depois do trabalho tratando pacientes de Covid. Moore disse que via essa iniciativa como um modo de apoiar os trabalhadores de saúde, como ele se lembrava que os britânicos apoiaram a ele e seus companheiros soldados durante a guerra.

 ""Naquela época, as pessoas da minha idade lutávamos na linha de frente e o público em geral ficava atrás de nós"", disse Moore. ""Neste caso, os médicos e enfermeiros e todo o pessoal médico estão na linha de frente. Cabe à minha geração apoiá-los, assim como nos apoiaram.""

 Mesmo depois de completar 100 anos, Moore não perdeu o senso de aventura. Além de Barbados, ele manifestou o desejo de voltar à Índia.

 ""É algo que eu adoraria fazer, mas aos 100..."", disse, ""você tem uma certa limitação de tempo.""",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it.

[You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul)

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

 O golpe devolve o país ao pleno regime militar depois de uma curta experiência de quase democracia que começou em 2011, quando os militares, que estavam no poder desde 1962, implementaram eleições parlamentares e outras reformas.

 

  

### O que levou ao golpe militar em Mianmar?

 O Parlamento tinha marcado para esta semana sua primeira sessão desde as eleições em 8 de novembro, quando a Liga Nacional para a Democracia (LND), principal partido civil do país, ganhou 83% do assentos disponíveis no órgão.

 Os militares se recusaram a aceitar os resultados da votação, que foi amplamente considerada um referendo sobre a popularidade de Aung San Suu Kyi, chefe da LND, que foi [a líder civil de fato do país](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/02/sem-aura-de-heroina-suu-kyi-encara-o-velho-normal-com-golpe-em-mianmar.shtml) desde que assumiu o cargo, em 2015.

 O novo Parlamento deveria endossar os resultados da eleição e aprovar o próximo governo de Mianmar.

  A possibilidade de golpe surgiu nos últimos dias. Os militares, que tinham tentado afirmar na Suprema Corte do país que os resultados da eleição foram fraudados, ameaçaram entrar em ação e cercaram as casas do Parlamento com soldados.

 ### Como o golpe foi efetuado?

 Os militares detiveram na segunda-feira os líderes do partido governante, LND, e a liderança civil de Mianmar, incluindo Suu Kyi e o presidente Win Myint, juntamente com ministros de gabinete, os ministros-chefes de várias regiões, políticos de oposição, escritores e ativistas.

 O golpe foi anunciado efetivamente no canal de TV Myawaddy, de propriedade dos militares, quando um apresentador citou a Constituição de 2008, que permite que as Forças Armadas declarem emergência nacional. O estado de emergência, disse ele, ficará em vigor durante um ano.

 Os militares rapidamente tomaram o controle da infraestrutura do país, suspendendo a maioria das emissões de televisão e cancelando todos os voos domésticos e internacionais, segundo relatos.

 O acesso a telefones e à internet foi suspenso nas grandes cidades. O mercado de ações e os bancos comerciais foram fechados, e longas filas se formaram diante de caixas eletrônicos em alguns lugares.

 Em Yangon, a maior cidade do país e sua antiga capital, os moradores correram para supermercados para armazenar comida e outros suprimentos.

 ### Quem é Aung San Suu Kyi?

 Suu Kyi chegou ao poder como conselheira de Estado em 2016, depois da primeira eleição totalmente democrática em Mianmar em décadas.

 Sua ascensão à liderança foi considerada um momento crítico na transição do país antes conhecido como Birmânia, da ditadura militar para a democracia. Suu Kyi, filha do herói da independência, o general Aung San, [passou mais de 15 anos em prisão domiciliar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u599770.shtml).

 Seu tempo em detenção a transformou em um ícone internacional, e [ela ganhou o Prêmio Nobel da Paz](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u713375.shtml) em 1991.

  

 Desde que foi libertada, sua reputação foi manchada por ter cooperado com os militares e defendido com veemência a mortífera campanha contra os rohingya, um grupo étnico minoritário muçulmano. Em 2019, Suu Kyi representou o país em um julgamento no Tribunal Penal Internacional, no qual defendeu Mianmar das acusações de violência étnica.

 Muitos acreditavam que a cooperação de Suu Kyi com os militares fosse uma medida pragmática para acelerar a evolução do país para a plena democracia. Mas sua detenção na segunda parece provar a que o compromisso dos militares com a democracia era falso.

 ### Quem é o general Aung Hlaing?

 Os militares disseram que entregaram o poder ao chefe do Exército, o idoso general Aung Hlaing, que deveria se aposentar neste verão. Sua rede de patrocínio, centrada em lucrativas empresas familiares, pode ter sido minada por sua aposentadoria, especialmente se ele não conseguisse garantir uma saída limpa.

 Sob o acordo anterior de partilha de poder, Hlaing presidia dois conglomerados empresariais e podia indicar três cargos chaves de gabinete que supervisionam a polícia e a guarda de fronteiras.

 Os militares nunca caíram sob o controle do governo civil. Em anos recentes, o Exército, com Hlaing no comando, supervisionou [campanhas contra vários grupos étnicos minoritários do país](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/09/soldados-de-mianmar-confessam-limpeza-etnica-de-rohingyas-diz-nyt.shtml), incluindo os rohingya, os shan e os kokang.

But I think they fake pills are here cause the European drug market changed a bit and people want to try these mbox 30s from the US, you know it's always trendy to use what the Americans use, you can say they are a bit of a trendsetter. But I don't think that fent will get as popular here in Europe as it is in the US and Canada. Just because of the fact that all the opium producing country's produce alot of Heroin and opium there won't be hopefully the change to fent. But also let's say 30-40% of the opioid addicts want smth stronger than Heroin they switch to fent especially if they are in bupe or mdone substitution. And yes you can be right that maybe they can't send these pills to the US and Canada so they thought let's push them to Europe. Also in my country the rap game changed the drug game also a bit, a few years back it was all codeine here and there, now they start talking about Tilidin and oxy and now the ""cool kids"" want to try these drugs too and also the fact that the Americans rapping about oxy 30s,the kids wanna do them too. And, at least in my country, there are no 30s, we got 10, 15, 20, 40, 60 and 80mg oxys. I also never seen 30s at the Darknet vendors from Europe. But yes I have now seen a few, especially UK vendors selling fake 30s, and also a few ones selling, pain pills with an oxycodon analogues, I asked the vendor and he said it's a fent analogues but he uses oxy cause the ppl know it more which is definitely true but not fair advertisement. But the majority of European vendors who sell fent advertise it as fent, also all the street dealers do so, so I am not scarred of buying fent laced H atm. Fent is for the European market smth special, the same like pure/not fent laced Heroin is smth special for the USA/Canada market. And I don't think that Heroin will get pushed away from fent on the European market like it did in the US, just because of the fact that all the opium country's are so near to us. And also I think the main point why all the fent now shows up in the UK is because it is not anymore in the EU. Brexit may have destroyed your drug market.

And in men:

Atopic dermatitis, diabetes

I'm sure there are more. I hope you find some answers and solutions for what's going on!",2

427,2021-01-31 22:59:30+00:00,"Thank you. The weird thing is it was 320ng/L for morphine and below the threshold for oxy and synthetic opiates at their lab. When they sent it to the national lab, it wasn’t high for natural opiates but sky high through the roof for oxy. The lab tech said that it was so high it may have canceled out the positive for morphene. This has never been seen before by anyone in my drug court that I’ve spoken to so far. Why didn’t it test positive for oxy at their lab?  I passed probation Urine test two days prior, a pre employment screen the previous day and another test the following Tuesday (the test was on a Friday). I didn’t use any illegal drugs and I stand by that. I’m baffled.",1

What's stopping him from embedding them in Confederate flags, MAGA hats, credit cards, cowboy boots, every foreign and domestic car/truck/SUV, Oxycotin pill, Tylenol, M&amp;M's, tortilla chips (it literally has ""chips"" in the name), pumpkin spice latte and camo kevlar vests?",1
429,2021-01-31 22:16:15+00:00,Yeah they worked the same but I've found out they are definitely not right. Sucks. It's not fetanyl. It has a taste but it's not similar to the n 23 I have. So they are definitely not right. Guess here's a warning to people there's some semi good presses of these going around.,1
