0,2020-03-31 19:29:35+00:00,"I love reading birth stories, so I figured I'd post my own.
So basically my original due date was 3/4/20 and I was scheduled to go in that day to be induced, however I had bronchitis really bad so we rescheduled for the next week, I was kind of disappointed because 4 is kind of a lucky number for me but I was in no condition to labor even though I was already 2cm and 60% effaced(second child). So anyways I thought maybe I'd go into labor on my own but of course it never came. So on the morning of my induction, my husband and I go in at 8am, get checked and I'm already at 4cm. So let me say my nurse was super sweet and nice and a little ditzy, she could not get my IV and poked my 3 times, to the point that my husband asked if he could give it to me(learned in the military) she called in the charge nurse who got it in the first try. So since I was already dilating they didn't need to give me Cervadil or anything, they immediately started me on pitocin, which was fine for a while. I was feeling fine until about 1:30 pm and the contractions were becoming really painful at this point. So I asked for the epidural. I waited and waited as the contractions got worse and worse. My nurse let me know that because of multiple emergencies because of bike week that she wasn't able to get me an  epidural and felt extremely bad, she instead gave me a shot of fentayl which did nothing for me at all. Than about 20 minutes later she comes in all excited as they were able to get someone to administer it. Now since this was my second time, I figured it'd be easy peasy like my first one, guy came in and got in and done in under and hour, so this is what I was expecting. Boy was I wrong. This lady was HORRIBLE. And it had already been 2 hours since I asked for one and my  contractions were REALLY PAINFUL at this point and I was at 7cm dilated. So this lady starts and can't get me numb so I can feel her poking around on my left side, it took her 2 hours before she got the catheter set in my back, which during those two hours I had to sit still through horrible contractions and something in my broke and I just broke down crying while trying to sit still, my nurse felt so bad, and this fucking ladies phone rings and she actually asked my husband to check it for her, he was appalled and just ignored her. So she's getting upset and says that she can't do it and maybe ""we should just find someone else to give me the epidural "" like wtf, I just kept crying. So she finally sets it and they begin administering it and I realize I can still 100% feel my left side, and can still feel the contractions on that side, so my nurse is trying everything to position me so it would work. Finally it starts to work but I can still move and lift my legs and everything but luckily not feel the contractions anymore. By this point its already 440pm.  So the nurse checks me at about 530 and I'm already at 9cm, I tell my husband to go get food so I can eat after delivery, he goes and the nurse comes and puts the peanut ball between my legs and tells me if I feel pressure like I need to poop to call her in, so within like 3 minutes I feel the pressure but try to ignore it because my husband isn't back yet, she comes in and says that the monitor is going nuts, checks me and says oh it definitely time to go, I call my husband and tell him to get back up here NOW, he just ordered the food and said fuck it and left it lolz. She comes up and they tell me that we're going to do a few ""practice"" pushes. After one practice push, she and the doctor immediately call in the birthing team. This a as at 6pm. So they come in and at this point I can already feel everything, (which I couldn't my first pregnancy) so I start pushing and the doctor tells me she can already see his head,  and at 6:07 he was out. They immediately handed him to me for skin to skin, but he was very purple and not crying, so they take him for a few minutes and he get all the liquid and crap out of his mouth and nose, and after a few minutes, everything is good and they hand him to me, I was so happy",1

16,2020-03-30 22:00:42+00:00,"Thank you this is helpful. I've come to the overall conclusion (from all of you guys answering which i appreciate SO much especially because you've all been helpful and theres been only nice and helpful replies and no like, mean or shaming ones it helps so much knowing people do want to help) that yes, I will have to wait longer and also take a smaller dose. I do believe that it was from taking to much, I should defiantly ask to be started out at a very small dose and go on from there. I don't think I have ever waited longer than 2 days, so maybe yes I should wait longer for it to work right. 
   And as I had said somewhere its unfortunately yes mainly all fetanyl is all there really is where I live I believe my last drug test I didn't even have heroin or anything else in my system, purely fetanyl and is such a huge reason why I'm trying to do this I've lost someone who I was really close to recently and I just dont want that to be me.. I don't want my family to feel the pain I had felt. It just isn't worth it. 
    Even if the doctors don't believe that I haven't used or whatever, I'm still going to let them know everything happening, my concerns and to go over all of my options. 
    I know the 2 are different but I always get them confused or forget why, which is which etc, so I wasn't sure if maybe trying the other would be a better option. I'm thinking that I should just wait an extra day or 2, so 3 or 4 days all together, and still take a smaller dose of the same medication. The hot skin was the beginning of the symptoms starting and I've heard that it passes and then you feel okay after but it never passed and got worse, about 5 minutes in is when the rest of them came back. So I'm thinking you're right that I took to high of a mg.

19,2020-03-30 21:19:18+00:00,"Subutex isn't the same as Suboxone, there is no Naloxone in Subutex. So you aren't likely having withdrawal symptoms from starting too early. The feeling really hot you are describing, is a symptom of taking too much. 8mg is not a tiny amount, and it may be too much for you. Try 2-4mg next time and see if you feel any better

Edit: In my personal opinion, I believe addicts do much better with Suboxone long term and I rarely see Subutex prescribed as often anymore (usually only for pregnant women or in the case of using just for induction) because of the potential for abuse.

Edit 2: Realized from reading other comments that your drug of choice was Fetanyl and that you described the feeling as being worse than any withdrawal you've felt. In this case, it may be possible you're feeling withdrawal symptoms and may need to wait longer before trying. From skimming it did appear to sound like you may have taken too much, but now I'm not so sure.",2

De um lado, muitas pessoas com gestos de empatia e solidariedade, do outro, outras tantas com atos de ego√≠smo, falta de compaix√£o.

 ""Falta total empatia. √â uma coisa absolutamente autorreferente. √â a n√£o compaix√£o. Quem elogia a tortura, quem admira torturador, n√£o se coloca no lugar do outro"", afirma ela, tamb√©m documentarista e doutora em artes pela USP.

 Segundo Chnaiderman, esse √© o momento em que todos os fantasmas internos se concretizam. ""A realidade √© de fato amea√ßadora, n√£o √© mais a tua fantasia, a tua paranoia, √© uma amea√ßa real. √â a presen√ßa de um inimigo invis√≠vel e que mata. Isso √© muito desorganizador, √© muita ang√∫stia.""

 ""Fazer coisas que em geral a gente n√£o tem tempo para fazer, como ler poesia, contos, escutar m√∫sica, escrever, fazer di√°rios e contar sobre essa experi√™ncia. As pessoas t√™m feito festas online, dan√ßam, inclusive. Podem transar online tamb√©m. Deve dar um refresco. A sa√∫de mental vem disso, de saber suportar esse momento"", afirma.

       

 **Como a empatia pode ajudar a passar pela pandemia do novo coronav√≠rus?** S√≥ empatia junto com a solidariedade √© capaz de nos mover e nos ajudar a superar todas as restri√ß√µes que est√£o sendo impostas. A gente n√£o escolheu isso.[ As pessoas se sentem violentadas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/desconhecimento-falta-de-controle-e-xenofobia-alimentam-temor-de-coronavirus.shtml) de n√£o terem escolhido n√£o sair de casa. Mas a gente est√° fazendo isso, acima de tudo, pelo outro.

 O fil√≥sofo Max Scheller (1874-1928) diz que a empatia √© um ato mediante o qual se realizam a percep√ß√£o e compreens√£o do estado de alma de um outro. Por essa raz√£o, condiciona todas as formas de compaix√£o. Para se ter compaix√£o de algu√©m, √© necess√°rio conhecer antes o sofrimento do outro.

 **Esse isolamento social ent√£o √© uma oportunidade para exercer a empatia?** Est√£o acontecendo gestos incr√≠veis, [a empatia que move a vizinhan√ßa toda se mobilizar para comemorar o anivers√°rio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/festas-online-aplacam-isolamento-e-reforcam-lacos-de-amizade-na-quarentena.shtml) de uma senhorinha l√° nos EUA, ou de uma menininha num condom√≠nio aqui de S√£o Paulo. Ou mesmo tudo o que se cria num panela√ßo ou nos aplausos aos funcion√°rios da sa√∫de. Voc√™ precisa se colocar no lugar do outro.

 T√™m coisas muito bonitas acontecendo, vizinhan√ßa se mobilizando, os mais jovens se oferecendo para comprar coisas aos mais velhos.

 √â muito novo isso no Brasil. A gente est√° sendo obrigado a acolher aquilo que n√£o acolhe, como a velhice e a doen√ßa.

 **Por outro lado, aparece tamb√©m o pior do ser humano nesses momentos. Como gente estocando papel higi√™nico ou √°lcool em gel... **Sim, √© uma coisa atroz, total falta de empatia, total ego√≠smo, vou pensar s√≥ em mim, que se arrebente o outro. As pessoas n√£o percebem que se o outro se arrebenta, voc√™ se arrebenta junto tamb√©m.

 Essa coisa do papel higi√™nico, s√≥ a psican√°lise mesmo para interpretar. √â a fantasia de que se voc√™ tiver como limpar aquilo que sai do corpo como sujeira, voc√™ n√£o vai adoecer. √â uma fal√™ncia das media√ß√µes entre os instintos, as puls√µes e o mundo simb√≥lico.

 **Vivemos num pa√≠s de muita desigualdade social, intoler√¢ncia e ataques a minorias. Voc√™ v√™ nessa crise alguma chance de as pessoas reverem valores e comportamentos? **N√£o sei. Depois dessas [falas do presidente Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/bolsonaro-contrariou-orgaos-de-saude-e-distorceu-cenario-sobre-coronavirus-veja-discurso-comentado.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/bolsonaro-contrariou-orgaos-de-saude-e-distorceu-cenario-sobre-coronavirus-veja-discurso-comentado.shtml), soube de bairros onde as pessoas est√£o fazendo campanha para sair para as ruas, para acabar com o isolamento. √â um discurso que exacerba isso tudo.

 T√™m pessoas mobilizadas para ajudar travestis, moradores de rua. Mas essas pessoas que sa√≠ram comprando feito malucas est√£o pensando nelas e pronto. Toda essa quest√£o aparece na postura do presidente de s√≥ pensar nos neg√≥cios e n√£o as pessoas.

 **Falta empatia ao presidente?** Falta total. √â uma coisa absolutamente autorreferente, que quer o poder a todo custo, que pensa s√≥ na reelei√ß√£o. √â o neoliberalismo e o ego√≠smo que ficam em quest√£o com o que est√° acontecendo. √â uma explos√£o de uma coisa terr√≠vel que j√° vinha acontecendo e que se concretiza nessa pandemia.

 Tem muita gente falando numa ruptura no jeito de governar, de conduzir a vida. Se voc√™ n√£o tem o que a gente chama de empatia, se n√£o √© tocado por um mundo que n√£o √© o seu, √© terr√≠vel.

 √â a n√£o compaix√£o. [Quem elogia a tortura, quem admira torturador, n√£o se coloca no lugar do outro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml). As pessoas morrem de medo de se colocar no lugar do outro porque se sentem fr√°geis, se sentem podendo elas degringolarem, de ficarem sem nada.

 **Nessas horas de tanto medo muitos fantasmas saem do arm√°rio, certo?** √â um momento bem delicado porque todos os fantasminhas internos que todos n√≥s temos est√£o concretizados numa realidade. A realidade √© de fato amea√ßadora, n√£o √© mais a tua fantasia, a tua paranoia, √© uma amea√ßa real.

 √â a presen√ßa de um inimigo invis√≠vel e que mata. Isso √© muito desorganizador, √© muita ang√∫stia. As pessoas que eu tenho ouvido n√£o est√£o conseguindo ler, estar com elas mesmas. Ou grudam na televis√£o, na internet, ou ficam limpando a casa o dia todo.

 Atividades como ouvir m√∫sica, ver aquele filme que voc√™ sempre teve vontade, mas n√£o teve tempo est√£o sendo dif√≠ceis de acontecer. Trabalhar com essa ang√∫stia de morte te exaure, te suga. As pessoas n√£o dormem bem.

 **A hist√≥ria mostra que depois de grandes cat√°strofes podem surgir coisas boas. Ap√≥s a peste negra, por exemplo, veio a Renascen√ßa. Pode sair coisa boa depois da pandemia de Covid-19?** Poder, pode. Mas n√£o sei se h√° uma mobiliza√ß√£o para isso. A gente est√° vivendo um destro√ßamento das for√ßas mais libert√°rias, que buscam um mundo de outro jeito.

 Eu vejo como mais poss√≠vel uma como√ß√£o social, as pessoas v√£o ficar sem dinheiro, n√£o v√£o ter o que comer, v√£o ter mudar seus h√°bitos.

 Estamos num momento muito amargo do mundo, de falta de lideran√ßas, de falta de mobiliza√ß√£o. √â meio imprevis√≠vel. S√≥ quem trabalha o sofrimento internamente, pode se identificar com quem sofre.

 [A gente est√° num mundo consumista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/03/combate-ao-consumismo-e-foco-de-programa-educativo.shtml), do prazer imediato, onde ter a capacidade de se identificar com a dor do outro e poder acolher a dor em voc√™ √© considerado fragilidade, voc√™ √© um nada. Porque o objetivo √© o ganho imediato, o prazer imediato.

 De qualquer forma, √© um abalo. A gente vai sair dessa com um √¥nus terr√≠vel. Alguma coisa vai ter que mudar. Tomara que essa solidariedade, essa empatia que temos visto se introduza de fato na sociedade, que seja algo mais duradouro.

 **A verdade √© que todos n√≥s estamos nos sentindo vulner√°veis...** Sim, at√© porque a vulnerabilidade √© uma realidade do ser humano. Todo mundo nega. Quando o presidente chega e fala: 'vai ser uma gripezinha porque eu tenho uma hist√≥ria de atleta', ele se coloca como um ser n√£o vulner√°vel, √© um deus.

 Est√° todo mundo tendo que trabalhar isso em si, algo foi profundamente abalado nessa hist√≥ria toda. Antes, muitas pessoas pensavam: 'Ah! eu vou para Europa, vou para Nova York. Ou vou aproveitar que aqui est√° essa coisa, e vou para a praia'.

Ainda que confundindo botinas com luvas, mulheres e furos, Bolsa e humanidade, o [bolsonarismo ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/janiodefreitas/2020/03/bolsonaro-inaugurou-seu-desgoverno-com-devastacao-do-mais-medicos.shtml)oficial n√£o foi contrastado pela oposi√ß√£o desde a sua posse. Dominou para nada que prestasse, aceito pela passividade proveitosa ou atemorizada diante da in√©pcia amalucada e regressiva. O contraste apareceu. Incipiente, mas j√° capaz de empurrar Bolsonaro e o bolsonarismo para mais pr√≥ximos do seu lugar leg√≠timo.

 √â o aparecimento quase simult√¢neo da lucidez independente no Congresso, h√° algum tempo puxada [por Rodrigo Maia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/janiodefreitas/2020/02/pergunte-sobre-o-futuro-do-brasil-a-rodrigo-maia-e-arminio-fraga.shtml) e, em algumas ocasi√µes, por Davi Alcolumbre; tamb√©m da consci√™ncia ativada em muitos governadores, quase todos, tanto da sua responsabilidade como do seu poder; e, ainda, da marselhesa das panelas, som da opini√£o p√∫blica desalentada.

 Essa combina√ß√£o √© uma for√ßa real, em condi√ß√µes de atenuar o estado ca√≥tico geral e o regressismo social e legal comum aos atos e projetos do governo. N√£o em condi√ß√µes, por√©m, de diminuir a aliena√ß√£o mental de Bolsonaro e dos seus tr√™s orientadores. Dotados de meios de resist√™ncia, como recusa a san√ß√µes, incidentes internacionais, mobiliza√ß√£o de agita√ß√µes com PMs, caminhoneiros, mil√≠cias. O card√°pio √© farto. E, sim ou n√£o, com os militares.

 Nosso falar, a prop√≥sito, precisa corrigir-se. A usual men√ß√£o a militares inclui, al√©m do Ex√©rcito, a Marinha e a Aeron√°utica. Assim tem sido imprecisa e injusta. Marinha e Aeron√°utica t√™m praticado um profissionalismo exemplar. H√° muito tempo, e com mais raz√£o nestes tempos, n√£o se v√™ um almirante ou brigadeiro fazendo considera√ß√µes p√∫blicas de fundo pol√≠tico, nem diretas nem disfar√ßadas.

 As especula√ß√µes de divis√£o e preocupa√ß√µes diversas nos comandos do Ex√©rcito, ou diverg√™ncias da tropa de generais entre si ou com Bolsonaro, em geral n√£o t√™m ind√≠cios aceit√°veis. Escalado ou volunt√°rio para remendar falas de Bolsonaro, o general-vice [Hamilton Mour√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/hamilton-mourao/) vem, sempre, com um ""n√£o se expressou bem"" que, no m√°ximo, traz vaguid√£o. √â o suficiente, por√©m, para mostrar que a corrente do Ex√©rcito no governo, representada por Mour√£o, n√£o se op√µe ao dito ou feito por Bolsonaro. Apenas procura n√£o ser atingida, tamb√©m, pela repercuss√£o negativa do feito bolson√°rico.

  Como a j√° exausta √∫ltima gota, o epis√≥dio que alterou a distribui√ß√£o dos pesos pol√≠ticos foi, na noite de ter√ßa (24), a fala de Bolsonaro em rede de TV. O contrassenso da aliena√ß√£o: uma leitura de mau texto para atacar a estrat√©gia do seu governo no combate ao coronav√≠rus. Mais contrassenso: fala em rede nacional para convocar os brasileiros a n√£o cumprir o isolamento, na resid√™ncia, recomendado pela Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de, em nome da ci√™ncia, para evitar o cont√°gio e diminuir as mortes.

They told me that I didn't meet the criteria for testing but I should ring an ambulance. I was taken by the paramedics to hospital, they did an ECG ion the way, I arrived at the emergency room was given pain management medication and they tried an ultra sound but told me to go home and fast. The next day I came back in and they tortured me with an ultra sound machine, then shot me up with fentanol. Not sure why they didn't do that before the torture of the ultra sound but anyway they found nothing in my gall bladder as they expected. Next the put in in the CT scanner and told me I had appendicitis and would required surgery. When the surgeon saw the CT scan he said you have epiploic appendagitis not appendicitis, you can go home.

legalizing heroin would allow the FDA to regulate it, and put a dent in all the overdoses and drug violence. I‚Äôm a recovered heroin addict, heroin almost ruined my life and it actually killed my best friend 3 days ago who‚Äôs been struggling for the past 5 years. So I‚Äôm hoping this means more coming from someone who knows the hurt addiction can caused- heroin is not the enemy.

67,2020-03-26 19:51:02+00:00,"This got really long. Tldr at the bottom. 

Depends on who you ask. If you ask me, I didnt really cope. If you ask my therapist, she thinks I did an ok job at coping. I lost both my dad and my grandpa in the span of 4 months. Both were very complicated. My dad was abusive and my grandpa had a disease called huntingtons. 

I dealt with my dad's death differently then my grandpa's. Mostly I was angry at my father. Angry that he couldn't treat me better. Angry that he never bothered to try and get to know my husband and instead assumed he was a horrible person. Angry that he couldn't let me be an adult an make my own choices and mistakes. I was also sad, because at one point very early on he wasn't abusive. I actually looked up to him. He used to be a great dad. He taught me how to play video games and how to use a computer. He tried teaching me about cars, but neither of us had a very good attention span. We were both ADHD. He was a big jokester and loved to roughhouse with me. Then he got heavy into drugs. He started neglecting me, locking himself in his room for days leaving me with no food to eat (there was a rule that I couldn't eat anything without asking first. I had tested this rule and got into a huge amount of trouble) and all alone in the house. I can still remember being about 4 or five. I had just learned about phones and had committed my grandmas number to heart. It was the second day without food, and the first time I made a phone call. I called grandma and begged her to come pick me up. I told her I was hungry and lonely. She told me she couldn't come get me because she hadn't talked to dad first and since I couldn't get to him (no amount of pounding or knocking on his door would rouse him)she couldn't take me out of his house without getting into trouble ( unbeknownst to me, he had threatened to run away with me if she ever tried to take me away from him.). That was the day my food issues started. I started stealing food and hiding it in my bedroom for days when he was unreachable.  I only ever took small amounts that weren't missed. A few crackers out of the cheez it box, a single slice of cheese, one piece of bread. I started sneaking food to take home at friends houses, and stashing nonperishables from Grandma's in my over night bags. Grandma eventually catches me stashing food and she intervenes with dad. She gets him to stop locking his door while I'm there and gets him to relax the food rules. A few years go by and he mellows out and turns back into the fun dad. Then tragedy strikes. His best friend died unexpectedly in a car crash. He took up drinking to cope. The drinking is what turned him into a monster. He started getting angry often and getting violent. It started with throwing things and punching and kicking holes in the walls,  and then escalated to physical and emotional abuse. He got so drunk one evening that he mistook me for his girlfriend while I was cuddled up in his bed. That was the last of my trust for him. Things got progressively worse after that. Despite all the shit he put me through, I still miss the dad I had at the beginning. The one who taught me to game. But I'm so angry with how he treated me at the end. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to get past this anger, because there was no closure. If anything, the last time I talked to him (which was about five months before his passing) he was shouting that I needed to be punished and that he was gonna kill me and my dogs. He never said why. To this day I don't know why he hated me and my husband so much. 

My grandpa passed due to complications with pneumonia. He got the pneumonia because he aspirated some food or drink. He aspirated it because the huntingtons messed with his swallowing ability. Before I get any further into it, let me tell you about my grandpa. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force. Had over 2000 flying hours. Piloted during Vietnam (I got a couple stories from him regarding this), was a mathematician professor at CalMaritime. He was so smart he earned the nickname The Wizard. He even won a few chess and sports trophies in his youth. All around smart and fit kinda guy. The huntingtons destroyed all of this. By his last year he was having trouble forming complete thoughts, let alone sentances, and he couldnt walk mote then a few steps with a walker. He had to use a wheelchair most of the time which he hated. He stuck it out for a good long time, but when he became incontinent he just gave up. Stopped trying to do anything. He wouldnt eat or drink, he wouldn't even roll over on his bed. My husband and I had moved in to my grandparents house at this point to be live in care for him and we had to do everything for him(not that I'm complaining, just trying to demonstrate how he went from brilliant to a sack of bones (quite literally. He had no excess body fat by the time he went into the hospital for the last time) in the space of 10 years.). We fed him food that we had blended (think baby food) ourselves, and added thickening agents to his drinks to help him swallow better. We changed his adult diapers(often getting peed on in the process. He was just so out of it) and shifted him in bed every hour or so to prevent bedsores. We tried to engage him in conversation and placed a tv in his room so he could watch documentaries which he had always loved. By the time the pneumonia hit he had stopped talking entirely and spent about 20 hours a day sleeping. He was ready to die. 

Since he could not communicate with us by the time he caught the pneumonia it took us about a day and a half to get worried about his coughing. He had one rare moment of lucidity where he asked to be taken to the hospital and thats when we knew it was bad. He had habitually avoided the doctors unless it was dire. We called an ambulance and had him brought in where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and we were told to gather our family to say goodbye. NY the time we got the diagnosis the lucidity he had was gone. The doctors were continually asking him questions about who he was and if he knew where he was and who we (me, grandma and hubby) were. The last thing he said was that he recognized us. After that he stopped responding to any stimulus except pain. He lasted 13 days in the hospital on morphene in agonizing pain and severely dehydrated. At this point my aunt had flown in to see him. On his third day in the hospital we (grandma and I) were prompted by the nurse to increase his morphine dose. We wanted to, but aunt said no. Because more morphine means he dies quicker. Grandma gave in, partly because she wanted to give our relatives a chance to arrive and say goodbye, and partly becauses she didn't want to upset aunt. At this point I realized grandma was gonna let aunt steamroll her so I took initiative and started spending as much time possible at the hospital to try and get ahead of aunt and let grandpa go in peace. Grandma couldn't do it because she was too old. I was there about 18 hours a day, I'd go home and sleep for four hours and then I was right back at his bedside, playing his favorite music and just talking to him.  I fought for 9 days to get grandma to go against her daughter to up his morphine dose. He was in obvious pain. Anytime the nurses had to move him he moaned. Loudly. He had a bedsore the size of a frying pan on the area just above his behind. Everytime the nurses had to change the bandages more skin was ripped off making the sore even bigger. I finally got tired of trying to convince grandma that her daughter was wrong and tried a different tactic. I secretly made a request for his head doctor to come into his room when grandma and I were there and aunt was not and had the doctor lay everything out. That combined with the knowledge that grandpa was in terrible pain (I had timed it so grandma had just witnessed a nurse come in and change the dressing on the bedsore and heard his cries of pain) finally convinced grandma to up his dose. Aunt got very angry, but grandma was done listening to her. We upped his dose once more on late day 12. His relief was noticeable. He wasn't so ridged in bed, he didn't even groan when the nurses rolled him over. Early day 13, he had one final moment of lucidity that grandma happened to be there for. He opened his eyes for the first time in 12 days and saw her standing next to his bedside. He got the biggest grin on his face grabbed her hand in both of his and just smiled at her. The amount of love on his face was incredible. Then he died. He died smiling and holding her hand. 

The way grandpa passed and the circumstances leading up to it made coping with his death easier. It was his time to go. He was ready. I still miss him. That man single handedly got me through high school math even though we were oceans apart at the time. But it's not an open wound like my dad's death was/is. However, I still despise aunt for making him live in agony far longer then he needed to. I did my best, I was on top of keeping him comfortable and keeping his lips and mouth hydrated. I told the nurses when he needed changing, let them know when he needed another dose of morphine, and everything else. Checked his skin temp every half hour to make sure he was warm enough. I did everything. Aunt was only in the room for about 8 hours a day with frequent hour long breaks. She took control of the situation and was too selfish to admit that his discomfort was more important then her need for him to survive. We had all been told by the doctors at the beginning that he was not going to leave that hospital alive, but she was in denial and thought he'd get better if we just waited long enough. She made him suffer needlessly and I don't think I can forgive her for that. 

Tldr: my abusive father passed and I responded by getting angry, staying angry for a while, and then getting sad. My grandpa passed and I responded with relief.",1

I think people have this warped idea that if you introduce meth or heroin into your body that there's this magic evil chemical that makes you addicted and you're powerless to resist it. It's not how it works. I get what you're saying and you're not wrong, but you say you smoked weed and didn't feel the need to do it again? So? I injected oxycontin and mscontin everyday and then simply stopped and i don't crave more. Does this mean it's safe and not addictive? Chemically addictive or mentally addictive, means nothing.

69,2020-03-26 17:08:54+00:00,"OP... just so you know.. 

i literally actually had to read this 3 times because I kept getting to the end and thinking ""wait, what was the secret dealbreaker that would have made him think you were too fucked up and look at your differently? I don't understand what the issue was/is?

&amp;#x200B;

then I realized what part your were tlaking about... and i don't mean that in a way like ..i don't care.  i'm sorry to hear that... . i hope you're okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I meant that in way as in... why in the world would you think you couldn't tell them that?  there's no way anyone two people could get along that well like you described on so many levels and then think you're fucked up if yo had told him that. that's very sad if you  thinnk thatss true... i promise ou're as valuable as you he made you feel.  that is not at all anything you should be ashamed of like that 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to shove heroin needles in my arm every day for like half a decade. the last person i relectantly because i was nervous she might think she'd have to worry about might still do it and it would be a dealbreaker.. but she told me it was hot and when i mentioned i didnt smoke any more from some off the cuff remark  she got impressed i quit heroina nd cifgaretts and and told me how much she liked all my fuck ups.. and i thought she was poking fun of me at first (hich iw ouldnt have minded at all)  .... ""refused medical treatment at the scene oh my god  that's hot""  ( whnen i realized she ws serious my self esteeem went through the roof and  i was able to start thinking ""holy shit, am i the luckiest person in the orklld to have this erson  legit feeling the same way to me as aam for her? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

im not saying he woudl have necessarily thought you doingthat to yourself is badass in the same way... (i dunno.. maybe if you were over iit and owned it..  he and said it was behind you..he mght.... at the very least ..if it were me.. i'd remember how the only reason i qwanteed and was able to stop trying to kill myself with heroin every day for years was because after like the 4th time the paramedics restarted my heart in the ambulance and jnistead of lecturing me that time ..they were just shaking thir head and one of the emt's was my sisters old boyfriend from highschool  i hadn't seen in 15| years maybe... guys like 50 now with a family. . but on the ride to the hospital he said ""you can't keep doing this .... one day someone one wont be around to call 911 again and we won't get there in time... youre breaking the heart of everyone in your life by doing this... and one of these times you're not gonna wake up and it's gonna kill them all ""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i was suddenlymotiavted and able to quit and did it fairly eeasily all things considered.. because I realized I WANTED TO LIVE&gt;&gt; AND I WAS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE (again) annd i wanted to live because i had family who cared about me but still didnt givee up or shun me ... they just hoped I'd stop eventually and contnued being there. ad my friends that still didnt stop being my friends even the ones who didnt wanna really be around me while i was high.......not because they didnt likeme.. they just knew i was slowly killng myself.. but if youve ever invited someone on heroin over to your house and tried your best to mpretrnd it's all normal ad that youre still friends..and then call other p\[eopel over i had been avoiding and forced me to see they wanted to still be my friend too.... it meant a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

and the junkie friends i was with who kept risking going to jail.. but didn't think twice about calling 911 anyeay because i klept pasing out and dying when they  were with me.... one even said ""i cant kep doing drugs with you...  ione of em said ""you knoe its really not very fun trying to do dope when the person next to you keeps dying every time and the cops keep coming and they haulyou away  in amculance again and i hve to anser all the quetions and hope they dont arrest me for the frugs you were doing..over and over again""

&amp;#x200B;

hell even my sisters boyfriend from nearly 20 years ago when she was in high school who spends all day watching junkies die almosty started crying when he recognized it was me in the gurny... kid who was like 10 he used to drive to the the fireworks and drive in theater when he took my sister on datess... not even because he had to.... theyd ask me if i wanted to come... he was nice...he took the time to be the 50th person that month to try and give me his attempt at convincg me to quit...

&amp;#x200B;

i didnt have anyone in my life on a regular basis like an SO... but there was enough support from all around..people i kept at arms length some i flat out ignored out of gullt or shame for no reason in partiular....  it all wore me down..until i wanted to llive and [stop.so](https://stop.so) i did. i still have other vices... and other people's support makes  me want to always try and be better  for them. i didnt always thnk this way, but i do because so many have stuck around. and when i thought ihad found someone to feel like the way you described.. .i wanted to do anything and everything to make them feel even a smal fraction of the amount of happy and love that they were making me feel. i wanted to start running again randomly because the first thing i thought of to be better  for them was that..they didnt ask..i just ewanted to think of something and its the first thing tat popped nto my head...i would think of more ideas for the rest of muy life.. that seemed like a good start.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

hopefully this story makes you feerl wanted and value yourself the way you should and i promise ... 99% sure that person would have consoled you and then asked ""so what's the thing i cant know about that you think will make me not like you though??? oh wait..that was it?? no...thats not too fuckedf up for me to know about... ot even fucking close"" 

&amp;#x200B;

ive known people who havee harmed themselves... im sure this person would have simply been happy to let him know you trusted him with that information and would have started running randomly the next day and done everything possible to let you know the only thing that hurt was that you thought he would respond that that way  before you drifted away ...and waiting for you to come back still....  i would.  id thin ""wtf kiond of god would bring her into my life then  take her away before i even  had a chance to screw up proper in person not just over the phone"" LOL )joking.. wouldn't blow a second chancelike that... no fucking way"" 

&amp;#x200B;

youre loved op. . by me. him. and whoever else has stuck wiithyou or were there when you needed them that helped you become this person for this many years... i hope you find a permanent partner who wil always be there. supporting eachother makes everyting in life way way way easier and funner. ,, she certainly made me optimistic about life and wanting to just ... do better.. all the time, to make her happier if even for a second or its something small. i wanted to make the world bettter for her..especially if it mgight be the only way i could help her get over that...  thats...

&amp;#x200B;

nm.. you get the idea. i hope you realize youre awesome. theyd probably do whatever it took to help... or at least make you want to do it less often. i wouldnt even be phased by that&gt;&gt; other than to assure you i""d  do whatever i could to help and let you tell me whats bothering you if you ever feel bad&gt;&gt; you deserve to have someone around to talk to about it so yore not writing anonymous letters&gt; yuo  really do&gt; i promise&gt;",1

Be warned: daca faci abuz, gen in loc sa iei 2 pastile, iei 20 pe zi, au efect de drog si acolo normal, ca orice alte droguri gen heroina si cocaina, ai probleme, dependente, rahaturi. Fii baiat destept si nu baga de 10 ori doza pe care ti-o da medicul odata.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.

Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.",1

118,2020-03-22 21:56:44+00:00,"First time posting and I am an actual human and not employed by this law firm but my life was destroyed by being over prescribed opiates at 25 from 2003 to 2006. I had a spinal surgery and developed and an infection which had to be packed for 6 months. This is when oxycotin was really pushed. By the end of the 6 month period I am on oxy 80s, which chemically made me almost psychotic, and then got switched to duladid, another Pharma drug pushed at the time. My doctor wrote for 350 8 mg dualidid a month. I got so bad, not intentionally but because of tolerance and a mental illness it triggered I guess, I would run out. The dr would write for 350 4mg duladid because my insurance would cover it. I didnt know any of this. I was a stay at home new mom with an 8 month old at the time. Lost my husband, split custody of my daughter, lost my daughter, lost many jobs. I wasnt a drug addict before my surgery because I had scoliosis and was braced as a preteen and teen, awesome being a freshman in a brace with bars around your neck and plastic all over your body. Humor became my armor. I had my first scoliosis surgery at 19 and had complications but walked away from the opiates for years. Always a social partier. I drank, smoked pot, randomly coke, nitrice if it was there. Just a normal partier. But not addicted to anything but maybe partying. And went to college and met a guy had a beautiful little girl and then needed another surgery because of the pregnancy on my back. And then I became totally dependent on these massive quantities of narcotics. I was a danger to my daughter. I became a hundred pounds. Had a bleeding ulcer and needed a blood transfusion and then 2 weeks later lost my gallbladder. My pain med prescribing dr was the admitting dr. I was on a duladid drip the whole time in the hospital. Smoked a cigarette in the bathroom out of desperation and was just so fucked out of my mind. The dr then wrote I could walk outside with my iv, unsupervised to go smoke a cig because the nurses were so pissed at me. This is 2005. My life imploded and now at 43 it still has reared its ugly head off and on, on subutex but weaned from 16mg to almost 4mg myself in the past several months, and the consequences are still real and shaming and some permanent. A little stoned and dont feel like rereading this novel I just wrote. So GOD bless u if u got this far.

P.S. I remember why. I joined a class action law suit that some of us may have a right to some compensation from how being over prescribed these opiates in the early 2000s for real things changed the course or our life forever. I will gladly give out the law firm I chose from a random email. But I tell u there is redemption in knowing u didnt cause this. This is something that HAPPENED to YOU! Blessings",2

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

Injuring yourself you did to yourself but again you didn't write the prescriptions for the opiates nor were a lot of people told about the addictive properties of these drugs especially oxycotin. Which was 100% marketed as not addictive, doctors even pushed it that way. So don't tell me the doctors aren't at fault here. When they were getting kick backs from pharma for pushing oxy out the office doors.. In massive amounts..

Maybe look into Florida... 6 months and almost 9 million pills prescribed... Don't try and feed me the line it's your fault for this... People who have never tried to seek out rehab or help. Don't get how hard it is actually to get into a place.. Or the fact that a detox program in Canada sucks balls and relies on AA to do their jobs..

Not to mention the fact a lot of addicts have emense trauma. Such as being raped as children or molested...

Which brings into the failure of our mental health system entirely for those who need it.. The fact you can't get a therapist or councelling...

There's so many things you fail to understand about this massive issue.. You're one person out of hundreds of thousands. Who went to a doctor because they were in pain and long behold the drugs given to you are stupidly addictive.. So not having them becomes the massive difference of being able to look after your children or not being able to without them.. Then you land in a situation where you can't get them legally anymore because of being cut off with 100% negligence and absents of care afterwards..

How about you read ""Dopesick"" and get back to me about these issues and who really is to blame here... Because its definitely not the people who trust their medical staff to do the right thing for them in any circumstance..

I don't stroll into my doctors and expect to get addicted to something they gave me in confidence..

Even Tylenol is addictive... And dangerous AF on your kidneys",1
147,2020-03-20 20:22:16+00:00,"It isn't because these people wouldn't be using this if big pharma didn't lie out the ass about oxycotin and how addictive it actually is..

Considering an oxy 80 on the street is 80 bucks sometimes more and heroin or Fent is a hell of a lot cheaper..

People don't write their prescriptions, doctors do

People also don't produce their own oxycotin, big pharma does and profits massively off people dying and totally gets away with it..

You 100% fail to see the actual picture here..

You want pain management that's not addictive, cbd

Addictions rates wouldn't be so high if we didn't end up with pill farms giving meds out like pixi sticks

Now we've ended up we NEED safe injection sites or supervised use to stop people from dying..

It took me months to get off heroin, months of being horribly sick all because at one time a doctor ended up giving me pills - cutting them off and not acknowledging the pain hasn't gone away...

This is where the major problems lie with opiates. You start with a pill a day and that stops working because your body adapts to them quick.. So you use more and more then you can't afford anymore or get cut off then turn to heroin because it's CHEAP",1

Yea because people 100% write there own prescriptions and 100% expect to end up addicted but also not know it until they have no access to pharma pills..

Guess you underestimated how stupid you actually are......

It's stupid people like you why we have the overdose rate we have...

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

171,2020-03-18 18:42:11+00:00,"Hey I'm with you there, doctors in the ICU see some of the nastiest, most horrific injuries that the rest of us hope to never see.  They dedicate 4 years of undergraduate studies, 4 years of professional school, a residency of some amount of years and often fellowships of some more years.  That's like 12 years AFTER highschool with over 300k loans.  The work hours basically mandate that they care (and imo I wouldn't go into something as stressful as ICU if I was only in it for the money).  

I did make it out to be the doctors fault 100% in my first comment which I shouldn't have.  I did that because I just had a conversation where my mom was telling me about how when my brother was in 2nd grade, his teacher said that he was hyperactive and should get tested for ADD.  Small town, so there was only 1 doctor and he prescribed him Ritalin.  After seeing how it effected him, mom took him off of it only to later find out: out of a class of ~20 something kids, my brother and one other kid were the only ones not prescribed Ritalin by that small town doctor.   

So my brain was on bias mode.  Unless you have a real psycho like Joseph Mengele, your doctor most likely really does want what's best but they're suuuper overloaded constantly so, I get it.  It's not made any easier when all of your patients tend to lie to your face.  

&gt;... sadly, opiates are still our most effective painkillers today. 

When I was doing some research earlier I came across an article from later 2018 saying the FDA approved of a new (at the time) opioid called dsuvia which is 10 times stronger than fetanyl.  Can only imagine what's going to happen when that hits the black market.  

As for your personal experience, I only knew a friend of a friend who was addicted to heroin and it was exactly how you described.  Fucked with pills that they weren't prescribed.  But I think it's probable that the type of people who get hooked from recreational use tend to stand out in the crowd as, well, the stereotypical addict we see fumbling down the street.  Many functioning addicts who hold down a job and are 'responsible' adults will look like everyone else.  I think I read a study a few years back (take with a grain of salt) that said there were just as many coke addicts as there are alcoholics!  

I have no clue how the CDC comes up with their estimates, or if they include people who are prescribed opioids while being addicted for that matter.  It's not like your average fiend is taking surveys.  So I think you bring a good point with the under reporting.

Sorry for the book I wrote, I really wanted to correct myself where I put all of the blame on the doctors shoulders in a majority of cases, I know most doctors would be sympathetic to hear they over prescribed opioids.",1

177,2020-03-18 02:01:27+00:00," Algumas grandes cidades brasileiras, como S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte e Bras√≠lia, tiveram panela√ßos em protesto contra o presidente Jair Bolsonaro na noite desta ter√ßa-feira (17).

 A mobiliza√ß√£o acontece um dia antes de uma manifesta√ß√£o desse tipo convocada em redes sociais para a noite de quarta-feira (18).

 Em S√£o Paulo, os panela√ßos, com gritos de ""fora Bolsonaro"", ocorreram em bairros como Consola√ß√£o, Santa Cec√≠lia, Higien√≥polis e Bela Vista, na regi√£o central, e Pompeia, Pinheiros e Jardins, na zona oeste.

 Em Perdizes, tamb√©m na zona oeste, houve manifesta√ß√µes de apoiadores em resposta, como ""viva Ustra"", refer√™ncia ao coronel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, oficial da ditadura militar [que costuma ser elogiado pelo presidente.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml)

 No Rio de Janeiro, houve manifesta√ß√µes no Jardim Bot√£nico e em Copacabana, na zona sul. Em Bras√≠lia, na Asa Norte.

  Os panela√ßos em janelas de apartamentos se tornaram um dos s√≠mbolos de protesto contra a ent√£o presidente Dilma Rousseff, que sofreu [impeachment em 2016.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2015/brasil-em-crise/)

 Nesta ter√ßa-feira, [foi protocolado ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/primeiro-pedido-de-impeachment-de-bolsonaro-apos-ato-pro-governo-chega-a-camara.shtml)[na C√¢mara](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/primeiro-pedido-de-impeachment-de-bolsonaro-apos-ato-pro-governo-chega-a-camara.shtml) o primeiro pedido de afastamento de Bolsonaro na Presid√™ncia por ter convocado atos contra o Congresso e o Judici√°rio no √∫ltimo fim de semana.

 Na segunda (16), a ex-aliada Janaina Paschoal, deputada estadual em S√£o Paulo pelo PSL, [pediu em discurso que](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/bolsonaro-tem-que-sair-da-presidencia-afirma-janaina-paschoal.shtml) o presidente deixe o cargo.

 Em meio √† crise do coronav√≠rus, o presidente vem tendo um posicionamento de relativizar a dimens√£o da pandemia, embora o pr√≥prio governo j√° tenha solicitado o reconhecimento de calamidade p√∫blica no pa√≠s.

 Governadores nos estados, [como Wilson Witzel (PSC), no Rio, ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/03/rj-lidera-restricoes-para-combater-contaminacao.shtml)anunciaram medidas dr√°sticas para reduzir a circula√ß√£o de pessoas, como impedir o tr√°fego de √¥nibus intermunicipais.

 Antes do agravamento da pandemia, a UNE (Uni√£o Nacional dos Estudantes), centrais sindicais e grupos de esquerda haviam marcado um protesto contra o governo para o dia 18, mas a mobiliza√ß√£o foi suspensa por causa do risco de dissemina√ß√£o da doen√ßa.

 Na manh√£ desta ter√ßa, Bolsonaro voltou a afirmar que [existe uma ""histeria""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/bolsonaro-desafia-maia-e-alcolumbre-e-ve-histeria-no-combate-ao-coronavirus.shtml) em rela√ß√£o √† crise do [coronav√≠rus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/coronavirus/) e disse que far√° uma ""festinha tradicional"" para celebrar seus 65 anos.

 O presidente faz anivers√°rio neste s√°bado (21). Especialistas em sa√∫de recomendam evitar aglomera√ß√µes e reduzir o contato social para fazer frente √† crise sanit√°ria.

 ""Eu fa√ßo 65 [anos] daqui a quatro dias"", disse, em entrevista √† r√°dio Super Tupi. O apresentador do programa em seguida lhe pergunta: ""vai ter bolo presidente?"" ""Vai ter uma festinha tradicional aqui. At√© porque eu fa√ßo anivers√°rio dia 21 e minha esposa dia 22. S√£o dois dias de festa aqui"", acrescentou. ""Emenda, dia 21, pr√≥ximo de meia-noite ela me cumprimenta; logo depois eu a cumprimento"".

 Al√©m de falar que realizar√° o evento para o seu anivers√°rio, Bolsonaro afirmou que medidas adotadas por [governadores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/03/sem-dinheiro-estados-nao-tem-planos-para-aliviar-crise-com-coronavirus.shtml) para conter a Covid-19 v√£o prejudicar muito a economia.

 ""Esse v√≠rus trouxe uma certa histeria. Tem alguns governadores, no meu entender, posso at√© estar errado, que est√£o tomando medidas que v√£o prejudicar e muito a nossa economia"", declarou.

 ""A vida continua, n√£o tem que ter histeria. N√£o √© porque tem uma aglomera√ß√£o de pessoas aqui e acol√° esporadicamente [que] tem que ser atacado exatamente isso. [√â] tirar a histeria. Agora, o que acontece? Prejudica"", acrescentou.

 Ao menos 15 pessoas que se encontraram com Bolsonaro em viagem recente aos EUA est√£o com coronav√≠rus. O presidente disse na noite desta ter√ßa que um novo teste apontou que ele n√£o contraiu a doen√ßa.",1

185,2020-03-17 05:17:56+00:00,"Yeah IV morphine is absolutley delightful. In Norway we get MScontin as our ER morphine, dolcontin is the brand name. I do believe is says something similar to morphinesulfat, simply a longer version (so I searched it up); Morfinsulfatpentahydrat. This may be another spelling than what it is for you, since I copied it from my country's medical(/medicine or medicinal? I really have no clue)-catalogue. Sadly I haven't gotten around to even trying diladud (at least I thought it was spelled like that, but you may be right here), but if I did get my hands on any I would start with shooting if I didn't have plenty, otherwise I'd dip my toe first, but if I'm not mistaking, diladud is hydromorphone yeah? And like moprhine, has poor oral and nasal BA. Not a 100% on this one, but close to.

Yeah, I won't do that again, that's for sure. I really do prefer the oral way, snorting doesn't work Jack shit either. And smoking, well I'd be flabbergasted if that actually would work. I wouldn't be suprised if I did however prefer shooting it up if the dose was big enough, as I am crazy addicted to the rush (as any IV user would). Sadly I can't stop myself from doing IV drugs as I simply does not find the other ROA's appealing anymore. Other than the drugs I haven't done IV yet, and I'll try to keep it that way. However I'm not that into shooting up benzo, but I will toss some in the mix if I don't have enough dope for a nice shot. With xannys and rohypnol being the exception.

196,2020-03-16 11:13:22+00:00,"Funcion√°ria v√™ Bolsonaro em entrevista na TV Record.NACHO DOCE (REUTERS)Na reta final da campanha do Brasil, est√° em curso em v√°rios setores das elites brasileiras [uma marcha impar√°vel de normaliza√ß√£o dos graves riscos de um Governo Jair Bolsonaro](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/10/02/politica/1538432558_436000.html). Primeiro, operadores do mercado financeiro, apoios formais das bancadas conservadoras no Congresso, endosso do candidato que foi presidente da poderosa Fiesp. Sem falar do endosso t√°cito do sil√™ncio. √â um processo a jato. Ningu√©m s√©rio acha que aquele plano de Bolsonaro cheio de exclama√ß√µes e del√≠rios seja cr√≠vel, ou que ele tenha equipe, ou que n√£o v√° haver turbul√™ncias. Mas, seja como for, √© melhor j√° ir se acomodando. Talvez da√≠ a pressa de Xico Graziano, ex-chefe de gabinete do Governo FHC, em declarar apoio ao capit√£o reformado do Ex√©rcito, mesmo n√£o concordando ""com v√°rias das ideias dele."" Vai que sobra um lugar no pal√°cio para os servi√ßos desse tucano de t√£o boa plumagem?

Graziano √© a vers√£o √†s claras sobre esse cinismo de largos setores das elites pol√≠ticas e econ√¥micas que pretendem aderir ao bolsonarismo sem nem sequer tapar o nariz. [√â o que leva Paulo Guedes a balbuciar frases conservadoras](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/08/23/politica/1534995588_943964.html) sobre educa√ß√£o sexual nas escolas s√≥ para tentar parecer mais integrado e menos oportunista, por exemplo. Ocorre, no entanto, que ""v√°rias das ideias"" de Bolsonaro representam riscos concretos a vidas. Representam muitos passos a mais no aprofundamento da nossa barb√°rie. As elites devem saber disso, mas ter as m√£os sujas de sangue parece ser um dano colateral j√° precificado. N√£o ser√° as vidas deles, desde logo. E pensar que aceitar a m√£o decisiva e corrompida do (bolsonarista) Eduardo Cunha para tirar o PT do poder ‚Äì com o apoio do ex-presidente [Fernando Henrique Cardoso](https://brasil.elpais.com/autor/fernando_henrique_cardoso) ‚Äì [parecia um cap√≠tulo vergonhoso da hist√≥ria recente.](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/04/15/opinion/1460743784_396496.html)

N√£o se trata de dizer que o bolsonarismo √© um fen√¥meno apenas de elites, ainda que ele j√° estivesse eleito se fossem contados apenas os mais ricos, j√° que para entrar nos ""mais ricos"" n√£o √© preciso muito no nosso pa√≠s pobre. A declara√ß√£o de voto em Bolsonaro se espraia em todas as faixas de renda. Mas o ponto aqui √© quem mais vai ganhar e quem mais vai perder com esse arranjo. Quem, no 1% mais rico, mal pode esperar por um experimento com tintas pinochetistas. Vamos pular a parte em que os analistas fingem acreditar que se trata de ""dois extremos"" em disputa ou que as nossas institui√ß√µes, mergulhadas at√© o pesco√ßo no salve-se quem puder da nossa crise pol√≠tica cr√¥nica, ser√£o um muro de conten√ß√£o. Com um pouco de racioc√≠nio, chega-se √† obviedade de que o projeto representado pelo populista de extrema direita Jair Bolsonaro n√£o precisa de lei alguma para fazer dano.

O discurso violento do capit√£o reformado do Ex√©rcito √© um endosso cruel aos piores problemas que j√° temos: machismo, intoler√¢ncia √† comunidade [LGBTQ+](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/lgtb), e, algo transversal a tudo isso e potencialmente explosivo, a viol√™ncia policial. N√£o custa repetir que o flerte mais pr√≥ximo do projeto Bolsonaro n√£o √© com Donald Trump, √© com [Rodrigo Duterte](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/rodrigo_roa_duterte), [o presidente ""bandido bom √© bandido morto"" das Filipinas](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2017/07/03/eps/1499089617_332439.html) e as milhares v√≠timas que j√° deixou. Veja bem, n√£o estamos falando apenas do tristes enfrentamentos entre *antifas* e racistas em [Charlottesville](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/disturbios_charlottesville_2017/a/). Nem apenas da indignidade de separar crian√ßas imigrantes de seus pais nos EUA. A nossa escala, num pa√≠s com 63.000 mortos ao anos, pode ser catastr√≥fica. O outro aqui n√£o √© necessariamente o imigrante. O outro, que n√£o merece o mesmo status humano, √© s√≥ a empregada ou o porteiro da classe m√©dia alta de S√£o Paulo depois que ela cruza a marginal rumo √†s franjas da cidade.

O policial m√©dio brasileiro √© jogado em campo sem intelig√™ncia ou estrat√©gia, para matar e morrer com outros de sua faixa de renda. Esse policial faz parte da trag√©dia, n√≥s sabemos, como tamb√©m sabemos dos s√°dicos que praticam tortura e gravam e distribuem no WhatsApp. A tortura, heran√ßa da [escravid√£o](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/esclavitud) e da [ditadura](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/dictadura_brasilena), jamais desapareceu das nossas delegacias e pris√µes. Agora, aquilo que era tolerado, quase nunca investigado ou punido, para o que se fazia vista grossa, ganha um respaldo, vertical, se irradia. √â o torturador que ser√° fortalecido, acalmado em qualquer mal-estar que lhe reste, porque o heroi do candidato a presidente √© tamb√©m um torturador.

Mesmo que o candidato de extrema direita n√£o ven√ßa, apesar desse esfor√ßo veloz de lev√°-lo de outsider a campe√£o do establishment sem escalas em uma semana, o dano j√° estar√° feito. Cabe √† nossa sociedade saber como lidar politicamente, sem alienar de pronto, [com uma parte expressiva do pa√≠s que v√™ uma esperan√ßa leg√≠tima em Jair Bolsonaro.](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/08/17/politica/1534457864_835707.html)",1

I had no support system, no family. So suicide seemed the best option. 

The stash contained: 4 vicodins, 2 oxycotins 3 norcos. I looked in my medicine cabinet and just had antidepressants and a bottle of benadryl. I chose the benadryl, took the whole thing and my stash. I lost 3 days tripping, and more recovering. I'm a small girl, so I got lucky. But I later found out that benadryl will not kill you, you'll just trip, and I probably still had some tolerance to opiates, bc it was only the 3rd day, I'm sure that's why I ended up okay. According to my ex, he ""took care of me"" and monitored my very slow and irregular heartrate (wtf?) I mean, at the time I wanted to die but that's just objectively shitty. I remember bits and pieces but what I remember are horrifying hallucinations. The strongest memory is getting up out of bed and trying to call for help but benadryl gives you terrible cotton mouth and you literally cannot talk. I remember trying to ask my bf for help and started to run/stumble out the front door to get away from demons chasing me. I got as far as the sidewalk but he picked me up and brought me back inside and I thought he was delivering me to the monsters. But I don't remember what happened when I got inside. It's hard to describe the hallucinations except it isn't like acid or shrooms. It's a delerium, similar to devil's weed (which I've never done, but erowid accounts look similar to what I experienced on benedryl). It's like the things you see are literally there, just like when you're sober, you can't tell the difference. And your environment changes. At one point I was talking to my mother in my childhood bedroom asking about why she abused me. She started to laugh and turn into one of same demons I kept seeing the entire trip. I spoke to other friends too but can't remember about what. At one point I just woke up, and I was sober. I can't even describe the way I felt. I hadn't eaten or drank water for the last 3 days. That's the first thing I did, crawl to the sink and drink. It took a while for my bf to convince me that myfriends did not come over, I didn't visit my mom, but the monsters were easier for me to understand were hallucinations, obviously. 

I left him 4 years ago, been sober for 5 year and no longer suicidal. In fact, my life is great! But damn, darkest time of my life. I can't imagine anyone tripping on benedryl purposefully. It was kinda traumatic tbh. 

TL/DR: tried to commit suicide with benadryl but accidentally tripped balls that I was in hell.",1

its quite easy if you have the right lab equipment. i read a different article the other day posted by a german chemist with steps also.

basically you have to synthesize the precursor (4-piperidone hydrochloride) using acetonitrile, potassium carbonate, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (and some others). once u get the 4phc then theres a few more steps and youll have a batch of extremely potent fetanyl. a similar process is used for carfentanil. 

all things in consideration, its relatively easy to produce fentanyl compared to oxycodone/hydrocodone which take longer and more raw chemicals. im pretty sure the precursor to the ‚Äúcodones‚Äù and ‚Äúamadols‚Äù have basis in meperidine. (correct me if im wrong XD )",1

#*Pressed pill inquiries are not permitted under any circumstances.*

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

No for fucking real
Anything that binds to NMDA receptors causes urinary problems... Thats a fucking fact. I didnt even abuse it..  I used it like 20 times over a 3 month period... 

This fucking kid is trying to say acetaminophen causes problems like that when i always bought robbitussin gel caps.. 

Im not stigmatizing anything... Its a fucking bad drug that causes bodily harm

If you really think everything is fucking safe as fuck.. Especially for a fucking 15 year old kid... Than what the fuck are you on.

You cant follow harm reduction if you are a 15 year old kid... He already is using worse fucking drugs like oxycotin and mdma (which is very neurotoxic) and he claims to have LOTS of experiance with them.. What kind of fucking 15 year old kid should have LOTS of experiance with MDMA.. None... 


He shouldn't be doing these kinds of drugs at this age... And thats fucking true.

He is trying to idiodicly tell me its from fucking acetaminaphe... A quick google search will tell you dxm causes urinary problems... 

Better yet the psychonautwiki states it on their fucking page about dxm

This is straight up from the wiki:

Urinary tract effects

DXM s likely to exhibit similar bladder and urinary tract problems to those found within¬†ketamine¬†when used repeatedly and excessively for extended periods of time, but to a lesser extent.  Symptoms of ketamine-induced cystitis can become extremely serious and can be described as:

Urinary frequency¬†- Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.

Urinary urgency¬†- This can be described as a sudden, compelling need to urinate.

Urinary pressure¬†- This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.

Pelvic and bladder pain¬†- Pain can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine.

Hematuria¬†- Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.

Incontinence¬†- This is the leakage of urine.


I dont understand why you are saying my comment is dumb. There are risks and the fucking 15 year old kid obviously doesn't know that... 

This is a dumb drug.. Dont do it.",2

 O material usado como prova pela Promotoria foi recolhido em janeiro de 2019, quando [foi deflagrada a Opera√ß√£o Os Intoc√°veis](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/01/operacao-contra-milicia-prende-33-no-rio-sendo-oito-policiais.shtml). Os documentos foram encontrados no escrit√≥rio do homem apontado como respons√°vel pelas finan√ßas da quadrilha de Rio das Pedras, na zona oeste do Rio.

 S√£o faturas de cart√£o de cr√©dito, boletos de contas de energia e recibos em nome de Adriano ‚Äîtamb√©m identificado como ‚ÄúGordinho‚Äù nos documentos‚Äî e com refer√™ncias √† mulher do ex-PM, Julia Lotuffo.

 Adriano esteve foragido por mais de um ano at√© o m√™s passado, [quando foi morto durante uma opera√ß√£o policial na Bahia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/entenda-a-morte-de-miliciano-e-os-elos-dele-com-flavio-bolsonaro.shtml). A fam√≠lia do ex-PM diz que ele foi v√≠tima de uma ""queima de arquivo"", e os resultados de uma segunda per√≠cia no corpo do miliciano ainda n√£o foram divulgados.

 O ex-capit√£o [foi homenageado por Fl√°vio Bolsonaro na Assembleia Legislativa do Rio de Janeiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/01/ex-pm-estava-preso-por-homicidio-quando-flavio-bolsonaro-o-homenageou.shtml) e tamb√©m defendido pelo presidente Jair Bolsonaro em 2005, quando ele ainda era deputado federal.

  Adriano tinha at√© 2018 [duas parentes no quadro de funcion√°rios do antigo gabinete de Fl√°vio na Assembleia do Rio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/01/flavio-bolsonaro-empregou-mae-e-mulher-de-capitao-preso-em-operacao-contra-milicias.shtml). Ele controlava contas usadas para abastecer Fabr√≠cio Queiroz, amigo do presidente Bolsonaro e ex-assessor de Fl√°vio [suspeito de ser o operador da ‚Äúrachadinha‚Äù investigada pelo Minist√©rio P√∫blico do Rio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/01/entenda-as-suspeitas-sobre-flavio-bolsonaro-e-o-ex-assessor-fabricio-queiroz.shtml). Nesse tipo de esquema, funcion√°rios s√£o coagidos a devolver parte de seus sal√°rios aos deputados.

 As defesas de Adriano [e de Fl√°vio afirmam n√£o haver provas de que o ex-PM integrava a mil√≠cia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/advogado-diz-que-miliciano-ligado-a-flavio-bolsonaro-tinha-certeza-de-que-seria-morto.shtml) de Rio das Pedras, motivo pelo qual era procurado havia mais de um ano. Os autos da a√ß√£o penal a que respondia, por√©m, mostram algumas das evid√™ncias recolhidas pelos investigadores.

 As principais foram encontradas no escrit√≥rio de Manoel de Brito Batista, o Cabelo, apontado como o administrador da mil√≠cia. Era ele quem controlava pagamentos e cuidava do dia a dia dos neg√≥cios explorados pela quadrilha.

 No local, policiais encontraram uma conta de luz referente a um im√≥vel que Adriano declarou ser sua resid√™ncia ao depor como testemunha, em 2018, no inqu√©rito sobre a [morte de Marielle Franco (PSOL) e de seu motorista, Anderson Gomes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/acusados-pela-morte-de-marielle-vao-a-juri-popular-decide-juiz.shtml) ‚Äîn√£o h√° nenhuma evid√™ncia sobre a atua√ß√£o de Adriano na morte da vereadora.

 A conta de luz estava em nome de outra pessoa, mas tinha a inscri√ß√£o feita √† m√£o indicando ""Gordinho"", apelido que o Minist√©rio P√∫blico afirma ser usado pelos membros da mil√≠cia para se referir a Adriano.

 O apelido tamb√©m aparece escrito √† m√£o em boletos de cart√£o de cr√©dito em nome de outras pessoas encontrados no escrit√≥rio de Manoel. Ele aparece ao lado da inscri√ß√£o ""Julia"". Investigadores afirmam se tratar de Julia Lotuffo, mulher do ex-PM h√° cinco anos.

 A **Folha **apurou que algumas empresas que aparecem na fatura do cart√£o de cr√©dito foram notificadas para esclarecer quem foi o real cliente do servi√ßo. As respostas indicam o pr√≥prio Adriano, Julia e a m√£e do ex-PM, Raimunda Veras Magalh√£es, ex-assessora de Fl√°vio Bolsonaro, refor√ßando serem contas pessoais do ex-capit√£o em nome de laranjas.

 O nome ‚ÄúGordinho‚Äù tamb√©m aparece num vasto registro de contabilidade apontando rendimento com o aluguel de im√≥veis em favelas dominadas pela mil√≠cia.

 Um outro documento encontrado no escrit√≥rio de Cabelo √© ainda mais expl√≠cito ao apontar o v√≠nculo entre o ex-capit√£o e a mil√≠cia. Trata-se de um recibo feito √† m√£o por um vendedor de um terreno em Santa Cruz, outro bairro da zona oeste. Neste papel, datado de 2012, o nome do comprador aparece completo: ‚ÄúAdriano Magalh√£es da N√≥brega‚Äù.

 Este recibo, para os respons√°veis pela investiga√ß√£o, indica que o administrador da mil√≠cia cuidava de outros neg√≥cios de Adriano, e n√£o apenas os relacionados com Rio das Pedras. H√° ainda a suspeita de que o ex-capit√£o tivesse tamb√©m se associado √† mil√≠cia de Santa Cruz, que tem outros integrantes.

 Essas s√£o as primeiras evid√™ncias documentais contra Adriano j√° obtidas pela pol√≠cia.

 Quando a acusa√ß√£o foi apresentada ao juiz Guilherme Kalil, da 4¬™ Vara Criminal, as provas contra Adriano se resumiam a tr√™s cita√ß√µes a seu primeiro nome em conversas interceptadas com autoriza√ß√£o judicial e tr√™s den√∫ncias an√¥nimas apresentadas ao Disque-Den√∫ncia.

 O MP-RJ na ocasi√£o j√° atribu√≠a o apelido ‚ÄúGordinho‚Äù a Adriano. E usava duas intercepta√ß√µes em que Cabelo se referia ao apelido para refor√ßar o envolvimento do ex-PM.

 A den√∫ncia e seus anexos, contudo, n√£o apontavam como os promotores conclu√≠ram que era essa a forma usada para se referir ao ex-capit√£o. Al√©m disso, a pr√≥pria Promotoria afirmava existir um outro ‚ÄúGordinho‚Äù, que atuava como corretor de im√≥veis.

 Com essas provas iniciais, o juiz Kalil deferiu a abertura de a√ß√£o penal contra Adriano e expediu mandado de pris√£o contra ele. Durante as buscas e apreens√µes, foram encontrados os documentos que refor√ßaram as informa√ß√µes da Promotoria.

 Para investigadores, as provas recolhidas mostram o ex-PM como um dos chefes da mil√≠cia e demonstram a exist√™ncia de dois ‚ÄúGordinhos‚Äù em Rio das Pedras: o corretor que comercializa os im√≥veis irregulares e Adriano, que lucra com o neg√≥cio ilegal.

 Obter provas contra o ex-PM ligado √† fam√≠lia Bolsonaro foi um desafio de investigadores por mais de uma d√©cada.

 A investiga√ß√£o sobre a mil√≠cia de Rio das Pedras foi aberta em 2018 como um bra√ßo da apura√ß√£o sobre um grupo de assassinos de aluguel, chamado pelo MP-RJ de ‚ÄúEscrit√≥rio do Crime‚Äù. Nessa apura√ß√£o, a pol√≠cia chegou a quebrar o sigilo telef√¥nico de oito celulares e dois telefones fixos atribu√≠dos a Adriano. Nenhum deles registrou conversas.

 ‚ÄúO fato de o denunciado Adriano n√£o falar ao telefone, bem como delegar aos seus asseclas o gerenciamento dos neg√≥cios il√≠citos provenientes das atividades criminosas desempenhadas pela organiza√ß√£o criminosa, evitando qualquer tipo de exposi√ß√£o, refor√ßa, ainda mais, a sua hierarquia sobre os demais integrantes da malta‚Äù, escreveu a Promotoria na den√∫ncia contra o ex-PM.

 Investigadores afirmam que o ex-capit√£o trocava de telefone constantemente para evitar ser grampeado. Na opera√ß√£o em que foi morto, ele tinha em sua posse 13 celulares, que est√£o sendo analisados pelo MP-RJ.

 O ex-capit√£o tamb√©m j√° havia respondido a uma a√ß√£o penal por tentativa de homic√≠dio contra o pecuarista Rog√©rio Mesquita em meio a uma disputa entre bicheiros da capital. Embora preso duas vezes pelo crime, com base em diversos depoimentos que apontavam seu envolvimento, foi absolvido na Justi√ßa porque as testemunhas n√£o confirmaram √† Justi√ßa as vers√µes que deram √† pol√≠cia.

 ‚ÄúAs raz√µes pelas quais a instru√ß√£o se deu de forma t√£o acidentada podem ser especuladas, mas at√© o momento, n√£o puderam ser provadas‚Äù, escreveu o juiz M√°rcio Gava em sua senten√ßa que livrou Adriano e outros cinco r√©us.

 ### Documentos n√£o provam pagamentos, diz defesa

 O[ advogado Paulo Em√≠lio Catta Preta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/advogado-diz-que-miliciano-ligado-a-flavio-bolsonaro-tinha-certeza-de-que-seria-morto.shtml), que defende a fam√≠lia de Adriano, afirmou que os documentos apreendidos n√£o comprovam a atua√ß√£o do ex-PM junto √† mil√≠cia de Rio das Pedras.

 ‚ÄúNo m√°ximo provam que ele conhecia aquelas pessoas. Ele podia conhecer essas pessoas, isso n√£o quer dizer que tinha uma participa√ß√£o na suposta organiza√ß√£o criminosa‚Äù, disse Catta Preta.

 Ele tamb√©m negou que o ex-PM e sua mulher tivessem contas pessoais pagas em cart√µes de outras pessoas, como indicam os documentos.

 ‚ÄúEm momento algum eles tiveram contas pagas por terceiros. Os elementos s√£o muito fr√°geis. Ela [J√∫lio Lotuffo] n√£o reconhece que esses cart√µes em nome de terceiros a beneficiaram. Ela diz tamb√©m que o Adriano n√£o usava cart√µes de outros‚Äù, declarou o advogado.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Maybe its the surfer look idk. But ya I've got some permanent damage, looking to increase my script as fast as possible lol. It sucks though bc I can't do anything physical, like the outdoors or most hobbies. Thank god for opioids, if it wasn't for the blessing of morphone, I'm not sure I'd be here today.

I get prescribed gabapentin, perc 10's and ibuprofen. Speaking of gabapentin, it's a GREAT potentiator. Honestly a huge difference, night and day really. it feels like a mild benzo is how i'd describe it. Defintely recommend it. Tbh, I wouldn't be doing oxy as much if it weren't for the gaba. Also,I recently went searching for a new pain doc and found one. Told him I was looking for an increase, and that my last doc wouldn't. My pain doc is such a g, he straight up told me ""I'll take care of you"" when I first met him a few months ago. I've tried 3 other pain docs before, who all suck and suck the CDC's dicks. My current doc was like, 'CVS tried to get me to lower your script, and I told them no.' HA!

I was on Norco 10's for 8 months before I switched to this new doc. The last one said he wouldn't increase bc he was only practicing at an orthopedic office, not an actual pain clinic, which sounds like bull to me.

I take the percoets morning and night everyday, and try to skip the daytime ones if I can manage.  But I have built some tolerance over the years.  However I am afraid to talk to my doctor about any changes to them as it's such a sensitive subject!  Prescribing opioids for long term use, even if its valid, is such a taboo now it's sad.  As is I have to take extra annual drug test and sign paperwork.  My doctor is considered easy going already and I've had to reassure him twice that I'm accountable/responsible on it.

I was addicted to weed for 2 years, was already thinking about taking a time out of it cause was fucking my memory. By this time I occasionally used mdma and lsd mainly in festivals, so I never abused these drugs. Then I discovered cocaine. Always loved stimulants, mdma, ritalin, etc. But coke got me pretty hard, I even stopped smoking weed at home everyday, only with friends, developed a habit of using coke once a week but even though I smoked weed LITERALLY everyday for 2 years and it was fucking me up, not smoking and using coke once a week is fucking me more. I have the bad or good luck (you decide) of beeing a high middle class living in South America, where coke is cheap and generally not that cut with shit, so, its pretty good. Althought I always loved weed I find strange how stims get to me. Even mdma, but the thing down here is expensive as fuck so we don't really have the habit of using that much as the fame europeans get. But if I would give advice to anyone I would say to be very careful with stims, for me they are the most addictive shit there is. I only started using Benzos for the coke comedowns. Can't say nothing about opioids, they are really rare down here, although my friends mother is a nurse and once we found a bottle of dimorphine full and a trillion of boxes of pills empty, we didn't have the courage to inject the shit but I really wanned to find some pills, I'm very curious about opioids.",2

Here's some further really interesting tidbits about acetylated oxymorphone. It's insane how one of them is speculated to be 800% more potent than oxymorphone itself! That's the one that's really gotta be the holy grail of pharmaceutical opioids IMO. Because oxymorphone iteslf is said to be obscenely euphoric, and then when u acetylate it on top of that, it probably takes it to another level of greatness. Ahh, I can only wish to one day get to try it. But just think, if u could convert oxycodone to oxymorphone, and then acetylate that into the most potent version, it seems like just a couple mg IV would be quite potent.

***3,14-Diacetyloxymorphone is an opioid analgesic which has never been marketed. It is an acetyl derivative of oxymorphone. It is related to other acetylated morphone derivatives, including 3,6-diacetyloxymorphone, 3,8,14-triacetyloxymorphone, 3,6,8,14-tetraacetyloxymorphone, noroxymorphone analogs of all or most of the above, and 3,6,14-triacetyloxymorphone, a derivative of oxymorphone whose structure-activity relationship suggests is 800% the potency of the parent drug versus 250% for 3,14-diacetyoxymorphone. Both were developed in Austria in the 1920s along with other derivatives of the strong dihydromorphinones and these drugs are generated by reacting oxymorphone with either acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride at various temperatures in the 80-160 ¬∞C for several hours; 3,6,14-triacetyloxymorphone may be more easily made when a catalylst is used but elevated pressure or reaction in vacuo or under a nitrogen or noble gas atmosphere is not required. Each of the acetyl esters of oxymorphone has a hydromorphone analogue, and these were all developed around the same time (1915-1930) in Austria and Germany.***",1
309,2020-03-09 23:02:58+00:00,"My story is the opposite. In the year 2016, out of nowhere I started having a major pain attack in the middle under part of my ribs. It was like somebody was cutting my organs out with a knife. I had kidney stones before, but this was way more painful than that. I went to the ER and the doctors ran many tests, but they couldn't find anything. I started to get these attacks about every few months and after an echo they found gallstones in my galbladder,  so they suspected I had colic attacks and the logic step was to remove my gallbladder. I had my galbladder surgically removed in 2016. But after a month the attacks continued. After many tests and spending many days at the gastro-enterologist department in the hospital they started to get frustrated. Everytime when I got back to the ER I got a few morphine shots until the pain went away and was sometimes discharged from the hospital the same day without any medical research (only standard blood tests, like liver values etc..). And one day in 2019, I got an attack for over 10 hours. This was my longest attack, I really wanted to die because the pain was unbearable. After that the pain went from a few times per month to daily. At the end, the doctors thought I was just overreacting or lying and they cut me off the morphine. My pain score was a 10 (My kidney stones was a 8, and it was stuck for 4 days), I was only administered 2.5ml Morphine subcutaneous 3 times over a time period of 4 hours per dosage and they refused to give me any more because they were telling me that ""this was the maximum dosage or I could die."" (At home I already was used to 6x 10mg Oxycodon and that is way more than the hospital gave me) I screamed my lungs out, I started to panic and the pain was a traumatic experience even to this day. I called my girlfriend and she was allowed to stay the entire night. The next day the doctors told me they couldn't do anything else to help me, they said I had to live with the pain and they didn't want to higher my Oxycodone dosage from home so I couldn't get any rest from the pain. The next day I went to my general practitioner and I got an attack right in front of her. Luckily she took the pain very serious and I got an morphine shot of 5ml to begin with. My medication was altered to Fentanyl patches (37.5mcg per 2 days) and 3x 10mg oxycodone per day. I was finally able to cope with the pain without rushing to the ER. The next day my girlfriend googled for the terms ""Skin pain"" and we came across a site that was written by a doctor from a different hospital a few towns away. The page describes something called ACNES, all the symptoms were exactly the same and I immediately asked for a appointment. And after 2 months the diagnosis was made. I have ACNES. After 3 years fighting the doctors to get them to believe me, a weight was lifted of my shoulders. The pain was finally being treated that was supposedly ""in my head"". Now I'm getting shots every 2 weeks directly at the region where it hurts and I'm slowly getting better. if this treatment is finished I don't have to take morphine anymore and the shots work permanently. I am happy that I didn't listened to that hospital's advice and kept on searching for an answer to treat my pain. Unfortunately I've lost my job because I've been sick for over 2 years, my relationship took a real toll and I am furious that the hospital that i put my trust in didn't took me serious at all and didn't even took the time to give me the proper medication to control my pain. And they took out my gallbladder that not only didn't cured me, but since the nerve was punctured during the surgery it made the ACNES even worse. I experienced with my own eyes how doctors think they know everything better and the patient is dumb, and only follow protocol without thinking about the patient's wellbeing. They made many mistakes when I was hospitalized and I saw many doctors in that hospital who didn't look further and it took my girlfriend 1 Google search to get the final diagnose. That's why I'm pissed at medical professionals who think they know it all and think your overreacting when they don't know where the pain is coming from and therefore were not valuable of their time. I'm thinking of filing an official complaint as soon I'm off the painkillers and completely cured. Thankfully I found the real answer to my unbearable pain. Hopefully I get to live a normal life soon! Don't know if I'm the only one or that there are more people who experienced this kind of behavior from doctors.",1

do u think there's still better opioids out there to be discovered by tinkering with the naturally occurring opiates, or u think the chemists 100+ yrs ago discovered all the good stuff? I'm sure there's other full synthetics out there, but I'm not sure about the semi-synthetics. I mean there's probably gotta still be some hidden gems out there, right? 

it seems they really did find something special in oxycodone though, because that's the only opioid I've felt that really has an exhilarating energy to it. plus just look at the massive success of Oxycontin. MScontin was around for around for at least a decade beforehand, and I don't think it was nearly as popular. So seeing as oxymorphone is actually 1 of the metabolites of oxycodone breakdown in vivo -- that's why I think it must also be great in its own right. And then we all know how great acetylation can be for opioids lol. That actually makes me wonder if there's an acetylated version of oxycodone? Surely there must be, but maybe it would have issues like the potential ones u pointed out with oxymorphone, since there's a few different spots where u can acetylate the molecules..",1

320,2020-03-09 06:21:37+00:00,"Looked it up, seems similar but not quite the same.

Basically, there are some pharmaceutical products that would never be prescribed to a woman and shouldn't even be handled by a woman, because they affect growth and reproductive hormones. The one I'm familiar with is an acne treatment called Accutane which can be prescribed to women, but comes with a ton of warnings about being sexually active during and after treatment. But for people who make it, well they're around the drug all the time, so the risk is considerable. 

So where they manufacture these drugs and perform QA testing, women can't be around it at all, even with normal precautions the risk is too great. I imagine there's good reason why they can't ask their employees to never even risk conceiving a baby by being sexually active, even one case would be a horrible tragedy, so they're prohibited from even being around it. This isn't so unusual really, all these products are produced in a very safe manner and these precautions are just part of that, the risk is actually very remote but given the scale of production even a remote risk is guaranteed to eventually happen. 

Of course everything is made in a cleanroom, but for most products exposure isn't a big deal.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts.

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution.

#Fentany Reagent Testing

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues.

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.

Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,

Most the time they're gonna test for eight or ten different categories of drugs (alcohol, weed, codones, morphine derivatives including h, amphetamines, benzos, barbiturates, fetanyl, and mtd).

Opiates require multiple administrations over consecutive or near-consecutive days to form a physical addiction. Stronger synthetic opiates, like fentayl &amp; buprenorphine, which take longer to clear the body also require multiple intakes over consecutive days.  
  
Vomiting is a common side-effect of opiates, commencing anywhere from prior to taking the drug, immediately after consumption or anywhere thereafter.  
The human body is amazingly pro-active. The vomiting mechanism is the body trying to get rid of the toxin you've just ingested. Many addicts - &amp; alcoholics with alcohol - will find their bodies rejecting the toxin in advance.

I live in the North East and started 20 years ago shooting China White. I was clean for a long time and when I got back into it the market here is flooded with fentenyl which I don't think feels like real H at all.   A lot of stuff even real H is cut with fent and it's so potent that it hardens your tolerance pretty quick and now even a 30 40 mg oxy wont even touch me when they used to rock me.  So even though it's hard  avoid fent or accept that it sucks and work with it. 

Using subs or buprenorphine to replce H isnt going to drop your tolerance unless you use very small amounts just to avoid the worst of the worst WDs like 1/4 or half strips instead of the whole thing.  It also takes time for your tollerance to drop your brain needs to function and adapt to working without opioids or atleast extremely small amounts with breaks so you don't dose every day. 

So honestly the only way to drop your tollerance is time and removing most if not all the opioids from your body and not expecting to switch from one form to another to make it work like new agaiin. 

Are you getting tar or china white or what? I don't know what you are getting or what you are being ecposed to.  I can tell real H immediately as soon as it enters my body andd its extreamly hard to find here now.  Any of the chunky stufff is certainly cut with fent.  So the beat advice I can give is to  bite the bulle andt cut down space it out and hopefully get to the point where you can get through WDs and wait for your tollerance to drop.  I would say it takes a good 2 to 3 months of a serious reduction to get it back down where you would start to notice and for some of my friends about 6 months or more .  like I said my tollerance is so high that I need to seak out lethal stuff that will OD someone who doesn't use a lot on just a point 1 where I'm doing point 4 or 5 just to feel but I dont suggest switching to stronger and stronger stuff thats just dangerous.  

Also be aware that if you do drop your tollerance and want to keep getting that rush don't always do the same amount cuz it will go right back up if you dont space it out or keep increasibg your doses.  And know that you could OD pretty quick if you stop for a few months and go back to the amounts you are doing now.",1

I just research ahead to my options and generally avoid eatting out.  Look for local and international markets where you can buy oatmeal, sandwich materials, and snacks to keep with you.  Also, plan ahead with what you bring.  I always bring packaged food with me and haven't had any problems bringing it in. 

The BEST phrases to know in Japanese for food allergies are (typed phonetically not correctly, I know... I see you weebs out there judging):
- (picture of food item on phone) ga arimasen.   Literally - ______ I don't/can't have.  Ex. „Ç¢„Éú„Ç´„Éâ„Åå„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åõ„Çì . (Avocados I don't have)
- (food picture again) watashi wa arerugi des
Literally - ______ I have an allergy. ---&gt; ÁßÅ„ÅØ„Ç¢„É¨„É´„ÇÆ„Åß„Åô. 

Other helpful info - Japan allows you to bring one epipen with you into the country on each visit.  You can get traveled insurance as well which, depending on what coverage you choose, could help with any unexpected medical emergencies that may occur.  Emergency #119 is the equivalent to 911 in the US.  Ambulances are not 24/7, usually 8am-5pm depending on location.  Taxis are your best bet out of those hours.  Medical care is substantially cheaper so medical bills are miniscule compared to the US.  Over the counter drugs (like claratin, tylenol, ect.) aren't common and most have to be prescribed by a doctor.  Be sure to bring any meds you need with you (just not marijuana or anything oxycodon related...) as you likely won't find an exact replica.  

I know it's a lot, but all this said to say - have a blast and travel well!  Japan is amazing and, while not accomodating with food choices, the country is rich and full of life and amazing things to see and experience.  Just take that extra time to plan well so nothing will get in your way of having a safe and memorable trip!üòä",1

Also, disclaimer: I'm not personally qualified to testify about any of this. I'm repeating what I've read and heard from others whom I presume are so qualified.

1) Anyone authorized to give medicine to patients is taught the Five Rights: Right patient, right drug, right time, right dose, and right route. As part of that regimen, it is Marta's duty to make sure she's administering the right drug in the right dose, and she failed at that. This bosh about 'tincture' and 'viscosity' or whatever does not wash. If that was true, then she should have immediately detected that something was wrong with the labelling. It just doesn't work. It's a clumsy and implausible contrivance made up by people who know little or nothing about nursing for the sake of a cute plot device -- which, unfortunately, is central and key to the story, and thereby diminishes the entire thing.

2) Leaving her bag unattended. A nurse is responsible at all times for all tools and materials associated with their work, and this must never be left unattended, never mind left behind. There could have been many ways to plausibly separate Marta from her bag, but the one they used was not among them. It is grossly irresponsible.

3) Intravenously adminstered drugs enter the bloodstream directly and take effect **immediately**. Even if we hadn't been told, the visual evidence on screen makes it obvious that this was an IV injection, as the drugs were administered through a catheter instead of directly into the skin. (In any case, heroin has to be taken IV.) There would have been no delayed effect, but instead immediate effect. He didn't have ten minutes. He had more like ten **seconds**. A lethal dose of morphine is typically 200 mg or higher, for someone who is not acclimated to it. (For addicts, it might be as high as 2 g.)

4) There wasn't even 100 mg available to give him, as the bottle could not have contained more than 50 mg.

5) The lowest concetration of the pain-killer Toradol (ketorolac) is 15 mg/cc, and the dosage for an 85-year-old man is just 1 cc at that lowest concentration (15 cc). It's inconceivable that Harlan would have been prescribed 100 mg of the stuff per dose. The dosage attested in the film is medical malpractice.

6) Ketorolac is not to be administered for more than five days. Marta didn't say that Harlan injured his shoulder ""last week"", but instead ""about a week ago"" -- too far in the past to still be receiving this drug.

7) An overdose of morhine is not inherently fatal, if you have active respiratory support. Even if Harlan really had received a potentially lethal overdose, Marta calling 911 and giving CPR would have been enough to save him.

8) The film wants us to believe that Harlan had no hope and only ten minutes, but also that Ransom had every intent to kill Fran (which he did), but that she was still talking two hours after he injected her with a lethal dose. This does not add up at all, except with the most implausible assumptions.

More: Blood is only red while it's still fresh. The spot on Marta's shoe would have been brown, not red, and would have been difficult to identify as blood from a visual inspection alone. Given that most spots on footwear will be brown, it's highly implausible that anyone would have taken any note of the spot.

There are other errors in the film, too, including legal and geographical, but those are not important to the plot. These medical issues, are, and that's very regrettable.",1

Now how would that be a chess move to effect the US (without hurting anyone to. Not saying they didn't kill bc they did but first move was burn all poppy) poppy is used to produce opium an then heroin or pharmaceuticals. 

I'm sure most of you have seen the graph of opium/poppy production in afganistan. 2001 is almost non existing. I have friends who helped guard am build irrigation to those same poppyfields. Going to war Thinking they wanted to get back at the people behind 9 1 1. In reality some were sent to rebuild an guard the poppy. Coincidentally as the poppy started growing again in afganistan  (with nato/US guard) a huge influx came from (somewhere?) Into the USA...

then my *theory* is....we had control of oil,poppy ect in afganistan. So CHINA felt cut out,possibly Mexico too and started manufacturing high grade fetanyl an shipping/smuggling to the US. Knowing its stronger,cheaper an more people will want it. Even if more die,they don't care. There's still a constant supply asking for more. After 9 1 1 so many became addicted.

So maybe I also inherited her iron liver cause it takes a TON of alcohol to get me weird too.",2
423,2020-03-02 02:17:49+00:00,"Absolutely, yes. Making meth (or coke, heroin, etc) legal and regulated will do a variety of things:

The bad thing it'll do is get more people to use these drugs in the first place. History shows that when we legalize simething, it almost always gets used more. People like drugs, but are scared of a few things: the health effects, the legal consequences, and the social stigma. Legalization will drastically reduce all three.

The GOOD things it'd do are numerous. A common one you'll hear is that it makes it easier to get treatment for addiction, and that's very true. Nobody gets disowned by their family for seeking addiction counseling for nicotine or alcohol (well, a few do for alcohol. We'll get to that in a moment). Nobody worries about getting arrested for it. That makes it much less daunting to seek help for those addictions - but if you seek help for a heroin addiction? Say goodbye to your job, most of your friends, some of your family, and you even risk legal trouble in some places. The consequences of trying to *not* be addicted, once you already are, can seem *too high*. That's a pretty fucked up system.

It'll also make it medically safer to do these drugs. Street drugs being cut or laced (mixed with other substances) is a very common problem. Sometimes these substances are benign and just lower the potency of a drug. This is bad because it leads to people thinking they have a higher tolerance than they really do, and then overdosing when they try to do the same amount of the drug when it's *not* cut with something (a gram of pure coke is a lot more dangerous than a gram of coke that's 70% flour). It can also be cut with something poisonous (drain cleaner) or with a stronger, cheaper drug (lots of street opiates are cut with Fetanyl, which is extremely potent in very low doses. If the producer accidentally gets too much Fet in your heroin/Oxy/etc, then you can die of an overdose).

Legalization prevents those kinds of ODs and poisonings.

Legalization will, like I said earlier, keep families and friend groups together. Is weed legal where you live? How about gay marriage? Where I live those things have become *enormously* more acceptable since they were legalized. Your family won't disown you for smoking weed or for being gay anymore. That's good for both the user, and for the family/friends.

Legalization will make it safer to buy drugs. Don't gotta risk seeing a sketchy dealer when you can pick your drugs up at the corner store. Nobody's gonna get shot or stabbed or robbed trying to buy drugs anymore.

Along those lines - you know all those drug cartels all over the world? The ones that murder thousands of people every year, that buy elections and police departments? Nobody likes buying from them. Nobody who *can* buy legal weed buys cartel weed anymore. Nobody will buy cartel coke or anything else, and they'll go out out business (or at least the scope of their business will be drastically reduced).

If we were to address other problems in society (such as access and affordability of healthcare, both physical and mental) then usage rates would decline as well, as less people would feel they have no other options than to use drugs.

Oh, and of course we can tax drugs and use that money to fund schools, healthcare, environmental restoration, and lots of other stuff.

There's only one downside to legalization and the upsides dwarf it.",1

430,2020-03-01 10:44:31+00:00,"A lot of people OD on heroin because the concentration varies. They don't know how much they need to take before they will feel an effect, because every batch they get is different. Sometimes street drugs are also laced with other drugs like fetanayl they were not expecting. A lot of overdoses are accidental and based on these variations. 

If we were to be providing heroin then we could ensure that it was free of any of the fillers and unsafe chemicals currently in street drugs. A safe dosage could also be ensured, so overdoses would probably go down significantly. 

It is unlikely in my opinion that it would lower the rate of addiction and therefore homelessness. I believe the argument for legalizing drugs is not that it would reduce addiction but simply that it would reduce death and harm to addicts. If it were to reduce addiction it's because some research has shown that people lost interest in marijuana once it became legalized. They were more interested in the appeal of doing something taboo or illegal and once it became legalized it was no longer ""cool"".

Drugs like MDMA, marijuana and psilocybin mushroom are generally safe and non-addictive. They are usually pure and unlikely to be laced with anything else even when bought illegally. The rates of addiction and death would probably not be significantly altered for these substances. 

Drugs like heroin, crack cocaine, methamphetamine and desomorphine would be substantially safer to use if quality and dosage were ensured. 

Drugs like LSD and cocaine are more dangerous for their effects than for what they contain. Bad trips on LSD can lead to people getting hurt, but the risk of overdose itself is extremely unlikely. Cocaine overdoses tend to fluctuate greatly as does the quality of the drug. 

Overall I would say that legalizing drugs like marijuana and psilocybin would probably have no great harm to society. The biggest effect would probably be the tax dollars they could bring in. 

Legalizing MDMA, LSD and cocaine may have some marginal increase in hospitalizations (people thinking there is something wrong with them even if there isn't is also a common occurrence due to bad trips but rates of overdose and addiction would probably still remain rare. Certain crimes may increase depending upon the reaction people would have on a psychoactive substance or stimulant. 

Legalizing heroin, meth and desomorphine would probably reduce overdoses but raise addiction levels in my opinion. People often turn to opiods to self-medicate, or because they became addicted to prescribed painkillers. These are addictive substances that people rely on to deal with chronic pain. 

Making Fetanyl an accessible street drug in my opinion, will simply kill people. I do not see it ending well.",1

435,2020-03-01 07:02:10+00:00," Ao instalar o estado t√≠pico de pr√©-golpe, [Jair ](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/jair-bolsonaro/)[Bolsonaro](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/jair-bolsonaro/) viu sair de cena o caso do [miliciano Adriano da N√≥brega](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/ex-pm-trabalhava-para-bicheiro-quando-foi-heroi-de-bolsonaro-diz-depoimento.shtml). Uma vit√≥ria. Parcial, mas vit√≥ria. A poss√≠vel investiga√ß√£o e a apreens√£o dos 13 celulares do fugitivo levaram Bolsonaro a mostrar-se, mais do que apreensivo, temeroso mesmo. O miliciano, √© claro, n√£o foi por ele defendido e homenageado na C√¢mara sen√£o por conveni√™ncias especiais para faz√™-lo.

 Pelo visto, tamb√©m a pol√≠cia e o Minist√©rio P√∫blico sentiram-se aliviados com o sumi√ßo do caso.

 Execu√ß√µes para silenciar sempre t√™m tratamento recalcitrante nas √°reas investigativa e judici√°ria. S√£o perigosas ou vantajosas.

 Outros sil√™ncios, nem sugiro onde, t√™m l√° suas explica√ß√µes, nem sugiro quais. Coisas que ficam muito bem no recente patamar a que o desastre nacional nos leva.

 O estado t√≠pico de golpismo n√£o √© a certeza de golpe. √â a situa√ß√£o em que um segmento pol√≠tico ou militar ‚Äîe em geral ambos‚Äî for√ßa circunst√¢ncias contr√°rias √† integridade institucional, cujo eventual abalo deixa, a√≠ sim, o caminho aberto para a tentativa de um golpe. A rea√ß√£o a movimentos nesse sentido ainda √© insuficiente e t√≠mida, em compara√ß√£o com a persist√™ncia de Bolsonaro e dos seus pr√≥ximos na transgress√£o dos respectivos limites legais, de decoro e j√° constitucionais.

  A ocorr√™ncia, nos √∫ltimos dias, n√£o de atos isolados por parte de Bolsonaro [e Augusto Heleno](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/general-heleno-diz-que-bolsonaro-e-alvo-de-parlamentarismo-branco-na-discussao-sobre-orcamento.shtml), entre outros, mas de uma conjuga√ß√£o intencional e pr√©via, √© uma hip√≥tese indescart√°vel. Se o general n√£o previu o vazamento de suas palavras contra o Congresso, nem por isso √© menos certo que transmitia aos ministros Paulo Guedes e Luiz Eduardo Ramos a posi√ß√£o de romper as negocia√ß√µes com os parlamentares sobre o Or√ßamento, elevando a crise. Para a qual dava em seguida a solu√ß√£o, em palavra est√∫pida com o significado de dane-se, ferre-se, arrebente-se o Congresso.

 Ao pr√≥prio Bolsonaro, em reuni√£o palaciana a pretexto do problema criado com parlamentares, o mesmo general prop√µe ""chamar o povo para as ruas"". A sugest√£o n√£o √© refutada por nenhum palaciano, civil ou militar. E √© em obedi√™ncia a ela, com cita√ß√£o expl√≠cita ao mesmo general, que surge [o chamado para uma passeata, em 15 de mar√ßo, de apoio a Bolsonaro e contra o Congresso e o Supremo Tribunal Federal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/ato-com-grupos-autoritarios-e-incentivado-por-deputados-bolsonaristas-e-gera-repudio.shtml). N√£o √© cr√≠vel que a manifesta√ß√£o e a convoca√ß√£o tivessem gera√ß√£o espont√¢nea, tanto mais que difundidas na internet por um direitista radical ligado a Bolsonaro.

 O mais novo problema criado por Augusto Heleno exigia de Bolsonaro cuidado e sil√™ncio sobre a provoca√ß√£o convocada. Fez o oposto. N√£o por desaten√ß√£o. Estava com os filhos pol√≠ticos, e mais um, em reuni√£o permanente no Carnaval. A atestar que o chamado contra o Congresso e o Supremo √© para valer, passava a ser o pr√≥prio Bolsonaro a pass√°-lo aos habituados a espalh√°-lo pa√≠s afora.

 Vinda a repercuss√£o, Bolsonaro faz o que sabe: [ataca a imprensa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/bolsonaro-elogia-cnn-brasil-e-defende-boicote-a-midia-que-mente.shtml), acusando-a de difundir como atual uma mensagem sua de 2015. Mas o v√≠deo inclui cita√ß√£o √† facada que levou em 2018. Faz assim como a afirma√ß√£o de que [Fl√°vio ](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/flavio-bolsonaro/)[Bolsonaro](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/flavio-bolsonaro/) condecorou um Adriano da N√≥brega isento de qualquer condena√ß√£o ‚Äîmas Fl√°vio precisou ir ao pres√≠dio para entregar-lhe a medalha. Desmentidos de Bolsonaro n√£o s√£o verdades, s√£o palha√ßadas morais.

 Quem quiser que duvide, mas o chamado ao povo contra o Congresso e o Supremo tem o odor palaciano. Foi talvez precipitado pelos riscos impl√≠citos no assassinato emudecedor do miliciano e tamb√©m ex-capit√£o Adriano da N√≥brega. Se n√£o houve precipita√ß√£o intencional, o efeito colateral prestou o mesmo servi√ßo. Sem diminuir o efeito principal, de evidenciar o avan√ßo para a situa√ß√£o t√≠pica do golpismo ‚Äîe a rea√ß√£o t√≠mida ou intimidada das institui√ß√µes que podem e devem reagir mais do que √† altura.",1

438,2020-03-01 02:40:16+00:00,"Here we go:
The Bush family is an American Cartel family.

George Bush Jr is a member of skull n bones, a secret society that had many elites within the ranks.

 His father ran the CIA. 

I believe he saw the effects of the opioid epidemic post Vietnam and the $$$ the CIA made during the time through smuggling operations using GI bodybags for transport (plot point in so many movies).

Motive: Supply opioids to the largest drug market.
Means:  CIA and presidency, no one leaves the CIA even during presidency. And the president weilds the might of the military
How it happened:
Both Bush Sr and Bush Jr dealt with conflicts in the middle East. Specifically Afghanistan where at least 50% of the world's poppy is grown but I've seen stats for 80%. Now at war, you can control the people using fear and extort them for their resources: opium. Both Bush's did it. 

It's 4-D chess with everything making a profit. 
Sell guns for war
Sell drugs to Americans
Sell raw materials to Big Pharma, (invest in big pharma stock and underprice your raw materials)
Get inaccessible state owned oil for American use

Afghanistan was Russia's Vietnam. And just like our Vietnam, the Russian populous dealt with an opioid problem afterward(compounded/overlooked due to Soviet collapse). By design or not, it's effective tactic. And now in the present, they have the krokodil(opioid) issue like America has the fentnyl issue. 

I think with the Skull and Bones high society connections; Intel from the CIA and the power the federal government wields allowed the bushes to pull this off and run the world's biggest drug cartel. 

Any current military guys do any tours that may back ANY of this up?",1
