#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Sicherlich steht da das man Abzesse oder Lungenentzündung bekommt aber das sind alles Probleme die von minderwertigem Heroin oder mangelnder Hygiene z.B beim Spritzen hervorgerufen werden. Natürlich macht das Heroin nicht gesund und empfehlenswert aber diese ständige Agenda, das das Zeug in kürzester Zeit deinen Körper zerstört ist einfach Unsinn. Heroin ist ein Opioid wie die ganzen anderen auch, es gibt abertausende Menschen die jahrelang mit Opioiden behandelt werden; Oxycodon, Morphin, Hydromorphon, Fentanyl... Alles der selbe Kram am Ende, trotzdem wird Heroin durch stigmatisierung auf eine Art Podest gehoben und das ist lächerlich.

Der einzige Sinn den Waffen haben ist das Töten oder verletzen von Menschen. Außerdem ist es jawohl erwiesen, das das Waffenverbot etwas bringt. Heroin und andere Drogen werden Trotzdem konsumiert in unfassbaren Mengen und das Verbot hilft oder rettet niemandem vor dem bösen Konsum. Wer Drogen konsumieren will der wird das tun, ob illegal oder nicht. Demnach sind Drogen eine gesellschaftliche Realität und auch wenn der Staat es lieber hätte wenn keiner Konsumiert, so muss man einfach anerkennen das das utopisch ist und versuchen Schadensminderung durch Qualitätskontrollen, Beratungen, Therapien, kontrollierte Abgabe...etc zu erreichen.

Ja wundert mich jetzt auch irgendwie gar nicht das Cyankali verboten ist. Der einzige Zweck den eine Privatperson daraus ziehen könnte sind die giftigen Eigenschaften und mal abgesehen davon besteht wohl keine Nachfrage danach und ich denke ein Verbot wird auch etwas bringen. Darin liegt der Unterschied.
Was ist den mit Hydromorphon das du vom Doktor bekommst? Ist das auch Gift? Ist auch ein Opioid das sogar 3-4x stärker ist. Bekommt die Krebskranke Oma Gift durch ihre Fentanylpflaster? Ist doch 50x stärker.


Außerdem ist es verdammt schwierig sich mit Heroin überzudosieren solange man nicht spritzt, und selbst beim Spritzen kommen die meisten ODs wahrscheinlich dadurch zustande dass die Potenz des Straßenheroins so variabel ist.

I've been on H for about 10 years now so I'm sure I can easily understand your situation and emotions from that time. I'm sure you did some shady shit and beside the fact that that behavior is the damn nature of capitalism (on drugs if you so will) the argument that h is to blame doesn't hold any water because when heroin is legal and easily available all that shit you described becomes pointless and unnecessary. 

I don't blame drugs for my situation, the dependancies definitely had and will always have an impact but in truth Prohibition carries most of the blame. Here's why: I get my heroin (diamorphin + Substitol) from the German state. I don't need to deal or steal to finance my meds. I don't have insane uneducated medical personnel shaming me or trying to make me feel bad for my substance use. 

One last tip (this is one of the most important, enlightening and helpful books I've read in my life):

I recommend you read Chasing the Scream by Johann Hari. It covers everything from the Harrison Act of 1915 that quasi outlawed h and coke all the way to 2015 where it was published. I'm sure you've heard of Anslinger (the anti Marijuana guy) but you're definitely unaware of his impact on all our lifes even today and despite being clean. It talks about Arnold Rothstein, Billie Holiday, scientists like Bruce K. Alexander, Robert K. Siegel and Gabor Mate. These names will mean a lot to you after you're done reading. 

Drugs are not completely faultless but the majority share of blame for all the pain and hardship will always go to the situation that Prohibition creates. Think about alcohol Prohibition in the 1920's. Major increase in Organized Crime as well as adulterated possibly deadly product. All this would (have completely) disappear(ed) after legalization of alcohol. You don't have hitmen from Bud Light going after Heineken guys.

I'll leave some links here for you and I wish you all the best!

CREST is also an old naming you should find a scleroderma specialist on [scleroderma.org](https://scleroderma.org). Sadly unless they specialize in the disease they don't know enough to be diagnosing or treating. Since scleroderma is based on symptom diagnosis. They look at your symptoms to see the type of scleroderma. So scleroderma breaks down into two branches localized scleroderma affecting the skin and underlying tissues and systemic scleroderma which affects the organs as well. With systemic scleroderma, there are branches off for sine scleroderma (only internal), limited scleroderma (Use to be CREST), and diffuse systemic scleroderma. The localized branch breaks into morphea and linear scleroderma. Morphea can break down even more into subtypes. ANA is not a definite way to diagnose you get diagnosed based on symptoms. The antibody tests can give an idea of potential progression only but it does not mean you even have it if you have the antibodies. Plus you're missing antibodies for scleroderma again since your doctor is not a specialist they don't know all the ones to look for. Another test to be done to get you under the scleroderma umbrella is a biopsy of affected skin however these tests are old so they may say positive for morphea or positive for excess collagen if it's positive this just means any form of scleroderma it does not mean you have morphea it's just how they use to label the skin. You can also look for abnormally nailbed capillaries. So my advice with you being young like myself is to get yourself to a specialist for diagnosis and treatment. Rituximab infusion is a normal treatment but it's more on the extreme end and not usually ever the starting point of treatment especially based on the symptoms you listed. Feel free to ask me questions or even DM it sucks this is such a rare disease with a lot of information lacking id recommend looking at [scleroderma.org](https://scleroderma.org) where you can also find a doctor close to you and the scleroderma education project.

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

For sure. My sister in law would probably be alive had the  heroin not been cut with fetanyl, she wouldn't have had an addition had she not been over prescribed opioids for pain, the industry profiting in her and others and the Sacklers skating with a slap on the wrist.... Getting stuck on those details can be really painful. I try to tell myself it doesn't change what happened, it's done. Otherwise the injustice of it all is crushing. Preventative death is so frustrating, I can imagine you're feeling similarly.

My wife and I tried using it as an opportunity to lean about addicts and see them as sick people needing help, not bad people needing punishment. Some family members bought into the healing through educating and empathy process...some chose alcohol and avoidance or anger.

49,2021-10-29 22:36:46+00:00,"V zgodnjem 20. stoletju so razvite države že začela strogo regulirati vse opiate. Najbolj splošna in popularna uporaba laudanuma (pravzaprav priprava opija - učinki heroina so precej hujši in odvisnost dosti prej privede do dna) je bila v drugi polovici 19. stoletja, njegovi negativni učinki pa so bili splošno znani že od druge polovice 18. stoletja. 

Kako to, da je tako nevarna droga bila tako popularno zdravilo? Ker praktično ni bilo alternative za kontroliranje bolečine pri pacientih, opiati pa so še danes najbolj učinkovita substanca. Paracetamol (lekadol) je bil izumljen šele konec 19. stoletja. Zelo pogosta uporaba laudanuma je bila proti driski, ki je bila zaradi neurejenih kanalizacij v evropskih mestih zelo pogosto. Alternativa je pač bila smrt. 

Podobno je danes; edina alternativa smrti pri Covidu je, da se cepiš. Problem je edino, da se moramo cepiti vsi, ne samo tisti, ki nas Covid mogoče bolj skrbi kot druge. Ni ključna smrtnost ene osebe, ampak je problem dvig smrti v populaciji in s tem kolaps bolnišničnih sistemov (pa verjetno še kakšnih drugih, če postane situacija res ekstremna). 

Mimogrede, kako to, da imamo na svetu še vedno epidemije opiatov, kljub temu, da vsi vemo, da opiati vodijo v odvisnost? Če bi od cepiva bil pijan, bi svet (še posebej pa Slovenija) že davno bil precepljen.",1

They are sick people who are responsible for giving the opiate epidemic a good push into what it is today.

The fact is that yes I made the choice ultimately but they made sure the drug flooded my hometown to put that choice there. No I was taken away from my mom at a young age due to her abusing me and using drugs. I never saw her addiction for what it was as a child and you have a high chance of becoming addicted yourself as a child of an addict.. I wanted to bond with my mom who was never there and using was a way to do that. if heroin and Oxycotin never entered our lives due Purdue I can say 100% I wouldn't of been addicted.

The staff were all so nice and considerate, they all knew what I was there for so no awkward explaining. I was surprised the first form I had to fill out was a ""fetal death document"" which kinda threw me off, but that was the only off putting thing. For the actual procedure, I walked back to the OR and layed down, they first game me Versed and Fentany (calming/pain meds) which made me really sleepy and then pushed Propofol. The next thing I knew, I woke up in recovery and the post op nurse was a literal angel. She talked to me about her past miscarriage and was just so nice. She helped me get dressed and wheeled me out to my husband. All in all I was there for 3 hours total so pretty quick. I started having some mild cramping on the ride home. I got home and ate breakfast and took a Percocet to stay on top of the pain. Bleeding has been very mild so far. Mostly watery pink on my pad, no clots or anything (sorry TMI). I've just been laying in bed on my heating pad and taking it easy. I'm at 5 and half hours since I took the percocet and cramping is just barely faint. So overall okay, but I know it's still early!

101,2021-10-27 16:03:28+00:00,"Nein, sehe ich nicht so. Es ist eher so das in deiner Argumentation Dinge wild durcheinander geworfen werden, bzw. die Definition von legal viel zu unscharf benutzt wird. 

1. Heroin ist nicht legalisiert (zumindest nicht in dem Sinne in dem es in der Cannabisdebatte gefordert wird). Menschen können unter hohen Auflagen in wenigen Städten in Deutschland mit Diamorphin substituiert werden. Das Projekt lief bis 2009, seitdem kann es prinzipiell ohne Sondergenehmigung ausgeweitet werden. ABER die Auflagen sind so hoch, dass es in der Praxis kaum umsetzbar ist, speziell in dünner besetzten Gebieten (Modellstädte waren alles Ballungsräume, und trotzdem waren es 2009 nur 277). Selbst die traditionellen Substitute (Meta, Pola, Subutex…) sind in einigen Gegenden Deutschlands kaum zu kriegen weil sich immer mehr niedergelassene Ärzte aus der Substitution zurückziehen. 

2. Wenn das die von dir angestrebte Legalisierung für Cannabis sein soll, kannste dich entspannen. Du bekommst deutlich leichter Cannabis als Heroin auf Rezept in Deutschland. 

3. Die von dir immer wieder beschworenen Unreinheiten im Cannabis sind das bisher schwächste Argument was ich im Bezug auf die Legalisierungsdebatte gehört habe. Da finde ich Argumente wie zB die Nutzer aus dem kriminellen Milieu rauszuhalten, staatliche Einnahmen durch Besteuerung, Entlastung der Justiz, bessere Entkriminalisierung der Nutzer usw. deutlich überzeugender. 

Es gibt sicherlich stichhaltige Argumente für eine Legalisierung und auch Praxisbeispiele dafür. Aber ich sehe keinen einzigen medizinischen Vorteil bei der Freigabe der halluzinogen Anteile. Im Gegenteil, es mehren sich Hinweise die die negativen Konsequenzen, vor allem für die Hirnentwicklung von Heranwachsenden belegen, ebenso wie für das auslösen von psychotischen Episoden",1

125,2021-10-27 00:00:29+00:00,"Isto é uma discussão muito longa honestamente, e vou me esquecer de pontos fulcrais a escrever isto...   
Eu li o livro do Dr. Carl Hart, e já li vários artigos cientificos no tema. Não sou nenhum médico/cientista da àrea da neuropsicologia, mas fiquei covencido com os argumentos apresentados. Recomendo vivamente a leitura.

Eu era contra a legalização de todas as drogas e agora sou a favor. Algumas das razões que me convenceram foram: 

O problema das drogas é fundamentalmente um problema humanístico e não de saúde.

O problema não é das drogas, é das pessoas. Aposto que muitos neste sub já beberam alcool, fumaram cannabis, tomaram mdma, amphetaminas ou metaphetaminas. A vida continuou e não tiveram quaisquer impactos negativos para a sua vida, não têm problemas de adição, elas vão ao trabalho igual, cuidam da sua familia e contribuem para a sociedade. Isto é o caso para 90% das pessoas que consomem todo o tipo de drogas (incluindo as ""pesadas""). Só quando o consumo interfere negativamente na vida das pessoas e as pessoas continuam a consumir é que é considerado um problema de adição. (Há na realidade várias definições científicas de adição, esta é a que considero mais adequada)  
Por exemplo se beberes uma cerveja ao final do dia e não tiveres impactos negativos na tua vida ou na vida dos outros não há problema em fazê-lo. Isto de um ponto de vista humanistico, claro que estás a deteriorar a tua saúde, mas estavas a por a tua saúde mais em risco se o alcool fosse ilegal e tivesses a beber uma bebida destilada às três pancadas e podias morrer de overdose pois não sabias o que continha, a sua concentração, ou se foi destilada corretamente. Se achas que estou a exagerar basta procurar as mortes que houve durante a lei seca nos estados unidos por causa desta brincadeira.

As mortes por overdose de droga são, na maioria, por falta de conhecimento do que se está a tomar e das doses apropriadas. Um risco de fentanyl é 100x mais potente que um risco de heroína, logo se estás a tomar fentanyl a pensar que é heroina e ainda juntas alcool á mistura o resultado nunca é bom.

Random thoughts: A distinção de drogas leves e pesadas é ténue, e é imposta pela sociedade e não pela ciência. Se fores bem a ver a cocaina e a heroina são extraidas de plantas naturais que são as folhas de coca e a papoila do ópio. São também drogas usadas à centenas de anos... Diferenciar cocaina de crack, meth de alguns medicamentos para a hiperatividade são alguns exemplos que tens de drogas que são iguais mas a sua imagem para a sociedade é tão diferente.

Podia estar aqui a escrever mais razões para a legalização e fundamentar melhor as ideias mas acho que não vale a pena. Se te interessares tens sempre artigos cientificos e livros que podes ler sobre o assunto e formares as tuas próprias opiniões. Btw tou no teclado do UK com layout PT portanto acentos e merdas é lixado, peço desculpa ao camões.  


Além disso eu posso estar errado sobre tudo isto e o melhor é proibir as pessoas de tomarem qualquer risco para a sua saúde. Vamos banir o McDonalds, andar de moto, drogas, bicicletas, atravessar passadeiras, skydiving, surfar ondas gigantes e pequenas, kickbox, ginásio, etc.... Ficamos em casa que de certeza é o que apresenta menos risco para a saúde.",2

Letting them sleep in parks is one of them. Handing them cash below a bridge is another. The real issue is people think it's the governments initiative to provide some assistance to people that have continually made bad choices in their lives and continue to make them. Free will is a he'll of a thing. Like a diabetic . The doctors says stop drinking soda you're going to develop immune compromised diseases. Then they get it and now medicine is expensive. Now tax dollars need to pay for their inability to follow a recommendation? How about start with the individual taking responsibility before we start making laws and burdening our community. It only creates resentment. 

I've worked with people that actually provide help to homeless brothers and sisters, specifically in Denver snd Austin since its rampant there. They have to send out crews to clean up the parks due to the amount if drug periphenelia laying abouts. It's dangerous. No one forced them to abuse their bodies but then again we excuse the pharmaceutical companies for freely producing and doctors for freely prescribing. Is it not their family also for freely making them? Or the cartels for facilitating? Or China for improving all the fentenyl?   They are symptoms of a deeper rooted societal concern with eliminating the true logos- reason and wisdom from our every day dialogue. Have compassion and love but that means being wise about it. 

Don't make this into am economic issue like capitalism= evil.  It's ridiculous for that paradigm is literally why we live longer and for most a better quality of life as a whole. Ofcourse there are poor people and it's our responsibility as a community to react to that need. Clothe, feed, visit...are you giving up everything to help them? You expect me to? The government and its employees making shit wages? 

We need to Stop making generalist assumptions about people especially on a thread and have real conversations. The reality is most people in the world want to end suffering and have everyone live a wonderful life. That entails equality of outcome which is literally socialist dictatorship. No thanks. The blood spilled still runs in Europe, Asia and the America's. 

We are I heirs of a great sin and we will toil and pain in labor. Maybe read genesis again. Through suffering we are divinized. Jesus came to this world and the world beat him to a pulp and killed him for speaking truth... why would you think creatures created in his image and likeness be treated any differently? He died for our sins but he also said this world will hate you ...

I literally have to stand around with my thumb in my hole in my abdomen to Keep whatever fatty tissue back on the right side. It won’t stay anymore. When they are protruded, they are only about the size of a ping pong ball. However, once a hernia gets to about 4cm that is the diameter of intestines and that’s when you start running high risks of actual intestine coming through and potentially having the blood supply to a section of intestine cut off. This is why it becomes a medical emergency, because with no blood that section of intestine will die quickly and then you are pretty screwed.

I literally just went to my doctor and said time to fix this, and we ordered the imaging a surgeon needs to fix it, which was an ultrasound. Ultrasound shows three hernia, one is about 2.5 cm and the other two are about 2cm. 

I don’t know how a baseball sized mass of things that should be inside your abdominal wall, popping through to the other side, is not totally freaking you out, but I’m fixing mine before it gets there no questions asked and then i can actually do two hand things again since my thumb-in-ab-wall will finally be free.

Surgery is nothing. I had my first surgery a few months ago and now I’ll do anything. It goes like this:

You in a hospital gown and they are getting an iv going and give you some anxiety meds and whatnot. When is time to go to the OR they start rolling you and as you get closer the lights get brighter and brighter and it gets colder and colder then you go through dots into a big room and you can see there’s a a bunch of people here to help you and someone immediately is approaching you with an oxygen mask telling you to take a deep breath before the bed has even come to a complete stop, you are nervous and take a deep breath and he says deeper bud, then start counting down from 100 - so you’re like okay breeeeesaaaattthhhheee - bed is slowly parking into place and 100… 99 …

BAM you wake up in recovery area with a nurse at your side asking you if you have pain and pumping you with fentenyl or dialaudid and hours has gone by its all done and you are feeling effing great yes please can i have another one of those?

It just.. you don’t have time to worry and then it’s over before you knew they even actually started.",1

Infantry has their mono intake, iirc for your batch there's actually a mono infantry coy where Kestrel Coy would've been. I heard that Mohawk coy was mono intake as well but I can't rly confirm that. Mono infantry would usually be sufficient manpower for the unit alr, unless there's a high OOT rate, in which the unit will request to CMPB for direct enlistees to get posted there as well. 

I don't know what is the OOT rate for the mono intake coy, so I can't guarantee anything for you.

Inclusive, foi jogos vorazes q criou essa ideia de q se tiver muitas salas, as pessoas optam pelo filme. Acho q foi no terceiro filme do jogos vorazes,  reclamaram q tinha salas demais. Vingadores idem.

Até achei uma matéria q ajuda na discussão [materia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/04/cineastas-brasileiros-veem-selvageria-na-estrategia-de-vingadores.shtml)

Acho q podemos concordar q estamos em um(dois) ano atipico, em q a logica mudou. Mas vamos pelo q costumava ser.

Mas em geral, lança um filme por semana no cinema. Isso dá 52 semanas, 52 filmes por ano, em media. Nas ferias ate lançavam 2.

Vc acha q os 6 ou 7 filmes de super heroi conseguem prejudicar os outros 40 e poucos tanto assim?!

E mais, a logica q eles deram ali na materia é: o cara vai no cinema, pq quer ir ver qualquer coisa, e chega lá e escolhe entre o q tem. Tu acha q é isso mesmo? Ou acha q as pessoas já vao com o filme escolhido?

Same with any opioid plenty of people Ik super fit and successful take a pill once every 3 or 4 monthes for a ""good day"". Herion is trickier cuz if you IV its gonna be REALLY good. 

If your actually interested read Carl Harts latest book. Hes a professor and author who occasionally snorts meth or heroin and isnt using it too often or hooked. Then he purposely got hooked on low dose morephine so he can talk about and understand withdrawal.

So yea. Herion like any opioid can be occasionally used. But very very commonly occasional use becomes a crouch for life and slowly a staple of it. If you let yourself into the life it swallows you up. ""If you gaze into the abyss the abyss gazes back"". If you really wanna try and opioid do something smaler ike kratom or morephine where you have uncut product and an exact dose. Dont use it to much and if you REALLLY like it flush it and run.

The black hole trying to pull me in is that I didn't know.  Because I didn't want to see it. I didn't ask.  I just assumed he had everything under control. I know he hid it from me, and I know that he would have denied it if I asked.  But maybe if I had opened a dialog by asking, he would have been reminded of how much he meant to me. And maybe he wouldn't have taken such a horrible reckless stupid risk.

Prva stvar - Bolesti zavisnosti u preko 70% slučajeva nemaju veze sa depresijom i zavisnici ne daju nikakve naznake da bi se ubili. Misliš da debeli Mirko pije i puši kao retard jer je depresivan??? 

Čak i što se tiče ljudi čije zavisnosti imaju veze sa begom od depresije i anksioznih poremećaja, ozbiljniji oblici zavisnosti svakako ne vode nigde nego u smrt i očaj. 
Naravno, postoje ljudi koji se drogiraju 20 godina i oporave se i ostave svoju drogu zauvek ali ako nakon toga i dalje misle da NISU bili retardi jer su bacali 20 godina života onda su još veći retardi. 

Druga stvar - Naravno da je bitno koliko ćeš da živiš - ne kažem ja, možda sutra poginem ali ako se ne desi to, zašto bi svojevoljno živeo 60 umesto 80?

Treća stvar - Unutrašnji mir? Druže ovde ima ljudi koji rade na gradjevini za 600 evra i 200 od tih 600 daju na cigare, alkohol, kladionicu itd. a deca im nemaju knjige za školu. Lično poznajem primere.

Ako misliš da supstance koje izazivaju bolesti zavisnosti mogu da pruže tebi ili bilo kome drugom UNUTRAŠNJI MIR, želim ti svu sreću u životu i sve najbolje, budi mi jak. 

I prijateljski savet : zajebi me tvoje evropske osetljivosti i takozvane empatije. Po ovim komentarima, ti si lik koji ne bi svom drugu rekao da je debeo jer bi ga uvredio tako, umesto da mu kažeš da je debeo i da mu pomogneš da smrša jer je to dobro za njega. 
Ko je zavisnik od cigara, alkohola, kokaina, heroina, i svih tih ZNAČAJNO ŠTETNIH droga - jebeni je retard i nema tu mesta za osetljivost. 
Podrška zavisnicima mora i treba da postoji ali samo kao dodatak na usmeravanje na uklanjanje tih bolesti zavisnosti. 

Toliko od mene, nadam se da si nešto naučio.",1

So funktionieren Opiate nicht. Es ist sehr schade, dass du nicht deine angedachte und adäquate Dosis bekommen hast (2-3x 20mg Oxycodon/Tag ist für Opiatnaive bei starken postoperativen Schmerzen ein guter Einstieg). 

Aber Opiate sind nach Wirkung (und Nebenwirkung) einzustellen und haben bis auf wenige Ausnahmen keine Höchstdosis per se. Da unterscheiden sich Opiate von z.B. Ibuprofen oder Paracetamol, die eine Tagesmaximaldosis haben, wo mehr Medikament nicht mehr Schmerzlinderung gibt.

Jemandem, der keine Vorgeschichte mit Opiatgebrauch hat, ungefiltert 400mg Oxy zu geben ist sehr bedenklich, das ist wahrscheinlich viel zu viel.  Andererseits, jemandem dessen Körper Opiate gewohnt ist oder der unter der o.g. Dosis noch Schmerzen und keine relevanten Nebenwirkungen einer Überdosierung zu haben, nicht mehr zu geben ist auch nicht gut. Man muss sich von unten an die Wirkung herantasten, hat aber nach oben praktisch kein Limit. Das braucht etwas Erfahrung, weil die Konsequenzen einer Überdosierung bei schneller Medikamentensteigerung oder nachlassenden Schmerzen und gleichbleibender Dosis fatal sein können. (Daher gibt es auch für manche Fälle elegantere Analgesiekonzepte als fest angesetzte langwirksame Opiate, die vom Patienten selbst gesteuert werden können und teilweise auch keine Opiate brauchen, z.B. Regionalanästhesie, patientenkontrollierte-Schmerzpumpen)

Ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass Medikamentendosen im KH nicht richtig oder zu spät gegeben werden und Ärzte/Pfleger, die nicht so viel Erfahrung mit Opiaten haben, eher vorsichtig sind. Macht es aber nicht besser. Hasse das System, nicht die Personen. Die meissten reissen sich den Arsch auf und sind einfach maximal unterbesetzt und/oder ausserhalb der Komfortzone ihrer Ausbildung. Der Burnout im Gesundheitssystem ist auch dadurch begründet, dass man dem eigenen hohen Anspruch, gute medizinische Versorgung zu bieten durch die Strukturen unseres Systems verhindert wird.

Ich hab also die beste Behandlung, die das Krankenhaus so zu bieten hat, erhalten. 

Und es war ... grottenschlecht. Nicht selten habe ich 2-3h auf Medikamentengabe oder Urinflaschen gewartet. Habe jetzt letzens erst erfahren dass, bei meiner Verletzung täglich Lymphdrainage im Krankenhaus gemacht werden muss, hab es nicht einmal erhalten was dazu geführt hat (laut Zweitmeinung von einem Sportmediziner) dass die Wiederherstellung der Beweglichkeit nun Ewigkeiten dauern wird.

Anstatt 3x täglich 20mg Oxycodon, wie auf dem Medikamentenplan angeordnet, habe ich tagelang nur 3x 5mg Tabletten bekommen und das obwohl ich permanent über Schmerzen gemeckert habe ""Herr Grower69 sie bekommen schon soviel Schmerzmittel, dass wir Angst haben dass sie bald nicht mehr atmen!""

Achja? 15mg Oxycodon übern ganzen Tag bei offenen Frakturen ist also sehr viel? Ein Blick in die Packungsbeilage des Medikaments zeigt ""Tagesmaximaldosis 400mg"". Zweitmeinung vom Sportmediziner ""Niemand muss solche Schmerzen erleiden, es baut sich ein Schmerzgedächtnis auf, welches zu chronischen Schmerzen führen kann und die Heilung negativ beeinflusst, des weiteren ist das eine psychische Belastung für den Patienten was wiederum auf das Personal überschlägt"".

Ich habe dann die leeren Pillenpackungen gesammelt um dem Chefarzt beweisen zu können, dass mir hier Medikamente unterschlagen werden. Waren natürlich alle überrascht und konnten sich das gar nicht erklären aber Konsequenzen hatte es keine. 

Muss man sich mal geben, da liegen Patienten mit Vernichtungsschmerz aufgrund von offenen Brüchen und Kompartmentsyndrom und Klinikmitarbeiter bedienen sich an deren Schmerzmedikation! 

Ich könnte fast unendlich weiter machen, nach meiner 2. OP wurde ich auf Station vergessen und habe 5h keine Schmerzmedikation bekommen, obwohl ich den Knopf im Zimmer gedrückt habe. Habe dann meine Freundin angerufen, die musste dann von zuhause aus ins Krankenhaus kommen damit ich ordentlich meine Medikamente kriege.

Kann jedem nur eine private Zusatzversicherung für stationäre Aufenthalte empfehlen, die paar € im Monat sind es doch wert, man liegt ja meistens doch wegen ernsteren Sachen dort.

You never opened your more metaphorical version of the envelope,  and it gave serious credence to the belief that many Americans had (and still have) that you were full of crap and hoping constituents and co-workers alike would just take your word for it.

Alot of anti-Trump whistleblowers like to compare themselves to the guys at the Washington Post who broke Watergate but they forget the Watergate story had all its I's dotted and all its T's crossed. The editors at the Post weren't going to print the story without the leaker (""Deepthroat"") going on record.

You had so many ""the walls are closing in"" moments that turned out to be bupkiss that a huge majority of people now view you as a highly paid rumor mill. And for those of you who think that the impeachment alone is enough to prove Trump is the villan you always made him out to be, let me remind you that you can impeach the President for anything. And I do mean anything. Ask Representative Schiff, he'll tell you. If they wanted to, they could impeach President Biden right now for blinking too many times in a speech. Or for having gray hair. Or for some other absolutely ridiculous reason. The impeachment itself is nothing, the conviction is what seals the deal, and you failed to get one twice over. Were it not for the disaster that was January 6th, I would have full confidence that Trump would have been able to pull off a Grover Cleveland in 2024 (for context, Grover Cleveland is the only President to serve nonconsecutive terms).

Wenn man jetzt nur einen CYP2D6 Inhibitor zu sich nimmt verlangsamt man zwar ordentlich den metabolismus der CYP2D6 mediated ist aber dafür verringert man eben auch ordentlich die Menge an Oxycodon die zu Oxymorphon wird. Dafür vergrößert sich die produzierte Menge an Noroxycodon was mit knallen nicht mehr viel am hut hat.

Kann natürlich gut sein dass der verlangsamungs effekt überwiegt sodass insgesamt ein plus an wirkung rauskommt - aber es hat halt nicht den Vorteil die besseren Metaboliten zu fördern.

Oxy -&gt; 2

Tilidin -&gt; 0,1-0,2

Oxycodon ist also 10-20x Potenter, damit entsprechen 80mg 800-1600mg Tilidin. Passt meiner Erfahrung nach auch gut was die nicht analgetische sondern auch ""missbräuchliche"" potenz betrifft.

Jedenfalls kommt bei Oxycodon auch nochmal seeeeeeeeeeehr auf deinen persönlichen metabolismus an. Da kann das oxy auch schonmal sehr viel mehr oder weniger knallen.

Je nachdem ob du eh schon physisch drauf bist oder nicht auch nochmal die Warnung, falls du's bisher nicht warst wird das wohl so langsam der Punkt sein an dem du dahin kommst.

Und dann nochmal ein kleiner Tipp, der metabolismus von Oxycodon liegt so günstig dass ein CYP3A4 Inhibitor die Pathways die zu für missbräuchliche Zwecke unerwünschten Metaboliten führen so beeinflussen kann dass diese relativ gesehen weniger impact haben. Das verlangsamt den Abbau allgemein etwas und erhöht die menge an metabolisch entstehendem Oxymorphon (was eins der Top opis überhaupt ist - Potenz geht so in richtung 10.)

Due to trauma I had a gut instinct of repulsion against spanking. He didn't push it at all. One day I asked him to show me gently. He'd done this only a little himself with a previous partner. 

We just started really slowly. He read up on safe places to spank and for us atm face slapping is a hard no. 

I dont think you should just 'hit the hell' out of him, no. Gentle at first. Then talk about it after in after care. Then increase after much conversation. 

Two things to remember: pain will often release chemicals like oxycotin and dopamine and the sub, if pain (and sometimes without pain) is involved, will be protected from that pain because of the chemical release. He might tell you you're not hitting him hard enough but you haven't decreased the intensity. It's your responsibility as his Dom to monitor and be in control of that.

The other thing is subfrenzy, if he's just dabbled before and you two are getting seriously started he might want to go hard and  fast and not care about limits. Again, it's your responsibility as his Dom to help him recognise and be aware of this. 

And please, please, don't let him push you past your own hard limits. Make sure to figure those out. The ""he says I'm not a Dom"" concerns me - is he saying this to push you or taunt you?",1

My point was Oxycodone (OxyContin) is a literally different drug than Heroin.

I agree with the guy saying they are both in the Opiate family, but OxyContin is not literally pharmaceutical Heroin - which is what the guy above was trying to say. 

The guy heavily downvoted is actually right. I guess maybe he got downvoted because he was trying to be pedantic but said Oxytocin instead of OxyContin?

Anyway, now I wonder why I took so long typing this out.

OxyContin= Timed release OxyCodone
Heroin= Diamorphine

It's literally two separate drugs.
Codeine is an Opiate.
Morphine is an Opiate.

My team is solstis, elineige, Alfana, Celica, and Velfell. Celica is just a tad better than Morphea (but ehh, you gotta use what you have, am I right). Like the tool tip says, kill melee crystals cuz they buff the ranged crystals with a strong dark counterattack, then kill the ranged crystals, then lastly Yatsude.

I think Chaos (Dark) Rings are a must in this one, otherwise your characters will die passively from the turn-based dark damage in addition to the strength of the dark counterattacks. 

If you got *ignore Shield* equipment then that'll help ya greatly. Lastly your artifacts and accessories. Best to be equipping nothing but your best attack/magic stat items. Nothin defensive (it'll hurt, but do your best haha). As for the level, it only increases your base stats by juuuuust a bit. Not much difference between 5, or even 15, levels. But if you want speed of course, every little stat number counts :) 

Since you're just starting out with Yatsude level 9, for equipment your goal is to fill your slots with front 3 light damage (as best as you can). Neutral or light damage will be fine. Of course, the light will be more beneficial in damage.

I didn’t use gas x, but maybe I should have.The trapped gas from surgery to inflate, irritates the phrenic nerve that goes to the shoulder. That was the big reason for the pain. This lasted 2-3 days. I needed help to get up out of bed to washroom, but after a few days I was in mild discomfort when walking etc but could do myself. I only took one hydro morphone day after surgery and used extra strength Tylenol (few times a day, not exceeding 8 pills in 24hr p), naproxen 2 x day. Oh and a laxative.

Later, a pharmaceutical company manufactured it for over the counter cough suppressants and marketed it as less addictive than morphine to steal sales away from mophine cough syrups.

335,2021-10-19 02:47:22+00:00,"Hi, I am the moderator that locked [the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/hvacadvice/comments/q9p2cu/kerosene_heater_safe_to_use_at_night_while/) that you posted on r/hvacadvice. I am a 20 year veteran of the hvac industry, and, before that, I was a street kid playing in punk rock bands. I also never called you a filthy junkie. I _did_ say enjoy your fucking life out of frustration, and I will own that, but there was no name calling.

I am not a spy, but a moderator of a couple of extremely busy subreddits that, combined, see anywhere between 100 and 250 posts a day. I check _everyone's_ post history who I don't recognize as one of the usual suspects because the subs that I moderate have been subjected to multiple attempts at brigading and other abuses. It's nothing personal - I am just doing my job. 

Tonight, I checked up on you, u/MetroMaker because your attitude, as revealed through your reddit comments, reminds me of my brother - who as a 40 year old has OD'd three times in the last year on fentinyl laced shit because he can't get a doctor to prescribe anything legal for his degenerative back condition. It also reminded me of a lot of people who aren't around anymore.

Before I discuss why I locked your post on r/hvacadvice, I want to clarify a few things.

1) I am a 43 year old ex street kid-squatter punk-hitchhiking-rainbow gathering attending veteran of the 90's. Shit was a lot cheaper and a lot cleaner back then.

2) I have had more than my share of blue skin bouts, both myself and friends and family.


IE  - I am **not** just some jackass reddit mod going around fucking with people. When I was deep in, I was occasionally lucky to find a couch or a squat or warmp. As frequently as I was that lucky I was not, and slept in parked trains, behind dumpsters, and in other people's open garages. I have learned to eat well out of dumpsters and how to live frugally when I have something worth paying for.

Look, I get having to sleep in fucked up places. I get _really liking_ the things that you are doing. However, the fumes from Kerosene are toxic and they can fucking kill your ass with little to no warning. I gave you one really good recommendation to your circumstance (insulation) before I checked the post history. I checked it because it is my ""job"" and that history reminded me a _lot_ of people that I have known so I guess it set me off a little.

When I locked the topic I made a judgement call. While I am not trying to obiwan here, I get the perspective behind being happy to be on drugs quite a bit more than a lot of normal people will. My moderation tasks are hard enough without having to deal with a bunch of pearl clutchers and purse grabbers trying to fix everyone. I am 20+ years clean of hard stuff and I am not going to lie, it was a good move for me. When I realized that somehow it had become OK for me to wake up from the Khole in strange people's houses without any of my stuff I began to understand that perhaps I wasn't having as much fun as I thought that I was. Knocking some chick up and, by default, starting a family made this transition easier for me.

So when I make a comment like _""A key to not living in an uninsulated garage is to not give in to drugs and or alcohol""_ I am making a qualified statement that very fucking few reddit moderators can make. I am addressing not just your specific circumstances, but those of a shitload of dead people who have either OD'd or wish that they had. My brother, to this day, claims that heroin is the best thing that ever happened to him. He is 40+ years old with a trade career and a family, and until recently was over a decade clean. His doctor retired and the new one did not agree with the painkiller prescriptions that my brother had for a completely legitimate medical condition, so my brother was forced to deal with his condition by other means. Unfortunately nothing is clean anymore and he has OD'd three fucking times in the last year. If he does again nobody will likely bat an eye but me.

To address your issue, the easiest and cheapest way to stay warm is to not sleep in a garage. Yes, this is easier when you are sober. Yes, people who like being on drugs really do not want to hear statements like this, but I am not here to be popular. I bet this comment is either downvoted to oblivion or is removed, and that is ok. But u/MetroMaker will see this and understand that I acted in good faith after answering their question as best as I could. 

You all stay warm out there.",1

Sukker og koffein er relativt harmløst. Med heroin, med andre rusmidler, så glir det over i at rusen bestemmer over deg. Det er ingen frihet i å være avhengig av narkotika, tvert i mot. 

Vi har en rekke forbud ikke relatert til narkotika som ""vi"" ser på som positive, som kanskje individer tenker at er et spark i trynet. Per Ove som er sint fordi han ikke får kjøre snøscooter ved hytta si til eksempel. Narkomane er en stor belastning på samfunnet og pårørende. Om forbud får hobby-rusere til å føle at de blir undertrykt, er det litt som Per Ove med snøscooteren.

377,2021-10-17 06:09:27+00:00,"What Purdue did in the film is very much in the gray side of things. I can't exactly say what they did was illegal but it was very deceptive.

Some things did get me. Like how the doctor gave the lowest dose after the mining accident. It seems like one should start off with 20 mg after an accident and then taper off to 10 mg once the injury has stabilized. I also thought using the same exact drug delivery system for MS Cotin would work differently for Oxycotin. I take other drugs that use extended release and can definitely tell when there's a dip in medication levels. When the drug wore off at hour 10 the patient could just take the second dose for the day. I also think an extended release version of oxycodone would be more dependency forming than Percocet because the patient will always have an opioid in the body rather than being able to take a break.

&amp;#x200B;

Dopesick reminded me of a federal case I served jury duty on. It was incredibly interesting. A Palm Beach County senior spinal surgeon, Dr. Johnny Benjamin, decided to sell oxycodone by employing some local teenagers. They would get prescriptions for large quantities of percocet. One pharmacist noticed these large quantities and called the doctor. Eventually it wasn't enough and he started faking percocet by buying pill presses and furanyl-fentanyl (an illegal analog of fentanyl that is much more potent).

At the same time this 30-something woman, Maggie, moves from NJ to Florida and can no longer get her oxycodone prescription. So she buys them off a teenager that works in the same restaurant as her. It's also unbelievable the market for these pills - 10 mg oxycodone is worth $35. So she eventually needs more and tries to buy some. These are the fake pills now. She takes one and dies.

I can't attest for the amount of pain she was in or whether something like an NSAID and physical therapy would work just as well. I do believe however she wouldn't have died if she had just gotten a new prescription. But I can also see a primary doctor doesn't feel like losing his license prescribing controlled substance to a new patient. It's also incredible how lucrative this market is and how a retired doctor would decide it's a great money making proposition. He was sentenced to life at 70 years old.",9

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

396,2021-10-16 14:34:15+00:00,"So this was after my first surgery to repair a broken femur (yknow, that huge ass bone in your thigh... and yes I did break it again and had the exact same surgery a year later). I knock out after being put under anaesthesia and wake up the next day feeling pretty groggy.

Now, after surgery obviously you are meant to feel quite a bit of pain where you were operated on, right? Well as I reached over my side to check my wound, as it was fucking throbbing from pain i realised there was a massive pouch of material hanging off my thigh. It wasn't skin, nor muscle, bc it was completely transparent, but it was bulging full and leaking pretty quickly.

Leaking droplets of about a litre or so of blood.

I see this and call a nurse with a remote thingy thats used to let the nurses know what you want, like food and urine bottles and all that crap. 

I go, ""morning nurse X, is this normal?""

She looks at me for a second, leaves in a rush, then comes back with about 5 other nurses, a doctor, bandages, a stapler and other tools, a khpjillion sheets, a few pillows and a new set of underwear, looking freaked out in the process.

Bear in mind i've just woken up and still feeling shit from anaesthesia, so im just there like: 👁👄👁, but this was when i realised that this was serious. I pulled the duvet covering me off, exposing a sheet and matress soaked thoroughly in blood, some of it already discoloured and staining the floor.

Im still only half-awake, so it doesn't really affect me, but some nurses were screaming the doctor started explaining things to me, i wasn't really paying attention tho.

So almost immediately after this, a few nurses roll me over onto my side and take off the dressing of my huge REOPENED wound (it was like 15-18in long) and blood pours out like a fucking waterfall, splashing over a few nurses (one nurse faints at this point but I'll get onto that later if I have the time). Then the doctor comes, tells me to ""brace myself"" in the most ""sorry buddy, this will probably scar you for life"" tone i've ever heard and starts to MANUALLY RECLOSE THE WOUND using a STAPLER, with no anaesthetics or painkillers to aid me.

This was the WORST pain I have ever felt in my life so far, i can't even describe this to you. It hurt more than the initial break, the medical splint I had after I was transported to hospital and the pain from swelling I had previously. Like I start fucking hollering in pain when she starts and it lasts for a few minutes until she's done. I had about 40 staples put in before it was sealed up again, and by this point i had passed out twice, was now fully awake, had a lost voice and sweating hard from the shrieking i'd just done.

The doctor cleans me up, applies new dressings and bandages to the wound, gives me morphene and leaves me to the nurses for about an hour.

The nurses then change my sheets and pillow, both of which look like a murder has just occurred and give me new clothes. (Btw the nurse that fainted apparently smashed her head hard on the floor and had to be assigned a bed as well, due to possible concussion - she was fine in the end and I sometimes see her when I go back to the hospital for whatever reason)

During this, i pass out again.

When I come around again, im surrounded by my mum, a close friend, the nurse I said good morning to, and the Staple Doctor. Here, she explains everything again.

So basically, in the climax of my actual surgery, the surgeon tried to use Skin glue, paired with dressings to seal the 15-17in wound, which didn't work. What that meant was that my wound reopened sometime afterward when I was asleep but my dressings DIDN'T, more importantly - they just leaked. Overnight, I lost a huge amount of blood due to minor hemophilia (from my mum's side), but some of it was retained inside the dressing, which bulged out to contain all the blood and was covered by my duvet. That's when I woke up and called for the nurse, who saw my sheets, leg and pillows soaked in blood, and my huge ass pouch of blood attached to my thigh. She explained that if the dressing had actually come off in the middle of the night, and i hadn't noticed, which I wouldn't have bc i was asleep and still under the effects of anaesthesia, i would have died of blood loss. Which, to this day, scares the absolute shit outta me. Imagine being saved by 5 sticky pieces of plastic holding your skin and almost a litre of blood inside.

The doctor also placed a little bit of blame on the surgeon as she thought it was stupid to try and use skin glue on a wound that large. She was really nice tho.

TL;DR: I nearly died of blood loss bc the skin glue my surgeon used failed. I was saved by a couple of sheets of plastic (which i later found out was actually a mixture of Carboxymethylcellulose, gelatin and pectin), swelling up and retaining some of my blood.",1

  OpiATES= natural kind that come from poppy plants. (Like heroin morphine codeine)

OpiOIDS= synthetic lab made kind (like oxy opana dilaudid hydrocodone methadone fentanyl analogues) 

Have you ever been dependent on opiates in the past? If you have then all it takes is using a few days in a row and you get withdrawals again. 

(3 consecutive days of using is the minimun that will restart opiate dependency,  but also using 3-4times a week will also dk it too. Just because you take oxy every other day doesnt mean you arent still having oxy in ur system the next day you dont use.  It takes about 15 half lives until you no longer are affected by the drug. So since oxy has a 4 hour half life (4x15=60) hours that dose is affecting ur body. When ur using every other day, that one day inbetween using days is not long enough and still have oxy going thru ur body even tho you dont feel high anymore. This is why you havent gotten much of any wds during the sober day. It takes about 24 hours to start getting much of any wds from oxy. Might as well just use daily if ur gonna use every other day.

Ok. I get where you're going, but that's a pretty slippery slope too.

After heroin went illegal many morphinans came on the market, those were actually the very first research chemicals, it included several acetylated -morphones as well afaik, so there was shit even more euphoric than hydromorphone available for a while. Then after those went illegal illicit heroin started to be manufactured and took over simply because it was there and nobody really looked into the alternatives. Its like ethanol, society still uses ethanol despite being one of the most fucked up gabaergics. When acquiring acetic anhydride started to be problematic heroin was already too mainstream so people sticked to it no matter what.

Its the same with why people manufacture dirty shake-and-bake meth despite it being far easier to manufacture pure methcathinone, its just whats known and nobody really gives a fuck. It  used to be good back in the day, now most meth is shit to the point where mcat would be superior, but nobody goes that way anyway.

&gt;All dead at the hands of the police and these are just a few of the recent famous cases

Yeah and for every one of those names there's a white person who was killed by police under similarly questionable circumstances, that nobody gave a fuck about because their deaths didn't sell a political narrative. Nobody says their names because they were playing the same stupid games and winning the same stupid prizes as the half of the people on that list who were attacking the cops or otherwise engaging in rank stupidity like being hopped up on BOTH meth and fentenyl having a drug overdose, or having their boyfriend shooting at the police while they were serving a criminal warrant on him.

Every one of those incidents was an INDIVIDUAL incident, not a representation of a systematic effort to exterminate black people on the part of the nation's police departments. Get the fuck over yourself.

&gt;Hell just this June Hunter Brittain (before you say anything, is a white kid) was shot and killed for putting a bottle of antifreeze behind his tire during a stop, so his truck wouldnt roll back into the officer's car.

&gt;Police are trigger happy, thats a fact. We struggle to even get officer's to wear body cams which would clear them of any false accusations. we need police reform.

THIS IS PERFECTLY FINE! Lead with THIS argument, instead of the provably false idea that the police only exist to systematically assassinate black people, and you've got about 50 million libertarians in this country of the right who are gonzo about having more friends to participate in that conversation. Hell for that matter most POLICE love the body cams after they are implemented, because then the jury gets to see what a jackals the suspect is when they get pulled over for speeding and start shitting all over the cop like it's their fault, and the jury sees EXACTLY what's happening in the moments leading up to a clean shoot so that the idpol wokescold race baiting Democrat DA can't railroad them into a murder charge when the video clearly shows the gun in the kid's hand the instant before the officer fires after a foot chase.

440,2021-10-14 21:36:38+00:00,"As far as I know Diaphin is only licensed for use in one country. OP and I are from that same country. 

I first tried these pills about a year ago. I learned of these pills when some people from the drug scene were telling me to watch out “it’s the heaviest drug that there is”. I asked them multiple times what’s the drug and they just said Diaphin. After researching I found out they are 200mg Pharmaceutical Diamorphin pills that are indicated for use in the Heroin Substitution/Replacement program. Methadone and Subutex still remain the first resort drugs. 

They are available on the street, but are not easy to acquire. Plus, they are very stigmatized. 

The first time I picked them up, I got 3 x 200mg pills. They came in blisters. They are relatively hard but once you crush them properly they will very easily turn into a powder. 

They are REALLY FUCKING STRONG. I’ve taken all kinds of opiates from street heroin to morphine pills to oxynorms and these pills don’t even compare. I only snort them but people tell me they are easy to shoot up if filtered correctly. 

My first time I snorted a little under 50mg. I wasn’t planning to take that much but someone was stressing me to get rid of the powder so I snorted it. It was in hindsight a very very large dose. Within 10 minutes of taking it I fell into a 3 hour nod. I could not talk, walk or even keep my eyes open. I felt incredible. I tried taking some coke to “wake me up” but it had 0% effect. 

This is better than any street heroin. I was itching so much that I was bleeding and I didn’t even notice. In my opinion this is the best drug that exists.

What’s really remarkable is how much heroin the pills contain. 200mg is a huge amount. I would say that with no tolerance I would recommend maximum 20mg snorted. If you take more than that you will very easily be knocked out for many hours. The most I’ve taken, when I had quite a high tolerance was 200mg over 12 hours mixed with cocaine. You would not believe it, but the cocaine had almost no effect. I am very sensitive to coke, especially if it is pure, but on Diaphin I felt almost nothing. You can snort 200mg of pure cocaine while on this and still be nodding. If anybody is trying these I would say be very careful with the dosage. I imagine if you inject these it is quite possible to die if you take too much. If they contained say 10mg it would be one thing. But with 200mg, one pill is more than enough for many sessions. With no tolerance a single pill (snorted) can last you a week of daily using. They are super potent. I would not advise anyone to combine them with alcohol or benzos. Its a good idea to not take any benzos within a 5-10 hour window of the dia. 

It actually ruined all other drugs for me. The potency is really unlike anything. The duration is very long. I find when I don’t have much tolerance a single 50mg dose can last more than 6 hours, sometimes even into the next day. If you take too much you can get very sick and be vomiting well into the next day. They are very easy to nod from. I can be doing something and then realizing 30 minutes later that I nodded off and was drooling the whole time. The euphoria is very pronounced and motor coordination can be affected even the next day. If you have the chance, they are absolutely worth it. Everyone that I know who uses them, only uses them. Stay safe.",1
441,2021-10-14 20:07:24+00:00,"YTA. Be the parent, lecture her sternly and ground her ass for a while.

Also, don't hide things like pot, alcohol, cigarettes, sex or guns from your kid. Be open about them, explain to them what it is, how it affects a person and how to safely use/be around them. This does 2 things:
1) it educates them on the subject matter, and
2) it takes the mystery out of it, making them far less likely to experiment behind your back with them. But if they do: you'll have the peace of mind that you gave them the information they needed to still stay safe!

So have the safe sex talk, show how condoms are used, talk about birth control and the day after pill. Talk about smoking, alcohol and drug use: pot, cocaine, meth, fentanol, XTC and the effects and dangers of their use. If you want you can even give them some pot, some beer/whiskey (till nearly hung over) and XTC in your house in a controlled environment, so they can experience this in a safe and controlled environment and further have the mystery taken away from them. It pre-empts the peer presure of trying it outside of your control: they'll be able to say: ""It's just meh!""",1

Dont do it more than every 4 months though because it will fuck up your dopamine. 

MDMA can specifically help with PTSD though so it does have clinical usages.

But mostly I just smoke weed now and then. Never been happier and less stressed. Made some other changes in my life it wasn't just the drugs, if you have a stressful life the drugs just going to cover up that stress not deal with it.

Lots of people could be spared from pain, even crazier surgeries could be performed and giving birth became less scary. What people didnt realize is these substances had to be regulated bc they were SO addictive that people ruined their entire lives over it. Same with alcohol, back in the day there was much ignorance about the dangers of alcohol consumption (and i say this as a lover of getting drunk) and alocholics would drag down entire families. Same with heroin. At first, it was advertised as an amazing cure for almost everything, less addictive and more effective than morphene. People drank it like water. It eneded up being a huge mistake. 
Soon people realized these substances could ruin entire societies pretty fast (look at the british fucking over the chinese with opium). 
Soon, they started regulating them heavily so that doctors would be concious about using them, and that the general public would not be able to get their hands on them. It started as a preventive measure. 
Later on, we grew more educated. But there still prevailed a stigma over ""illegal substances"" and soon being addicted to them stoped being a tragedy, but a failure of morality since ""this person probably got themselves alone in trouble bc they were illegal and they knew! Its entirely their fault!!"" 

This mentality proved profitable for politicians and crime gangs. So after aquiring more knowledge about how they work over people, we have allowed them to be illegal since they work as an amazing boogey man for elections and politics.",12

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

497,2021-10-13 06:45:29+00:00,"&gt;É simples: que criassem outro herói! Não precisava ser o superman.

Mas ele **é** outro heroi. O Jon Kent não é o Clark Kent, ele é um personagem legado, assim como o Miles Morales é para o Peter Parker, alguém que vai (ou pode, pq a DC é um multiverso e esse futuro é um entre muitos possíveis) herdar o título de ""Superman"". O Hal Jordan e o John Stuart, o dois, são conhecidos como ""Lanterna Verde"", mas isso não os torna o **mesmo** heroi. Qualquer um que lê as HQs ou assiste os desenhos vê que o Hal e o John são dois personagens diferentes, com experiências diferentes e personalidades diferentes. Além do mais, pq esse fuzuê todo? Quando imaginam um futuro (Injustice) onde o Clark Kent, não outro Superman, o **Clark Kent** se torna um ditador genocida, ninguém reclama. Ninguém diz que destruíram o personagem, pq todo mundo entende que no multiverso tudo é possível e isso não mudou o Clark Kent primário que todos amamos. Agora imaginar que alguém que carrega o manto do Superman no futuro pode ser bissexual, um personagem para todos os efeitos novo (uma folha em branco), é demais? Não entendo essa lógica. 

&gt;E sabe porque não existe ""ex-gay""? Porque pessoas iguais a você demonizam as pessoas que tentam deixar de ter esse comportamento

Cara, sexualidade não é ""comportamento"". Presumindo que vc seja hétero, vc acha que vc conseguiria deixar de gostar de mulher se quisesse? Conseguiria largar esse ""comportamento""?

&gt;QUERES UM EXEMPLO?  
Uma pessoa pode procurar um psicólogo/psiquiatra para ajudá-lo a **resignar a sua sexualidade pra homossexual ou transexual**, porém ela não pode se consultar para voltar a ser heterossexual.  
Essa medida é a tão famigerada ""cura gay"". E se eu não me engano, o psicologo ou o psiquiatra que tenta ajudar um de seus pacientes a deixar de ser homossexual ou transexual, é processado e passível de perder o direito de exercer a medicina.

Aliás, em que mundo vc vive onde pessoas vão no psiquiatra e falam ""*Doutor, eu não gosto mais de ser hétero, eu quero gostar de homem agora. Me ajuda?*"" Vc acha que 

O problema da chamada ""cura gay"", e eu falo isso do ponto de vista de um leigo no assunto, é que o consenso científico parece ser de que ela é ineficaz, com uma minoria que defende sua eficácia, mas que é ""curiosamente"" ligada a grupos religiosos conservadores (igual arqueólogos bíblicos que todo ano dizem ter descoberto a arca de Noé). Um médico que usa métodos não-embasados no consenso científico e que podem até causar danos mentais e físicos ao paciente, perder sua licença não me parece muito diferente de um médico que receita, sei lá tratamento de cristais de quartzo cósmicos pra tratar câncer perder sua licença. Adicionalmente, alguns métodos comumente usados em tratamentos de conversão beiram a tortura. Talvez tenha gente que consiga mudar de sexualidade na força do ódio, mas eu acho muito improvável.

&gt;Agora faça um exercício mental (se é que você consegue ainda): heróis se tornando gays nos quadrinhos (público infanto-juvenil), pessoas não podem se consultar para deixarem de ter comportamentos sodomitas... isso não lhe parece algum tipo de engenharia social? Quem sabe até uma ditadura?  


Que tal **vc** fazer um exercício mental: Existem pessoas negras no mundo, certo? Portanto, pessoas negras existirem na mídia não te parece normal? Seu filho vai ver um negro andando pela rua, pq ele não pode ver um com um anel do poder combatendo o crime numa HQ? Gays saem do armário. Note! Eles **revelam** quem são, eles não **viram** de repente. Quando eu saí aos 20, já aceitava que era gay desde os 16, sabia que era gay desde os 12, a sabia que era diferente desde sempre. Quando seu filho entrar na puberdade lá pelo 6o ano do fundamental e começa a notar cada menina que passa, ele provavelmente vai ter um coleguinha que vai notar cada **menino** que passa, talvez ele até se aceite a saia do armário cedo. Mas alguém passar pela mesma situação numa HQ não pode? Me explica isso?

&gt;Então não me venha chamar de preconceituoso ou de homofóbico quando eu não querer mostrar um Superman gay para o meu filho.

""*Não me venha me chamar de preconceituoso ou racista quando eu decido que meu filho não pode assistir Star Trek pq (pasmem!) tem uma mulher negra e um japonês em posição de comando numa nave espacial*""   
\-- Um bando de americano no Sul durante Jim Crow nos anos 60 --

Vc acha o que seu filho vai virar gay só pq viu o filho do Superman beijar outro garoto? Sério? Cresce, cara. Eu cresci sendo bombardeado com banheira do Gugu, Tiazinha, Bonde das Cachorras, American Pie (adorava, aliás), e tudo que é exemplar de cultura hétero. Não mudou nada. Eu sempre fui e sempre serei gay, e se o seu filho é hétero, ele sempre vai ser.

Agora, vc pode tentar impedir ele de ver que gays existem e funcionam como pessoas normais em todos os setores da sociedade (da mesma forma que pais ""preocupados"" dos anos 60 tentaram impedir seus filhos de ver o único programa na televisão americana onde uma mulher negra não era empregada ou escrava, mas uma oficial competente), é seu direito. Mas isso te torna um preconceituoso homofóbico sim. ""*Ain, eu não odeio gay, só quero que meu filho não saiba que existe, por alguma razão que não é preconceito*"". Eu não entendo homofóbico que não gosta de ser chamado de homofóbico ou racista que não gosta de ser chamado de racista. Já tá no inferno, abraça o capeta.",1

Then got Percocet twice a day for another almost 30 days. I can't believe I didn't get a habit from it as I had a opioid dependence history, but was clean when I got hurt.

It wasnt a racially motivated killing. It was likely neglect by Chauvin as all the evidence of them trying to call an ambulance and get him help was there once they noticed he wasn't being responsive. He died because of a fentenyl overdose which he took right before the police got to his car.

The knee on his neck wasn't on his trachea and therefore shouldn't have affected his breathing as he was still able to talk. It was also a technique taught in the police handbook which he was following.

Benzos are anti-anxiety medications that act on GABA receptors. Opioids are pain medications that act on, well, opioid receptors. Theyre two entirely different classes of drugs. We had a benzo problem in the US a few decades ago when Valium was given to anyone who asked for it, basically. Theyre still common on the streets, but the reality is a large majority of the illicit benzo supply isn't benzos at all, but opioids like fentanyl pressed into the shape of benzo tablets. Alot of that is what's fueling opioid overdoses in the US--where people think they're getting Xanax, oxyxodone, or even heroin, but its actually the vastly more powerful fentanyl or a fentanyl analogue. Im actually a recovering heroin addict, and my last overdose was from some 'heroin' I bought that was mostly fentanyl. Someone didn't cut it right, and a tiny amount nearly killed me. It took 2 doses of narcan to bring me back. 

I often wonder if fewer people would die if we just realized that some people were going to get opioids no matter what, and decided to supply them through regulated sources rather than leaving people to by questionable drugs on the street.",8

That's irrelevant to the original point I made. More Roundup will lead to more sickness, there is no way to refute that statement. It's more a question of how much more sick people get that's unknown.

It's like saying more water will lead to more wetness, and I don't have to throw water on your face to prove water is wet.

&gt;Did you read my link which describes in detail how glyphosate has lower toxicity than the compounds which it replaced?

I read what I could with the little time I have right now. But again it's irrelevant. I'll look more into it later if you like.

&gt;Juries are not scientific researchers. There is a global scientific consensus that glyphosate does not pose a carcinogenic risk:

True but you can't prove a case in court without some expert opinions. So we can fairly deduce a strong case was made that Roundup caused the problem.

&gt;World Health Organization: ""In view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the Meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.""  
&gt;  
&gt;European Food Safety Authority: “Glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and the evidence does not support classification with regard to its carcinogenic potential.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency: “The overall weight of evidence indicates that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a human cancer risk”  
&gt;  
&gt;European Chemical Agency Committee for Risk Assessment: “RAC concluded that the available scientific evidence did not meet the criteria to classify glyphosate as a carcinogen, as a mutagen or as toxic for reproduction.”

Why did so many European countries ban GMO's then?

&gt;...citing experts is not an ""appeal to authority"". I think you're confusing cynicism and skepticism.

Citing experts to support your argument is fine. What's not fine is acting as if an argument is true because an authority said so. Authorities are often wrong, which I clearly demonstrated with my Oxycotin example.

Do you need more examples? How about Tobacco? For decades authorities told us Tobacco was safe, and even healthy.  I'm sure you know how that worked out.",0

I agree with the sentiment though, it would've been better to leave her be perhaps but the chances of her hurting others or hurting herself and dying in a slow, painful way is not ideal. 

My grandmother can't walk, and had I not moved in, she'd have likely fallen down the stairs and killed herself/paralysed herself or worse, burnt the house down (semi detached, the neighbours would've been affected too).  Just my experience as to why you shouldn't just let 80+ year old people wreck themselves, even if its because of alzheimers and they'll pass away *eventually* anyway. There's kinder ways to go about these things, and when it's near the right time, most doctors are sneaky about it too.

&gt;  
&gt;They aren't. Less inputs are used, that's the whole point.

Right, that's why there are 385 million cases of pesticide poisoning every year. &lt;dry laugh&gt;

&gt;• Crops may be dependent on the use of pesticides and herbicides.  
&gt;  
&gt;They aren't.

From an Chicago Tribune article

""Dow Chemical and Monsanto are genetically modifying corn and soybeans so that farmers can soon spray entire fields with chemical mixtures that include herbicides from generations past, wiping out the so-called superweeds without killing the crops.

Their advice to farmers: Don't just replace one chemical with another; add more.""

That doesn't sound like dependency at all! &lt;snicker&gt;

&gt;• The effects of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) on human health are still unknown, and therefore there is a risk in terms of trading off health for profit.  
&gt;  
&gt;They are heavily tested before being approved.

Oxycotin was heavily tested before being approved too. And it killed millions of people. So your comment literally means nothing.  There is clearly an unknown risk, at least until more viable testing is done or better technology is invented.

&gt;• There is a risk of corporate monopoly in the farming sector if GMOs are adopted by a majority of farmers, because only corporations will have access to GMO seeds and no one else will be able to produce crops for themselves or sell their own crops at market.  
&gt;  
&gt;Same with non-GMO as they are patented as well. Also patents expire after 20 years. For example the non-GMO Honeycrisp apple has expired as well as the GMO first gen Roundup Ready soy. Both can be grown without paying their patent holder (U of Minnesota for the apple and Monsanto for RR soy) any money.

Patents expiring doesn't prevent monopolies in any way.  Corporations will still have enormous buying power compared to smaller business. Your comment is like saying I could compete with the Iphone once their patents expire. LOL, come on man, are you naive or shilling?

&gt;• The possible effects of GMOs on human health are not yet well-known so it is not clear whether they can harm people who eat them or workers who handle them.  
&gt;  
&gt;They are heavily tested before being approved.

I already addressed this but will expand on what I already wrote. You say they are heavily tested, and my question is, tested by who? Monsanto, the FDA? Wow, I guess everything is fine then because they never did anything shady before! &lt;sarcasm off&gt;",0

No spoilers here 

&amp;#x200B;

Reading/Contemplating to continue:

5 chapters into [Muv-Luv Alternative](https://vndb.org/v92) at the moment will probably finish within a few days and maybe I will manage to fit one of my other stalled novels within the rest of the time

[Kinkoi](https://vndb.org/v21852) : Really wished I could read Ria's route and the only novel I have currently bought off sale just cos the demo was much better than I expected. Kinda regret putting my favorite 3 characters behind to read after just because I probably would've binged it more. Currently finished Heroina and reading Sylvia's route but I think I don't exactly like them as much as the 3 other girls so here's to hoping I can finish Sylvia's route and see the parts I will probably enjoy more. Other than that it's probably your run of the mill moege from what I've read thus far but with a pretty banger common route.

[Baldr Sky](https://vndb.org/v1306): Finished Dive 1 about 2 weeks ago maybe, unfortunately probably don't exactly have time to read I assume 3 more routes. But the actual combat is pretty fun kinda wish there were more games with that kind of gameplay.

[Symphonic Rain](https://vndb.org/v38): (actually dropped this one quite a while ago) I don't know why but i can't really bring myself to finish more routes. I finished only Fal's route and I kind of like it for having an ending that is kind of left up for interpretation but the game is maybe too good at making the situations uncomfortable and I just can't exactly pick it back up easily so maybe eventually I will decide to continue.

[428 Shibuya Scramble](https://vndb.org/v1299): I kind of enjoy the novel so far (only 2 chapters in) but I guess the fact that its using real people makes it kind of off-putting. I can't really describe it well but I can't really enjoy many shows that aren't animated. I can't put my finger on it quite well but i assume its just because its much easier to disassociate animations from reality so its easier to enjoy the story for what it is. (Just an unfortunate problem with what kind of things I like I guess) but will probably eventually finish this one as well

[Saya no Uta](https://vndb.org/v97): Read a bit (probably like 20 mins) but I can't exactly remember why I stopped. This one is quite highly regarded but I've just never brought myself to finish it even though its probably not that long according to VNDB.

&amp;#x200B;

Finished Recently:

[Chaos;Child](https://vndb.org/v14018): Y'know I kinda put this off for quite a while, I never read Chaos;Head and I read through the first 30 mins probably at the end of 2020 but just pushed it off to 1 side to read other stuff and play some games. But when I got back to this a few weeks ago I binged it all the way in a week. Its probably one of my new favorite novels just for the ending. Also read through the light novel Children's Reverie after and it really does complete the experience. The novel just has such a different feel that most other novels I have read, from the background cgs to the music it really does set the scene perfectly from the tense moments to the heartwarming ones. Definitely recommend to read even without having to read Chaos;Head.

[Muv-Luv](https://vndb.org/v93): I guess I can see where people are coming from given the whole&gt;!Lacrosse arc.!&lt; But I actually really enjoyed the individual routes in Extra more than I expected. The common route was kind of a drag but I really did enjoy the individual character motivations which can be seen also in Unlimited. As for Unlimited I guess it acts as kind of a precursor arc for alternative where the common route is its main strength. I also really enjoyed this part more than I expected. Kind of skipped past some character ends in Unlimited but I assume its going to be more or less the same anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a lot of backlogged novels as well as playing Tales of Berseria along with some games my friends ask me to play so RIP. Hopefully I can at least continue more in the little free time I will have in my 2 years of service.

Oh... well it’s probably because she was such a strong woman that she developed those bunions from all the heroic... Now What??? Seriously??

587,2021-10-09 03:34:53+00:00,"Hey I didn’t end up going camping because it’s going to rain all weekend and I don’t feel like doing that by myself! Wow we are very similar man with my darkest days behind me I hope! I have experienced death many times myself, the first time was 3 years ago I was In a car accident I left dialysis and it was hott out and I got dizzy and blacked out at the wheel and hit someone head on going 45 miles an hour…… I don’t remember much but something in another world saved my life that day I honestly think it was my father that passed a few years before that! At the time I had an adrenaline rush and was trying to crawl out my window at the time I didn’t know my injuries, I woke up 2 weeks later and found out I had broken both my knees my shin my right foot and broke 9 ribs and my sternum my collar bone my right hand and punctured a lung and cracked my head too….. I also broke my lower back and my right hip! They told me I might not walk again…… 3 days later I was walking up and down the halls because there was no way I wouldn’t walk again the hospital I was in was a terrible experience because if it wasn’t for me getting up and out of that bed everyday I wouldn’t of walked out of there they didn’t care if I layed there for the rest of my life! I got out of the hospital in a month and a half! With that many broken bones they told me it was a miracle how fast I healed!! It was a crazy experience! I have healed faster than most! In March of 2019 my blood pressure was out of control and I had a seizure in my bed and my brother happened to walk by and found me I went to the hospital and woke up 2 weeks later and I had amnesia I didn’t know who anyone was or who I was, I kept saying I was abducted my aliens and that I was a copy they sent back to earth…… my mom told me the doctors kept asking if she has mental problems she told them no…. But I was convinced that something other worldly took over my body it still gives me chills to this day! I kept telling them my body is not mine and I want to go back to where I came from….. they asked me where that was and I kept pointing out the window to the sky….. so a couple days late from the drs giving me heavy doses of medicine to knock me out because I was constantly talking about other worldly things, they just thought I was crazy….. a few days after that I woke up one morning to my mom and my ex husband and I said hey mom hey Seth what happened? They told me the whole story and I started remembering bits and pieces of what happened! I have since thought from that point on I was here for a bigger purpose in life, I love talking to people going through what happened to me and my life to know there’s other people out there that I have helped, either getting clean or just making someone’s day! I have other worldly things that happen to me all the time too…… it’s very weird and sometimes I just shrug it off but when I go camping by my self in the woods I have so many ghostly experiences that it’s kinda 2 nd nature to me! I have looked past that veil of death and it’s truly mesmerizing, my first time on deaths door when I was 7 and I have always been a weird kid when it came to death….. I have also died on a surgery table too the hospital over dosed me on fetanyl and had to restart my heart…. And that was when I was in the hospital after my accident! I have also got real into meditation when I was about 13 because I wanted to see the other side of the world, most kids don’t do them kind of things at that age but it interested me so much! I have been on deaths door 3 or 4 times  and I’m still here I guess that’s what gives me my strength everyday to live! My sister I told you about the one that envy’d me when I was young, we became really close as adults and she just shot  and killed herself about 5 months ago….. before she passed she always told me she envied me because I fought everyday of my life to live when she wanted to die! That has stayed with me and even my darkest days I think about her and how she suffered to the point of death….. is that the easy way out I couldn’t tell ya but I know she’s with me now when I need her!!! But to a lighter note my tattoo I got it says love on my right hand with a peace sign at the O! I’m kinda obsessed with the peace sign, cause now when I flick someone off the peace sign is upside down! Which means death in the Viking Alphabet and the peace sign represents life….. you know what runes are that’s what I’m talking about! All my tats mean something! I have peace sign if the shape of a tree…. And my astrological symbol I’m a Virgo…. My favorite quote…. Not all those who wander are lost! I have a oak tree on my entire back! Nautical stars, jack the pumpkin king and a mushroom! I want more but don’t have the money right now lol….. but it’s nice talking to you I have to ask what is your name? I’m kinda interested? It seems weird to talk on here but I feel most people in my life I meet for a reason! I’m a private person when it comes to social media I don’t have anything like that but I have enjoyed talking to you! ❤️✌️hope to hear back from you!!! And PEACE to every one of your moments that pass you by!!",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

We vary on an individual level quite significantly, but as a population we behave predictably. I think there are systems that exist that most people are not informed about and require humans within that system to allow them to participate (stock brokers, real estate agents, doctors). When the people in charge of these systems abuse their power and the ignorance of the outside world it can have catastrophic effects on us all. It's true that every individual played their part but ignoring the warning or simply not caring, but pointing the finger at them allows the real culprits to get away. How many people (the ones who gave shit ratings or continued to sell shit mortgages because it made their wallet fatter) were thrown in jail for drilling the 2008 American housing market into the ground and kickstarting the worst economic environment in almost 100 years? What about the lies the Sackler family spread about Oxycotin and its addictiveness. They pushed that drug so hard because they knew how addictive it was. Yeah the guy in my HS shouldn't have OD'd, but what was the option when the prescription on his Oxy was out and he recovered from his injury. Sure they lost a class action lawsuit, but the family is still walking free and worth Billions, much of it from the same evil shit I just mentioned. The list goes on.

the way the media is describing it, it is much more similar to a ""poison"" than a ""drug"" in common understanding, although of course any compound is a drug and anything is poisonous in sufficient quantities.    


From the media's description, exceptionally few individuals would willingly take this.     


But frankly I trust America's media in terms of ""Foreign thing is Scary and it's coming for you!!!!"" roughly 0.01%.   And I already can see a lot of contradictory claims about both what it does and how it's been used historically.     


Frankly I don't know enough about it and so far I'm not seeing any true sources or studies on it.  Just a lot of rumors and claims that frankly seem like the same ""If you touch a cellphone someone handling fentanol touched you'll die!!"" ridiculous stories the media likes to make.     


If it truly worked the way it's described, I think it would be more than fair to classify it not as a narcotic but instead as a chemical weapon, and normally a concealed one.    That would likely involve some regulation but not making it illegal.

644,2021-10-06 05:37:25+00:00,"There are several antibodies that can be tested for but they shouldn't actually be used to diagnose scleroderma. Scleroderma is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. So you need a collection of them to make the actual diagnosis. A biopsy to affected skin can be used to get you under the scleroderma umbrella. If it's positive it will come back for excess collagen and could even be labeled morphea which is another form of sclerodermas localized form it does not mean you have morphea it's just old naming in testing sadly which causes misdiagnosis.  It does confirm you have a form of scleroderma though. There are quite a few scleroderma antibodies you can test for but most rheumy's don't even know them all unless they specialize. Most specialists wont use them to diagnose but it can give an idea of issues you could face and potential progression. So what you should be looking out for is the scleroderma symptoms like: GERD/acid reflux, GI issues, swallowing difficulties, shortness of breath, PAH, raynauds, and of course so much more which you can find online. Also just because you have an antibody does not mean the scleroderma will even become active. Also some patients have been diagnosis with scleroderma without an antibody.

You can find more information on [sclerderma.org](https://sclerderma.org) and the scleroderma education project. The scleroderma foundation has a youtube channel with all the videos from the conferences. I highly recommend giving the channel a look to learn more.  If you do get the diagnosis or have enough symptoms that you feel you have it having a diagnosis by a scleroderma specialist is recommend as well as treatment they're the experts.  Also some doctors believe there is no genetic link at all others say if it runs in the family it increases your chances but 1%.",1

Are there multiple cases daily of finding users in this state?

I didn't know the smell of it before. It's not as pungent as weed. You wouldn't smell it on someone who has recently smoked but the effects fade fast as well. It's like anything. You find it more when you're actively looking. You wouldn't notice how much its being used in squats, in hostels etc you also wouldn't notice it at night to get themselves asleep. It's only noticed in individuals who try to smoke it and go about their day. I would suggest that's a small percentage of users. 

 
&gt;Also what is your thoughts on how things currently are? Is it just slowly getting worse? Are there any changes you think could help that we don't currently have in place

I've been out of it for a whole now. I will say there does need to be safe injection rooms, less of a stigma with addiction, a surprising amount of people don't realise 1 or 2 different choices and that could be them. I've seen people look at addicts like they are pieces of shit, which hurt to see. These are more often than not damaged people, not bad people, damaged people.

The systemic form has 3 main branches limited systemic scleroderma, diffuse systemic scleroderma, and sine scleroderma. Sine scleroderma is unique in that it doesn't affect the skin. Diffuse and limited differ on how they affect the skin. Now the antibody isn't usually super helpful in diagnosis but it can give an idea of future issues and sometimes possible progression.

I understand this is a lot of information to take in when your nephew may not even have scleroderma but I personally find knowledge to be power.

If it does end up being scleroderma then finding a scleroderma specialist is ideal especially one who does it with kids. I understand that could be very hard to find.

This issue is less about the drug itself and more about how our society is failing. Fentanyl, heroin, oxycodone, oxycotin, dilaudid, none of these things ever told me to crush and snort them or inject them in my arm. The problem is with how society treats mental illness and addiction. And that's just the tip of the ice berg. Every junkie has their own reasons for doing drugs. But, in most cases it because they have nothing else to stop the way they feel and no one to help them figure it out. Its running from problems you have no solution for. It's fear of the unknown. We all do it in some way. We all have a crutch. But the solution is not blaming the means we use for a crutch. It's asking why we needed that crutch to begin with. Its asking how can we fix the issues surrounding addiction to stop the need for addictive substances. I'd be willing to bet most of the people in the video are homeless or about to be, and have more problems than they have solutions for them. These thing change you. They bring you down to your knees. They damage you so fully that you loose all ability to control and maintain your life. Once you are caught in their grasp you loose everything that gave you strength. Its a nightmare. And it's not a simple thing to fix. It takes years to feel like yourself again. And even then there are parts of you that you never recover. It takes strength that you don't think you have yet. And it takes humility. The humility to see your errors and the desire to want to fix them. These people wouldn't be in this situation if they were doing well to begin with. We need to stay focused on the real issues and educate those who don't understand. They'll never stop these drugs from getting out on the street.

A sequência acompanha o jornalista Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), que cria poderes sobre-humanos quando seu corpo se funde com o alienígena Venom. A nova produção se passa um ano depois dos acontecimentos do primeiro filme, lançado em 2018, e encontra Eddie enfrentando dificuldades para se acostumar à vida com o simbionte. Enquanto tenta se restabelecer como jornalista, ele acaba entrevistando o serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), que também vive com um simbionte.

 O novo longa da Sony em associação com a Marvel, dirigido por Andy Serkis, também se saiu melhor que o filme anterior, que havia conseguido US$ 80 milhões no seu primeiro final de semana. Além disso, o lançamento foi o segundo maior de todos os tempos no mês de outubro nos EUA, ficando atrás apenas do campeão “Coringa”, que estreou em 2019 atingindo a marca dos US$ 96,2 milhões.

-----------------

As altas cifras alimentam o otimismo em relação à volta do público aos cinemas. Com as incertezas da pandemia, a Sony havia adiado a estreia de ""Venom: tempo de carnificina"" do fim de setembro para 15 de outubro, mas acabou mudando de estratégia e adiantando o lançamento diante do sucesso de bilheteria de ""[Shang-Chi e a lenda dos dez anéis](https://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/shang-chi-a-lenda-dos-dez-aneis-saiba-tudo-sobre-heroi-do-novo-filme-da-marvel-25180352)"". O primeiro filme da Marvel estrelado por um super-herói de origem asiática arrecadou mundialmente mais de US$ 386 milhões desde que chegou às telonas em 2 de setembro.

Por aqui, o filme da Universal faturou quase R$ 1,2 milhão em seu primeiro dia, de acordo com os números estimados do Filme B Box Office Brasil. Já no Reino Unido e na Irlanda, o título arrecadou US$ 11,4 milhões no sábado, alcançando o maior dia de bilheteria de qualquer filme da série.

 O filme que traz Daniel Craig pela última vez na pele do superagente James Bond só será lançado na América do Norte na semana que vem, mas já figura como o primeiro título de Hollywood da era pandêmica a ultrapassar US$ 100 milhões em um lançamento estrangeiro, sem a China.

Aqui vemos que você definitivamente nunca procurou se informar sobre oque o ciro defende/ataca...  


Se depender do PT, nenhum partido afiliado a dele nunca mais lança candidatura, isso nao é suposição, é fato,  basta olhar os anos anteriores, ele sempre sequestra protagonismos, e fez tudo isso, pra ir lá e roubar pra krl o pais e fazer muita cagada.  


e pelo visto também nao entende a visão de estratégia dele... vou dar um resumo pra vc n falar asneira dnv.  


O brasil ainda tem um grande numero de lava-jatistas, que popularmente é mais conhecido como anti-PT, efetivamente essa gnt ta dividida entre o lado de bolsonaro, ou de lado nenhum, que sao os que compõem parte do que a polarização(esquerda/direita) chama de ""terceira via"". Que sinceramente, é um nome prejudicial, da a entender que ira surgir uma terceira ""imagem"", um terceiro ""Heroi"", ""mito"" ou algo do tipo, para as pessoas seguirem fielmente, igual fazem os petistas com o lula, e os bolsonaristas com bolsonaro.. isso nao é vdd, ninguém na chamada ""terceira via"" espera o surgimento de outro ""culto"", pelo contrario, são pessoas que lutam contra o populismo, que é a causa da polarização no brasil.  


a estratégia do ciro é: Primeiro, ele conta com que bolsonaro nao vá participar da eleição de 22, seja pelo motivo que for, existem boatos em brasilia, isso, varios politicos ja comentaram sobre, de que o acordo feito entre bolsonaro e STF pelo Temer, é de q bolsonaro nao vai concorrer em 22 a presidencia, e com isso os processos no STF contra ele e seus filhos vao ser engavetados.  


outra possibilidade é o impeachment, seja pela camara, ou pelas investigações contra bolsonaro no STF(que levaria ao impeachment por crimes de responsabilidade), ou o TSE ir pra frente na anulação da chapa dele sobre as eleições de 2018.  


Com Bolsonaro fora da jogada, os anti-PT vao procurar alguém, com isso ciro pretende desde já deixar registrado sua luta contra o PT.  


O pessoal da ""terceira via"" já combinam em apoiar aquele que dali mais tiver chances de ganhar do lula, que desde já, as pesquisas apontam o ciro, os numeros de agora, nao consideram doria, mandetta, Datena, Eduardo leite, apoiando o ciro, pq as pessoas nao veem isso acontecendo, e tb n consideram todos aqueles que vao migrar do bolsonaro para esses caras, ja q eles vao apoiar o ciro, migrar para esses caras é também migrar boa parte para o ciro, mesmo q indiretamente.  


Outro fator importante, é aqueles que HOJE votam no lula por medo da reeleição de bolsonaro, sem ele na jogada, também vao migrar para outras lideranças  


A ""Terceira via"", desde ja combina que independente do representante, o dialogo vai existir para atender a necessecidade de todos ali, como já diz Eduardo Leite, algo do tipo: ""nao posso ignorar quem o povo escolhe como representante, por que existem pessoas ali que precisam também ser ouvidas, não posso governar apenas para quem me elegeu"", essa é uma ideia mt presente entre todos esses candidatos, oque reforça q ideia de que quem for eleitor do EL, Doria, Mandetta, Sergio Moro(Que talvez vá fazer parte disso), Amoedo, vai aceitar votar em quem for o ""representante da terceira via""",1

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Disclaimer: ramblings to follow.

 I met ladies who were in jail for the same thing (being involved in injection ODs) and also a lot of shooters who couldn't shoot up alone. My cellie (bunkie) had huge scars and marks from her fucking up while trying. Shooting one another up has some weird connotations when it comes to it being a crime. Sort of like sex crimes, I guess, for lack of a better more concise comparison. Since it's something that's done concentually, often, it can be really hard to tell who is telling the truth and what the circumstances are when certain parties/victims/junkies wind up dead, unconscious, or hospitalized afterwards. 

My dad was left dead in his home after a bad shot with his dope friends. They robbed him and ran. (To be clear, they were just using drugs together, shot some bad dope and my dad said he knew instantly and then he was out.) It's a brutal world. The ambulance revived him with paddles and a shot when they arrived on the scene after my cousin got a bad feeling and went to check on him. It was hard not to fucking hate them for it. My dad though, when he came to, after being in the ICU, he wasn't mad at his junkie friends for leaving him. Told me he would have at least called an ambulance for his friend, but definitely indicated he wouldn't stick around for the police reports to follow the OD. 

In the case of Sean's new gal, I happened to notice the same week her crime happened, some dealers went to jail for heroine deaths in their area for lacing with dangerous levels of fetanyl. Now I have not looked at her case at all, but my investigative brain found it note worthy. 

One girl in our pod caught her charge by selling her bestie half her bag of dope. Didn't shoot her up or anything. The girl took a fatal amount right after. They were both 18. No doubt this kid made mistakes but the sentence she had ahead of her (ten years) seemed intense for her particular circumstance. Always bothered me despite the amount of cases I've seen in the paralegal field.

I hope your sister is able to heal and you as well, as it hurts to see our family go through that trauma. Peace and healing vibes being sent your way, fellow Redditor. :)",5

Its also counter build aldous when he build malefic roar. Because all your other defensive armor became useless.

Twilight is better alternative to wings since they nerf wings dmg reduction. And tank doesnt even use its spell vamp.

Twilight is literally life saver againts mm who use 5 att item.( For tank role especially(

-First its not synergyze with antiq cuirass, if you havent read last patch antiq cuirass only reduce att point when you get hit by skill now while blade armor reflect basic attack so they dont interfere with each other. 

-second its only deal 25% reflect so it doesnt works againts aldous because he is so bulky. Look, blade armor is DEFENSIVE ITEM not offensive item, its main purpose is to REDUCE DMG not to deal dmg . Reflect dmg is bonus.

You need to see from attacker perspective too.

Here example of my last match i use lvl 13 grock vs lvl 15 layla .

My build armor boots , blade armor sky helmet and immo,cursed helmet.

And and her build

Aspd boots, scarlet ,dhs ,berseker furry,malefic and wind talker.

Even though i dont touch her she lose 40% of her hp while i lose only 30%.

If she build raw dmg instead of aspd + malefic she will be dead for sure.

Heck i force beatrix multiple time to base just because reflect dmg when using thamuz,i dont even touch her.

If you increase blade armor reflect dmg how are mm supposed to join meta? Even 20% reflect dmg is too much imo.

Also no item is a must have for every match except boots maybe.

Do you even play tank? Also blade armor is pretty cheap its great item when enemy manage to snowball and you want to drag it to late game.


You could build immo and antiq vs blade armor and it has similiar def value but with half price.",0
