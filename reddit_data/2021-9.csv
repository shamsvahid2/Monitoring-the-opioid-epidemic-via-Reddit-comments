If you truly kicked the addiction, you wouldn‚Äôt be acting like a complete junky defending your drug of choice over something you‚Äôve never even tried, have no idea about the pharmacology of, and is far less likely to lead to addiction. Dph is something most people try out of curiosity and don‚Äôt enjoy‚Äîfentantyl is something that has caused a nation-wide crisis due to its potency and addictive ness. There is no comparison. You clearly have not done any research at all if you believe something used as an OTC sleep and allergen aid is somehow worse than fentanyl.

The fact of the matter whether your agenda aligns with it or not is that, despite being just about the easiest drug to obtain, dph is not a problem drug like benzos are opioids are. You do not see dph addicts wasting away in the streets, spending all their money on dph. You do not see people on dph fighting people in violent blackouts like you do bartards You do not see hundreds of dph hospitalisations a day. You do, however, see thousands of opioid deaths a year. And you do see deaths from mere withdrawal with benzos. So shut up and stop giving people suicidal advice, how ridiculous that you‚Äôre encouraging people to do fucking fentantyl over a drug which they will most likely try once and not even enjoy.

~

My grandfather's funeral was one of the most psychologically damaging events of my entire life. Not the funeral itself, I was super looking forward to seeing everyone.

That was the weekend I found out my brother is/was/is addicted to fentanyl. My dad waited to tell me until I was about to leave town to travel there. And I spent the whole 4 hour drive crying.

Then my Dad basically refused to put my brother in a hospital, said he's fine and he has drugs to come off it he obtained somehow.

He accused me of over reacting when I pointed out that his sister died of am OD which includes fentenyl.

He offered to get me a separate room since we were going to share, and I said absolutely not, since someone needed to watch him.

So I spent the majority of the weekend stuck in a hotel room worried by brother was going to kill himself. Giving out medication I wasn't comfortable with and him begging me to give him my add medication. (Fuck that)

The real bitch of it was that his mother (we have different mom's) was in town for the funeral too, and she refused to watch him instead, because she was too mad at him. (Gee I wonder how he ended up an addict).

I at least was able to feel ok enough to leave him to attend the actual funeral and wake. But of course I had to miss additional visiting that night.

So yeah, I have some funeral PTSD now. 

BUT there is silver linings. This trip was what finally enabled me to find a therapist after years without.

I also went no contact with my dad for 5 months. And since have firmly established healthy boundaries for the first time in my life. 

My brother is still using other substances I believe, but he is off fentanyl as far as I know. We don't really talk. I'm not mad at him and I don't hate him, I just feel sorry for him. As Kevin smith says, he's got a nickel brain and a  million dollar heart.",2

14,2021-09-30 10:51:38+00:00,"Floyd wasn't murdered, he overdosed on drugs. When the police arrived, he was selling drugs to someone and he panicked, swallowing said drugs, hoping the police wouldn't find out. Those drugs, including Fentonyl (sp?) led to him having complications since he had an existing heart condition. He was already suspected of being potentially dangerous, and the officers were taking precautions with him until they were certain he wasn't about to do something that would get them harmed. If you try and claim that he wouldn't have died had the police not been there, you're only technically correct in that he wouldn't have swallowed the drugs that killed him. However, trying to pin this on the police officers is wrong because they were doing their job of trying to prevent the illegal distribution of narcotics, which is their job.

Then I had a bad reaction to the morphine for two straight days :) I was honestly and sincerely convinced I was going to die in that hospital bed. Then they found out it was the morphine, put me off it, and I went home two days later. That's one day less than usual, and I did it while unable to move for the first two.

The following weeks/months were quite painful, as I quit the Oxycodon way before I had to.

The most pain I felt was probably when I sneezed for the first time after the surgery. I did that once, and couldn't do it again for months after because I subconsciously stopped myself from doing it.

They were keeping the baby minimum 5 days- so if their ONLY reason to rush me off iv meds was to send me home - but I wasn't being discharged .... Why the fucking rush?!

Reptile brain is a strategy, not an argument. So moving on.

Immateriality is suspect. The defense was spending their entire time painting him as a drug abusing burnout fentonyl junky. Having the jury not view him as not just a guy who did drugs, but as a living breathing human being, is obviously material. 

Obviously not a golden rule violation.

Didn't realize I was dealing with a paralegal. Glad you looked it up. Now can you work in a few things? Such as ""What is Minnesota State Court and is it different from Federal Court?"" Also try, ""Did his attorney object to the 'spark of life' evidence and preserve it for appeal?""

&gt;If I had the misfortune of being a criminal appellate lawyer, I would jump at this. The government putting up the victim's mom to sob on the stand talking about how good his pancakes were obviously doesn't belong in a criminal trial. 

I mean, I guess criminals everywhere are lucky you're not there to misunderstand their rights for them.

63,2021-09-28 04:53:32+00:00,"There‚Äôs a big difference between addiction and physical dependence. You get some of the worst withdrawals coming off of antidepressants that are comparable to mild opiate WD, and it take some people multiple tries to come off, but antidepressants are considered safe and non addictive. 

This is because it has no recreational potential and addiction requires ‚Äúrecreational euphoria‚Äù because it‚Äôs based on more than just physical, it‚Äôs psychological, like the cravings etc. and that is directly related to the amount of euphoria experienced. That‚Äôs why herion is more addictive than anything else cause it‚Äôs so euphoric. Then theres the stuff I am on, tramadol. It‚Äôs half antidepressant and it‚Äôs a shit opioid, like mild but not enough pain relief and no high. It‚Äôs classified a schedule IV rather than the dangerous schedule II almost every other opioids are put in. That‚Äôs why I have been on it for almost 2 years straight.

Now within the pharma opioids available in the US, morphine is said to be the most euphoric, probably followed by the oxy and hydro morphone.  And then the commonly used oxy and hydrocodone(Percocet and Vicodin). The though behind is that if it‚Äôs not so strong then you could give it to them for longer, and pharma companies are saying that 2 or 1 month is fine they won‚Äôt get addicted. And the amount most people were getting was more or equal to what i got when I had 7 broken bones, I got 2 months of percs and Vicodin then cut off despite the pain still being there but I just stopped. And wasn‚Äôt addicted and waited like another few weeks till I could see a pain doctor. Tho problem is they don‚Äôt know exactly how long is safe from just simple chemistry, and we also prioritized treating pain, which is a good thing, but that ended recently. There was a good clip on greys anatomy from before 2010 where the attending said that ‚Äúwith pain management it was better to be on the side of caution and give the medicine (given in the hospital not a script) even if you think they are faking‚Äù now you can break your arm and the won‚Äôt even give you any pain meds half the time.",1

At my last appointment, my doctor told me that, but offered no explanation of the evidence.  She said that my pain would get worse in three weeks, and I was like, well I‚Äôve been on Oxycodon for three months now and my pain hasn‚Äôt gotten worse.

84,2021-09-27 13:42:31+00:00,"Then we are just confusing terms. Aas I said above if you have 100% pure heroin theres no need to refine it further. What I am speaking of is akin to cocaine paste, a crude extract of diactylmorphine. I am not referring to aa fully refined ""freebase"" of diactyl, I'm referring to what most would call ""heroin #3"". Black tar being a sort of glorified heroin base, a crude extract of an even more crude extract.
 So now that we have the terms straight [1.crude heroin made from morphine made from opium, what i call heroin base here, used as a step prior to refined heroin either black tar, gunpowder, or #4/China white, excluding all the fake fentanyl heavy shit they sell as #4/China white and 2.heroin freebase (as opposed to the hci salt) ready for smoking] i will proceed. Most heroin base/aka ""heroin #3"" is upwards of 50 or 60 or even 70% diacytyl morphine depending on your methods, and both tar and the more refined ""#4"" are made from this albeit with different steps and chemicals. Even if the base (lets just call it ""crude diactyl extract"" for now) was only 30% purity, refining it to 70% is not really impossible by any means. 

Tar began as a sort of quicker cheaper dirtier version of ""real heroin"" but has come to be quite the competitor to so called #4 as the demand for h has grown post afghan war and as the cartels have become more professional and better funded.

These days the lines are being blurred especially since fentanyl became a staple cut/lace. I've seen #4 that was cut down to about 50% purity, I've seen #4 that was 50% or more fentanyl, and I have seen tar that rivals the low end of actual somewhat pure heroin (""real"" #4). If I was able to turn 25 grams into 12 or 13 of nearly pure h that suggests that thee purity (at least the average of what I was geting) is at least 50% purity. And again I have been more successful since then, pulling nearly 16 at my peak, keeping in mind that I am not a chemist and tend to struggle with following detailed directions. I have known others who have pulled 70%+ pure from ""crude diacytyl extract"" and have myself pulled tar from base that was nearly as strong as even the strongest dark web #4 I've ever had.

I'm not even sure where your disagreement is besides terminology. Are you stating that black tar can't reach 70% purity? Or just saying that most black tar is closer to 30%? I can jive with the latter, but the former just isn't true. I'd like to see literally anything backing that up. The link I sent demonstrated rhe average u.s. purity percentage as being in the high 60s. 

It may be true that the majority of tar across the u.s. is low purity, but from anecdotal info, my own experiences, and the handful of time we have measured purity in a semi official manner I have no reason to believe that tar can't by 70% fairly easily. And although nation/world wide it may be true that most tar is trash its probably trash mostly due to cutting than it is an inherent design flaw.

All I can say is in my specific region, the only place I feel I have authority to speak on (having pushed primarily tar here for twenty years on and off), black tar and other similar forms of central and South American h seems to hover around 70% purity. Its what us out here would call ""good"". Maybe I've just been spoiled but in my world that's whats always been available. 

And in case you missed that we were shipping dime bags of our shit and having it cut ten fold and charged up five bucks a bag by those in NC with zero complaints. Maybe its just that most of the world has shitty stepped on dope and that black tar has caught up in many regards to other more lauded and talked about forms of pure (""pure"", although nothing is really pure on the streets) dope as tbe years have gone on. I can accept that. I'm not entirely clear on what your disagreement is, but if its that ""most tar in this region is NOT average 60 or 70%"" then i can't accept that. It wouldn't make sense based on what I've seen and experienced first hand.",1

Unfortunately these new policies did make it harder to run a pill mill. This is where fentanyl comes in. The high price point for oxy was in response to less supply . But anyone addicted to opiates doesn't just end if your phony script does. The cartels started pressing counterweight pills male w fentanyl filler and sometimes little amphetamine. They are then injected into the supply stream as oxy and our priced accordingly at least one dollar per MG. It costs about 3 cents to press a fenanyl oxy fake. Now we've cut out the entire incontinence of dr and shopping. One big difference between fentanyl and other opiates is tgat fentanyl is 100 percent synthetic only chemical precursors  no organic material. Opium oxy heroin morphine they all start w an amount or form of poppy residue. Fentanyl only requires knowledge of the chemical synthesis. The pressed pills are so deadly because they are mixed in powder form for the press which is not an equal distribution forms ""hit spots"" pills with deadly4 MG or more of fentanyl. The only way to properly dilute it is by dissolving the fent and cutting agent volumetrixally in water and then cooked off. This is the difference of today's crisis- completely accidentally overdose of casual users. You can overdose on any opiate but you really have to push the envelope by mixing with benzoyl injecting etc. These new deaths are killing kids who might have a one or two pill a day habit.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

1. [FAKE EPIC Pharm E8](https://imgur.com/3NAVLfm) comparison (fake left/Real Right) 

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

I feel bad for them. During Christmas time, I give out backpacks with necessities: food, medkits, hygiene stuff, clothes, blankets, and because it's Christmas, little liquor bottles.

And what that did, was have folks who were doctor shopping for pills, which is illegal, but getting pharmaceutical drugs nonetheless from a pharmacy, getting away from the paper prescriptions, to that of a data base.

What that did, was shut off the pipeline of doctor shopping, and forcing them onto street drugs like Heroin and Fetanyl. The result, catastrophic, causing mass crime, mental illness  and homelessness.

222,2021-09-23 01:50:46+00:00,"Those are exactly what jumped out at me too. If memory serves, Cherlyn Cadle claims he told her in person that he gave Shanann Oxys some time earlier, in an attempt to induce a miscarriage, and to have also given her Oxys on the night of the murder, in an attempt to induce a miscarriage. The claim about Oxys on the night of, we can substantiate as coming from him because it's in letters he wrote. The one about months earlier, there's not a lot of proof other than that Cadle says he said it, and to put it charitably I am not certain I trust much that she says without proof. She's apparently inserted made-up details in other things Chris has said to her. Who knows.

The only place I see mention of it in the discovery doc is that, at some point (and the date he did this is not known, because he deleted this search from his history) Chris googled ""80mg of oxycodon will"" - will what? No idea. I suspect autocomplete came up with the rest of it for him, but since his autocomplete would have been unique to him and his browsing habits, there's not really a way to check.

I get the impression that *when* he googled that could be important. Since he deleted that search and not others, I have to figure he was worried about anyone seeing he searched for it, which narrows it down to something to do with the affair, or something to do with the deaths, or trying to induce a miscarriage at some point before the deaths (but, again, grain of salt on that one).

And his weird changing history with the kids dying - what he's doing, and the way his story is changing - it's so specific it has to mean something. I think if the guy were just trying to sow confusion for some reason, it wouldn't look like this. I'm willing to entertain a whole wide world of possibilities but I think it's astronomically unlikely that he murdered each child and then murdered them again after realizing they'd been insufficiently murdered the first time. Especially because he still claims the inciting incident was Shanann telling him he'd never see his kids again - but in his newer tellings of the story, these were kids he believed he'd already murdered, unbeknownst to her. What hole is he trying to patch?

Next one's either halfway done or a third done, give or take? Shouldn't be a long time.

Condolences on the kids being at home, that sounds rough. I mean, condolences probably isn't the word I want here because I have no doubt they're fantastic kids but I'm led to understand it's nice when they can go and be fantastic somewhere else for a little while. I shall endeavor to make the next entry worth the wait.",2

&gt; Insulin prices in the United States are skyrocketing. In addition to several challenges **common to high-priced prescription drugs**, **insulin faces several unique legal, regulatory,** and practical challenges to increasing access and affordability. Despite the fact that insulin was developed almost 100 years ago, the insulin market is dominated by only three companies and there continue to be no biosimilar competitors in the United States. Unlike many high-priced prescription drugs, **insulin has been insulated from competition for years**. This article examines the barriers to competition in the insulin market, considering the challenges surrounding **regulatory approval,** interchangeability, trade secrets, and anticompetitive behavior. Further, this article discusses the potential and limitations of various legislative proposals to address access to insulin. In doing so, this article attempts to explain why there is such limited competition in the insulin market and identifies issues specific to the insulin market for lawmakers to consider in developing proposals to address access to affordable insulin in the United States.

The scleroderma foundation also has a YouTube channel I highly recommend checking it out they have videos from all the scleroderma conferences where the top experts in th4 field speak. I recommend looking at the localized scleroderma video from 2018 it talks about all forms of scleroderma not jsut localized so its worth giving it a look. It talks about diagnosis which should always be done by symptoms. A skin biopsy can tell you you have scleroderma it cannot distinguish your subtype but may day morphea it should say excess collagen again outdated information. All they can see from it is excess collagen pointing to scleroderma. There are blood tests but again most doctors don't know all the antibodies to test for and some with scleroderma aren't showing antibodies this probably just means we're missing an antibody in the research that we aren't looking for yet. 

My recommend would be yo read up on the two websites I mentioned and checkout the YouTube channel. If you still think you have it you can get a skin biopsy on the tight skin and find a scleroderma specialist to diagnosis you they can be done on scleroderma.org I'd you're in the states.",3

They‚Äôre both antibiotics and your resistance to penicillin may factor in but not like people think. Same with heroin or oxy, fentanyl, or morphene.

Ime it‚Äôs more about individual make up. I‚Äôm just a small ass girl who can build a tolerance quick, hence why it fucked me up for the first few weeks.

She will be sent to their rehab and hopefully prison is what it takes to get her back on the wagon.

Long story short, he planned this murder for weeks. He tried to murder his babies by smothering them in bed with a pillow the night before he killed his wife. Much to his surprise, his girls still woke up the next day, and he mentions that this made him angry.

Also, he fed his pregnant wife oxycotin to try and induce an abortion. His kids saw him dragging his wife's dead body to his truck. They said mommy needed help so he had them all get in the truck with him under the pretense of getting her medical help.

Apparently he killed the younger one first by dumping her in the oil, but the elder daughter at this point figured out what was going on and began to fight back. However, she was too small, and was never going to win that struggle. She was also smothered and dropped into the oil.

298,2021-09-19 14:13:14+00:00,"Some clarifications: the level of sedation anesthesiologists use during colonoscopies with just heavy amounts of propofol counts as general anesthesia because they can reach levels of sedation where you do not respond to any surgical stimulus (the definition of GA). That does not mean you have to be intubated unless there are other reasons you need to be intubated (namely high risk of aspiration, anticipate difficulties ventilating due to high BMI, OSA, etc). This is safe to do because we constantly are monitoring breathing with end-tidal CO2 through a mask or nasal cannula and can support breathing if we need to. This is the reason why anesthesiologists and not conscious sedation nurses/GI doctors can give propofol.

Other than that, we do not normally use fentany/versed with propofol. It‚Äôs usually either fentanyl/versed OR propofol and the reason being is that it is more likely you will stop breathing on your own when you mix all these drugs together. (It‚Äôs common to add just fentanyl if doing on upper endoscopy). Every place probably practices a different way so don‚Äôt quote me on that.

The 400 mg used needs a little more context to determine if it was a large or low dose: namely how long the procedure was and what your kg weight is. Either way, it gives context for the future for anesthesiologists to go off of.",2

312,2021-09-19 04:51:58+00:00,"Sorry for your situation but I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks I wish I would've stocked up while I could. Had I known everything would get like this when it comes to benzo's and opiates and RC benzo's, I wish I would've stocked up on $.33 to $.50 benzo's that I used to be able to get shipped from Serbia or Montenegro AND stocked up on opiates (1600mcg Actiq's, $50 OG OC 80's, ketamine and nubain multi dose vials, even the $6-7 10mg hydrocodone pills) and $1 benzo's (1mg xanax blue footballs, .25 triazolam, 30mg temazepam, 1mg rohypnol, 2mg rivotril/clonazepam, 2mg ativan for absolute emergencies, and 10mg blue valium in blister packs) and $2-3 real xanax bars still in the sealed glass bottles I used to get from Tijuana/San Diego and the RC benzo's (clonazolam, flubromazolam, even diclazepam and eitzolam) I was just getting a few weeks ago (and used to get from AC and another site that doesn't exist anymore). I also regret not going to Miami during the beginning and/or height of the Miami oxy//pain pill scene. 

If I had a time machine, I'd go back to the early 00's when you could fill out a form online then receive 90 2mg xanax or 2mg klonopin in a legit script bottle from a legit doctor and legit pharmacy for anywhere from $69-99 (in the beginning) to $180 towards the end. Even just getting 90 bars once a month would be great for $1-2 each. If I could see the future, I would've taken some of them but tried my hardest to save as many as possible but nobody imagined the day where 90% of the bars you run across are pressed and not from a pharmacy.

I'd also use the time machine to go back to around 2000-2008ish to go to Miami to hit up as many pain doctors per day as possible. I'd try to hit at least 2-5 per day everyday for 5 days a week for 4 weeks a month. There were enough doctors and pharmacies where you could keep a journal of which pharmacy you used for each doctor (or use their in-house pharmacies that they used to have in almost every pain clinic) and when your return visit with each doctor is/was and you could get at least (hitting 2 per day) anywhere from 120-240 OG OC 80's, 180-720 roxies a day, 120-240 bars a day, 180-240 xanaflex or whatever your favorite muscle relaxer is/was, I'd also try to buy as many as possible off the streets for $4-8 each then ship them back home for $15 each to keep me going and allow me to pay homeless people money to go to the pain clinics with me in exchange for their meds. I would've done more for homelessness than alot of charities by paying them a fair amount when I calculated how much I could make off their scripts.

I'd also try to get different shit like 100-200mg MScontins (my favorite opioid pill that'll still get me high by just taking one and a half (300mg's) orally), oxymorphone, dilaudid, fent patches, fent suckers (Actiq or Fentora), 40mg methadone wafers (my other favorite since I could eat 3-4 of them and not have to take anything else for 24-36 hrs) until they were discontinued, 10mg methadone once u couldn't get the 40's anymore, even lortabs/hydrocodone if the Dr. gave me enough, any kinda sublingual fentanyl products that were available back then like maybe subsys or one of those sprays or strips, even bottles of ""lean"" aka codeine/promethazine, etc... 

Like I mentioned above, I'd try my hardest to go to a methadone clinic to get at least 100-150mg's per day so I wouldn't have to touch any of my personal opioids. I'd try to sit on ALL of them for 5-15 yrs so they'd all double to triple in price, if not more like roxies going for $30 now when I remember buying folks' whole scripts for $4 each, or OG 80mg OC's going for at least $80 now when I remember getting them for $40 MAX at one point. I'd have to do a 160mg oxy + 16-24mg hydromorphone + 10mg's oxymorphone shot once or twice a week but I'd try to keep it to twice a week so I could sit on them until now. 

There's probably not a single stock (gamestop during the robin hood ordeal, tesla before anybody knew who Elon Musk was, Google before anybody heard of it, etc..) that would make u as much money or go up in price the way that most of these opioids have since the mid 2000's. Hell, I'd like to go back to the late 90's where you could definitely get the 160mg OC's and 40mg methadone wafers. Just those 2 alone could make u alot of money and last u a long time. 

Then, when it comes to RC benzo's, I'd borrow as much money as possible and order a kilo of clonazolam powder, kilo of flubromazolam powder, a kilo of flualprazolam, kilo or just 1000's of etizolam pills, 100's of grams of the lesser known ones like phenazepam, diclazepam, bromazolam, fluclotizolam, flunitrazolam, flubromazepam, nitrazolam, pyrazolam, estazolam, adinazolam, etc.. I'd also buy 87 bottles of clonazolam solution, 87 bottles of flualprazolam solution, 87 bottles of bromazolam, 87 bottles of flubromazolam and 87 bottles of diclazepam. I know 87 is a weird number but some of you will know what place I'm talking about. Hell, I might get 174 bottles of flubromazolam and 174 bottles of flualprazolam and not worry about the other ones instead. 

When it comes to Serbian benzo's, I'd buy 1000's of ALL of their $.33 to $.50 benzo's including the following that you can't get alot of in the US: bromazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam/roofies, lormetazepam, nimetazepam, MANY MANY midazolam pills, apaurine AKA diazepam, rivotril AKA clonazepam, xanax footballs and bars and extended release 3mg xanax, halcion, temazepam, nordiazepam, lorazepam for emergencies when I can't get anything else, flurazepam, etc... I know there are others that I can't think of because I've only seen them when they came from Serbia still in blister packs. 

This is about opiates and benzo's but I'd also stock up on anabolic steroids for super cheap where I could get 50ml bottles of testosterone for $100 when alot of folks charge that much for 10ml's of test. They also had 50ml bottles of nandrolone/deca-durabolin which were dirt cheap from my Tijuana/San Diego site. I'd also stock up on ketamine and nubain multi dose bottles for $50 each. I could run my own (illegal) methadone clinic, low-testosterone/men's health clinic, and ketamine therapy clinic if I could go back in time and stock up on testosterone, ketamine and methadone. 

I'd also try to find a good xanax pill press to make blue footballs or maybe bars but I'd want folks to know that the bars are fake. I could put .5mg of flualprazolam in the blue footballs and 1mg of flualp in the bars and folks would never know. Hell, they would prefer them to real bars in my opinion. I'd prefer 1mg of clonazolam or flualprazolam or flubromazolam over a real bar any day of the week.",1

333,2021-09-18 02:45:58+00:00,"Ok so Im by no means defending Sara To say that she deliberately injected the person so she could make him pass out to rob him is an unfair assumption. I'm sure you have no idea about heroin use, but you can take the same amount of heroin 10 different times and get 10 different results. The reason alot of addicts OD is because the strength of Heroin varies so much from 1 batch the the next (then add in alot of heroin is now laced with Fentanyal causing the strength to skyrocket) So she might have given the guy an amount she or he thought he could handle and that one shot caused a deadly reaction within his body.
    Unfortunately Sara's story is a VERY common occurrence in the addiction world. Many people dont get charged, it just depends on what state you're  in during the occurrence AND if the deceased addict has someone pushing for a conviction.

An opioid is any chemical that binds to opioid receptors. 

An opiate is a alkaloid naturally found in the poppy plant. 

A semisynthetic opiate is a chemical that was produced by using natural (the poppy plant) starting material and undergoes some a process called a semisynthesis.

351,2021-09-17 12:31:23+00:00,"Me and my context fucked it up again. TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm backpacking in Latin-America after college. I hadn't ever done coke before going, I was just into weed &amp; occasional psychedelics, but within the first week I tried coke and can't say I disliked it.

By the time I got to Ecuador I was four months in and partying pretty hard. Mostly alcohol, but once you're paying $8 a gram for coke, you tend to let yourself go..

Me and two backpacking buddies arrived to this town that was known for it's drug-scene. Like we got of the bus at 9 in the morning or something and this dude was trying to sell us coke. ""No thanks mate, it's a bit early.."" *""Amphetamina? Heroina?""* ""Shit mate, it's a bit early for blow, I'm all good on the heroin-front.""

That first night we did blow and walked around town all night, smashing nightshop beers and street stand cocktails. Two days later was my last night in this town and we wanted to have a proper party. The club was overpriced, but lets do it. And my mate was like, if we gonna do this, we better get some pills, which he found in no-time.

We take the pills and go for a walk on the beach before going to the club. Like 20 minutes in I start to feel it, but it doesn't feel like MDMA at all. Somehow my mind goes straight to 2C-B. So if this is going to be trippy, it better be good. I take the second pill and we go to the club. 

I'm bumming a bit as I was hoping to get that energized and loving everyone MDMA-feeling. The party is also a massive sausage-fest and I'm getting a bit tired, as if I want to chill rather than party. My mate is feeling the same and he's like, ""fuck this, I'm fixing this with some blow."" Five minutes later he's back and tells us to come to the bathroom.

We stand in line behind each other, he goes first, makes 3 lines on his phone and leaves the phone on the toilet. Good strategy, but a bit of a hassle. So next time my mate is like, ""I've solved all of our problems!""

He ushers us into a bathroom stall, takes a straw and puts in the baggie, takes a little whiff and boom, done. Other mate does the same. We're three guys giggling in a tiny bathroom stall and security comes and knocks on the door, telling us to get the fuck out. So I quickly snort my stuff, my mate puts the baggie away, flushes for some reason and we exit. 

I'm between the bathroom and the dancing area when I realize I took too much. There's not enough air coming into my lungs. I'm too hot. I turn around in the hallway and it leads outside to a little terrace. I take my t-shirt off and start breathing, trying to calm myself down. I'm just so so fucking hot. I wish I could take my skin off. 

I'm not sure how long I stood there, but suddenly my friends came looking for me. By that time I was better already, but it's still one of my scariest drug experiences.

**TL;DR:** Doing coke at a club was a hassle. Friend decided to just put a straw in the baggie. Did too much. Spent about fifteen minutes overheating and out of breath outside.",22

359,2021-09-17 04:34:12+00:00,"My grandmother died in January 2017 basically from COPD. I lived with and cared for her for years before she passed, and every single day I spent with her during those years was an absolute struggle for her. Her oxygen percentage was never above 90% the entire time, and would drop to less than 80% walking from her bedroom to the kitchen a mere 60ft away. 

What ultimately killed her was that she had gotten pneumonia in one lung (which she typically got at least a handful of times a year anyway), and at the same time her other lung collapsed basically forcing her to try to breath on maybe a 1/3rd of a lung total. 

All said and done, the Pulmonary surgeon basically just said, ‚Äúthe best thing we can do for her is relieve her pain and give her a sedative to keep her relaxed.‚Äù 

So, they morphined her up, took her off supplemental oxygen, off fluids, and sedated her to the point of near-sleep. From the time they got that all done, and had her on a continuous line of morphine and a sedative she lasted maybe a day. They *may* have given her enough morphine to million-dollar-baby her, but either way the COPD on it‚Äôs own would‚Äôve been a lot less merciful than the morphine. 

So, yeah, *highly* do *not* recommend adding watching someone die slowly by suffocation from COPD for about a decade or so to your bucket list.

365,2021-09-16 19:56:22+00:00,"&gt; The response to covid has been extremely poor and yet none of the people in charge have faced any consequences

Right, but that isn't unique to government/business actions wrt covid. That's just a staple of the American system and you could say that about nearly *everything*. The Katrina response, big tobacco, oil companies responsibility w/ climate change, Iraq/Afghanistan wars, foreign interventions generally, American companies selling arms to dictators/warlords, the Sackler family and oxycotin, etc. The list is endless. 

&gt;On top of that, I am at extremely low risk of being killed by covid, according to the John Hopkins risk calculator I have a 0.0003% chance of dying. If I get the vaccine now I am teaching a deranged government that it can get what it wants, no matter how dumb that is, if they just act draconian enough.

and on the small scale (e.g. &lt;5% of population) that isn't a problem. But when you have **significant numbers of ppl** that do not get the vaccine that then leads to problems with the healthcare system that begins to be a major problem. And, yes, there are more reasons than solely covid that American healthcare system has problems but, again for American specific reasons, these overall systemic problems are not likely to be solved. So thus we have a vaccine mandate. 

I'm not here to be the defender of all the parts of the American response to covid but I do think that calling the mandate a 'mass coerced human experiment' is hyperbolic. I'm certainly sympathetic to the arguments that big pharma has a mass of problems, etc., but ultimately the vaccine works and is safe. I'm not sympathetic to most anti-vaxxers (maybe 60-80% of them) that 10 months ago would have said/believed the mRNA vaccines changed your DNA. IMO, that's what most hesitancy comes from, just a complete lack of any scientific knowledge about very basic how-it-works kind of stuff (no, I'm not saying you're in this group).",8

Morphine vs codeine is codeine has a 3-methy substitution.

Same with hydromorph vs hydrocodone.

All of the 3-methyl substituted morpian opioids have higher oral bioavailability and all the (excluding morphine) non methylated ones have a higher nasal bioavailability.

In many cases they were not even treating patients, instead just [giving people morhphine](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-quebec-nursing-home-often-gave-morphine-rather-than-treat-covid-19/).  In Ontario, many died from neglect, and needed only a [glass of water](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-military-report-documents-deplorable-conditions-at-two/) to have survived.   

Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott announced measures to transfer patients waiting for a long-term care bed to any nursing home without their consent in an effort to free up space, wrongly anticipating overcrowding at hospitals that never happened.  [They sent sick people into nursing homes on purpose](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/covid-19-ontario-reports-3480-new-cases-outbreak-reported-at-a-toronto-mail-centre).

It is interesting to note that all the worst affected places do currently have conservative governments in place.   Many of the problems were the result of years of neglect of the health care systems in those provinces, spanning right and left governments.

387,2021-09-15 19:10:25+00:00,"This! As someone who works LTC I‚Äôm completely shocked and taken back by this thread. No one ever wants to talk about the real consequences of ‚Äòquantity over quality‚Äô and ‚Äòsave them no matter the outcome‚Äô. A lot of times it almost feels like the people who were ‚Äúsaved‚Äù just enough to be made stable enough to ‚Äúlive‚Äù lives of misery for years in LTC are all but forgotten about they minute they‚Äôre hauled from the hospital and thrown in the nursing home beds were they will remain until death.  

I‚Äôve been in LTC for 10+ years and couldn‚Äôt even begin to count the amount of interventions I‚Äôve witnessed that served no purpose other than prolonging suffering. 40 y/o patient with seizures regularly causing additional areas of the brain to be dead, peg tubed. 70/80/90 y/o patients given peg tubes when they fail to thrive. 80/90 y/o coded even tho they‚Äôve spent the last 10+ years sitting in broada chairs without the ability to feed themselves, use a toilet, or even engage in conversations. Vets bagging to die but having their families override the decision because the guardian wanted to continue to get government checks (this family actually told us they didn‚Äôt care if the guy suffered because they hated him for a bad childhood). People who made it clear they never wanted to live disability but didn‚Äôt put it in writing and  have 1 family member who can‚Äôt let go. 80 y/o loaded onto stretchers from their nursing home beds and hauled to treatment facilities hours away for radiation of cancer that‚Äôs already spread to the bone....... it just goes on and on and on.  

This thread is filled with a stark contrast to anything I would want for myself. It‚Äôs not just me either. I don‚Äôt know anyone who works LTC who doesn‚Äôt regularly say how they would rather die in a hospital parking lot than ever risk a procedure that would/could end with them living in LTC. People have been extra vocal about it this year, ‚Äúif I catch Covid from this place make sure everyone knows I‚Äôm a DNR‚Äù. People in their 20s and 30s saying this. I myself made my sister, a LTC nurse, my POA this year with the explicit instructions ‚Äúdead from Covid tomorrow is a better outcome than even a two week stay LTC‚Äù, DNR, no peg tube, if there‚Äôs even a 25% chance I can‚Äôt continue life as prior it‚Äôs time to start asking about the Fetanyl.  

Many of the supporter of ‚Äúdo everything‚Äù have never spent any meaningful time with a victim of ‚Äúhad everything done‚Äù. They don‚Äôt hear the moans when these people are turned in nursing home beds, they never smelled a pressure sore, they don‚Äôt have people regularly tell them how they ‚Äúwish they could just die‚Äù, they don‚Äôt see the loneliness, the suffering, it‚Äôs not common knowledge that many of these people will only ever see the outdoors again when ambulance workers are hauling them to health appointments.  

I don‚Äôt know what the answers are. I do know that medical ethics leave a lot to be desired. Perhaps I‚Äôm jaded from a decade of LTC.",64

The withdrawals are also comparatively worse than reg h withdrawals so they're gonna keep coming back more frequently. Your tolerance goes up super fast and you're gonna need more and more.

Not letting your partner in during COVID makes sense. Most hospitals aren't allowing visitors unless end of life, vulnerable adult etc.

416,2021-09-14 14:36:43+00:00,"Shadow flipping is a technique whereby a single property is 'sold' several times. Here is just one example:

1. Presales and assignment spots. An unfinished property or condo complex is marketed overseas in China to a network of Chinese buyers before being marketed in Canada to Canadian buyers. 

2. A buyer or group of overseas buyers pool their money together to buy several presale units. Since they aren't Canadian citizens or PRs, they put the assignment spots under the Canadian lawyer's or realtor's office address. Entire condo buildings have been ""sold out"" this way before ever hitting the Canadian market. 

3. The same assignment spot is flipped to subsequent buyers, each time for a hefty profit. This continues in Canada. Each shadow flipper has no intention of actually taking possession of the unit, or are legally unable to due to their status. The property is bid up to insane prices. 

4. Now the show suites are open in Canada. Normal Canadian buyer goes to an open house in Canada and the realtor tells them that all units are sold out 'but are you interested in assignment?' By now the unbuilt condo unit has already been flipped several times, and you are also free to sell your assignment spot for an even higher price for a small transfer fee charged by the developer. 

5. A $300k condo is now sold for $500k after being flipped several times. Let's say each flipper took $50k profit. Repeat en masse.

Now add a burgeoning fentenyl drug trade, sprinkle in Chinese Triad money, and wash the cash in Canadian casinos before funneling that money into Canadian real estate. This creates a perfect storm and the average homebuyer is priced out of the local market. 

The trick is to not be holding the bag when it's fully built and time to close on the property.",1

427,2021-09-13 19:07:16+00:00,"I'd say try to get the hydromorphone increased and maybe get ER morphine like MS Contin instead of the fentanyl patches.

Both myself and my late wife had bad experiences with fenanyl patches in terms of their length of duration.  They're meant to last for 72 hours, I barely got 36 hours from them and my wife would go into withdrawal around the 48 hour mark and spend 24 hours feeing awful because her doctor wouldn't consider changing her pain meds or how often she could change her patch, the callous b\*stard that he was.

My doctor let me change my patches ever 48 hours but it still wasn't enough.  I maybe got 18-20 hours of decent pain relief from each pair of patches but then by the 36 hour mark withdrawal and increased would start to raise it's head.  After a lot of complaining I was switched to MS-Contin.

Whilst my wife was still here, I remember looking around a few chronic pain forums and this issue with fentanyl patches isn't at all unusual, quite a lot of patients have the exact same trouble with them.  As a concept they're a great idea, in practice they're a flawed delivery  system that have for many people only served to exacerbate their suffering.

With Palliative care pain management they normally use a long-acting pain medication e.g., MS Contin and also provide a breakthrough pain medication such as dilaudid, morphine oxycodone but in the quicker-acting instant release tablets, instead of the exended release versions.  There's also a fentanyl nasal spray or lozenge for breakthrough pain but it has a very short duration, like 2 hours or so and again it's expensive.  The other instant release meds like oxycodone or morphine will last more like 6 hours

Fentanyl is a brilliant pain killer, one of the best but the patches are unreliable so for that reason I'd say if you're trying to get something as a long-acting pain reliever MS Contin would have better results; at least there's no danger of going into withdrawal and having increased pain whilst she waits until the 72 hours comes around when fresh patches can be applied.  Doctors are like mechanics, you'll find good ones and some dreadful ones and you need one who's going to work with you on this.

The last thing I'd mention is if you're in the USA and yourself or your mom are having to pay anything towards her pain meds, the fentanyl patches are very expensive compared to morphine or just about any other regularly-used medication.",3

Com um cronograma de produ√ß√£o de seis semanas que acabou se estendendo para seis meses, a rodagem do filme rapidamente ficou conhecida como uma das mais ca√≥ticas na hist√≥ria de Hollywood, por causa da mudan√ßa de diretor ‚Äîde Richard Stanley para John Frankenheimer, logo no come√ßo‚Äî e do comportamento conflitivo de suas vulc√¢nicas estrelas, [Marlon Brando](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/02/28/estilo/1519814215_524318.html) e Val Kilmer. Vendo a hist√≥ria mais de perto, essa era apenas a inofensiva ponta do iceberg.

O document√°rio *Lost soul: A viagem maldita de Richard Stanley √† ilha do Dr. Moreau*, de 2014, analisou o ocorrido sob o ponto de vista do diretor demitido, com os depoimentos de parte da equipe e do est√∫dio que produziu o filme, a New Line Cinema. O document√°rio despertou o interesse dos f√£s do g√™nero fant√°stico ‚Äîfoi premiado no Festival de Sitges daquele ano‚Äî n√£o s√≥ pela curiosidade em conhecer em primeira m√£o os meandros da rodagem de *A ilha do Dr. Moreau*, mas sim pelo reaparecimento de Stanley, promessa do g√™nero no come√ßo dos [anos noventa](https://brasil.elpais.com/cultura/2021-06-27/a-ascensao-queda-e-ressurreicao-de-brendan-fraser-o-heroi-de-hollywood-dos-anos-90.html) por filmes como *Hardware, o destruidor do futuro* (1990), de quem praticamente nunca mais se ouvira falar desde ent√£o.

Gra√ßas ao seu longo depoimento no document√°rio dirigido por David Gregory, ficamos sabendo, por exemplo, que Richard Stanley, de cren√ßas wiccanas (uma religi√£o vinculada √† bruxaria), tinha recorrido a feiti√ßos para conseguir o emprego, e que seu ambicioso roteiro inclu√≠a cenas de [sexo oral ](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/06/10/actualidad/1528643281_831390.html)entre esp√©cies e mutila√ß√µes genitais em primeiro plano.

Cartaz promocional de ‚ÄòA ilha do Dr. Moreau‚Äô com o ator Mark Dacascos caracterizado como uma das estranhas criaturas do filme. Michael Ochs Archives / Getty ImagesDirigir a adapta√ß√£o de *A ilha do doutor Moreau* era um dos grandes sonhos de Stanley. A hist√≥ria do n√°ufrago que chega por acidente √† terra onde um cientista maluco se exilou para realizar seus experimentos de disseca√ß√£o de animais fascinava o cineasta, que passou quatro anos desenvolvendo o roteiro e imaginando os desenhos das criaturas e os cen√°rios. Seu v√≠nculo por descend√™ncia direta com o explorador Henry M. Stanley (1841-1904), autor da c√©lebre frase ‚ÄúDr. Livingstone, suponho‚Äù, colaborador do rei [Leopoldo II da B√©lgica](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2021-06-11/violencia-do-colonialismo-abre-espaco-na-memoria-coletiva-da-europa.html) no genoc√≠dio do Congo e inspira√ß√£o de Joseph Conrad para o personagem Kurtz em *O cora√ß√£o das trevas* (1899), tamb√©m lhe serviu para ganhar a aprova√ß√£o de Marlon Brando, int√©rprete de Kurtz em *Apocalypse now* (1979). E essa inesperada boa rela√ß√£o entre o diretor, ent√£o com apenas 29 anos, e o dif√≠cil Brando foi suficiente para que o est√∫dio inicialmente desse carta branca a Richard Stanley.

Tanto √© que a New Line destinou 40 milh√µes de d√≥lares (o equivalente a mais de 360 milh√µes de reais atuais) ao projeto, embora isso implicasse ignorar alguns outros sinais. ‚ÄúQuando meu assistente nos perguntou o que quer√≠amos tomar, [Stanley] disse ‚Äòum caf√©, por favor, com tr√™s ou quatro cubinhos de a√ß√∫car‚Äô, e a√≠ notei que parecia haver algo de errado naquele sujeito‚Äù, rememorava com ironia em *Lost soul* o fundador do est√∫dio, Robert Shaye, a prop√≥sito de seu primeiro encontro com o [cineasta](https://brasil.elpais.com/noticias/directores-cine/).

O pouco interesse de Richard Stanley em comparecer √†s reuni√µes de trabalho, a inexperi√™ncia √† frente de uma [superprodu√ß√£o ](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2017/05/06/tecnologia/1494086279_329810.html)‚Äîseu filme mais caro, *Dust devil: o colecionador de almas *(1992), tinha tido um or√ßamento de cinco milh√µes de d√≥lares‚Äî e outros tra√ßos err√°ticos em sua conduta (como ligar de madrugada para um produtor pedindo uma mudan√ßa de hotel por motivos misteriosos) levaram o executivo Tim Zinnemann a propor um acr√©scimo de 1,5 milh√£o de d√≥lares ao or√ßamento para conting√™ncias, ou seja, para a eventualidade de que fosse preciso trocar de diretor. Apenas tr√™s dias depois de iniciada a rodagem na costa de Cairns, na Austr√°lia, o cofre do milh√£o e meio se abriu.

Em 1995, a filha de Marlon Brando se suicidou, ent√£o sua participa√ß√£o no projeto esteve por um fio ‚Äîe com ela o status de protegido que Richard Stanley acreditava ter assegurado. De fato, a outra estrela, Val Kilmer, tinha exercido uma firme oposi√ß√£o ao cineasta desde o primeiro minuto. Com [*Batman *](https://brasil.elpais.com/noticias/batman/)*eternamente *rec√©m-estreado, Kilmer estava no auge do seu sucesso comercial, e dirigi-lo era uma tarefa √°rdua. Tinha pedido uma mudan√ßa de personagem, que lhe foi concedida, e, conforme coincidiram em apontar diferentes membros da equipe no document√°rio *Lost soul*, ele se contrapunha a Stanley em todos os aspectos criativos: de falas pr√≥prias e alheias at√© posicionamentos de c√¢mera.

Al√©m disso, do set na [selva ](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2021-09-05/na-selva-das-minas-malditas.html)australiana de Cairns n√£o paravam de chegar not√≠cias esquisitas: o diretor, supostamente, tinha terminado uma das jornadas encarapitado numa √°rvore para n√£o falar com ningu√©m e entrado em p√¢nico quando um furac√£o arrasou o cen√°rio da rodagem. A tens√£o com Kilmer foi estopim para que o est√∫dio o substitu√≠sse por John Frankenheimer sem ter transcorrido nem uma semana inteira. Os rumores de que Stanley planejava queimar o set como repres√°lia levaram tamb√©m a New Line Cinema a lhe pedir que abandonasse a ilha, mas o j√° ex-funcion√°rio desapareceu na mata sem deixar rastro.

Assim, o veterano Frankenheimer, respons√°vel por [cl√°ssicos ](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/09/03/cultura/1567518278_350381.html)como *Sob o dom√≠nio do mal* (1962), incorporou-se ao filme com seu assistente de confian√ßa, James Sbardellati, que observou desconcertado como Stanley e seus produtores tinham planejado parte da rodagem no ponto mais chuvoso da Austr√°lia, s√≥ para ter de fundo nas tomadas exteriores uma montanha que a umidade nunca permitia ver. O car√°ter do novo diretor n√£o conseguiu apaziguar um Val Kilmer em rebeldia, que, segundo v√°rias testemunhas, tinha chegado a apagar um cigarro na cara de um dos t√©cnicos. ‚ÄúNem que eu dirigisse um filme chamado *A vida de Val Kilmer* eu n√£o voltaria a trabalhar com esse babaca!‚Äù, diz-se que Frankenheimer chegou a vociferar.

Val Kilmer em uma cena de ‚ÄòA ilha do Dr. Moreau‚Äô.New Line Cinema / Getty ImagesO ator alem√£o Marco Hofschneider tamb√©m acabou vendo seu papel minguar porque Val Kilmer n√£o gostava de contracenar com ele. E o desembarque final de Marlon Brando, longe de arrumar as coisas, foi sua senten√ßa. Frankenheimer tinha uma p√©ssima opini√£o sobre o roteiro de Richard Stanley e havia exigido uma reescrita, mas o protagonista de [*O Poderoso Chef√£o*](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/03/25/cultura/1553527664_046647.html) tamb√©m chegou √† Austr√°lia com ideias pr√≥prias. Hofschneider encarnava M‚ÄôLing, mordomo do Dr. Moreau, mas Brando se afei√ßoou pelo ator dominicano Nelson de la Rosa, um an√£o de 71 cent√≠metros de altura, e tomou a decis√£o radical de substituir o ator alem√£o, e que no seu lugar De la Rosa o acompanhasse continuamente na tela, como bra√ßo-direito. A equipe de figurino criou √†s pressas r√©plicas da roupa de Brando em miniatura para que ambos andassem combinando. O resultado serviu de inspira√ß√£o ao comediante Mike Myers para criar o Mini Me, sequaz do Dr. Evil na saga *Austin Powers*.

As contribui√ß√µes de Brando (que n√£o decorou suas falas e pediu que as recitassem por um ponto eletr√¥nico, vis√≠vel em v√°rios planos) foram al√©m. Alegou que Moreau sofria uma agressiva alergia ao sol e por isso, nas cenas externas, deveria estar impregnado por um chamativo creme branco, o que, casualmente, facilitava que um dubl√™ fizesse as tomadas longas no seu lugar. Tamb√©m, por causa do calor, solicitou que um balde com gelo fosse incorporado √† cabe√ßa do personagem. Mais adiante, desenvolvendo essa ideia, pediu a John Frankenheimer que interrompesse a produ√ß√£o ‚Äúpor seis ou oito semanas‚Äù para reescreverem o filme juntos: lhe ocorreu que o doutor Moreau poderia ser um [golfinho](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/07/08/ciencia/1562598619_961566.html), e mant√™-lo hidratado seria a justificativa para o balde de gelo.

When talking about other harder drugs, it's a more complicated subject. Cocaine, meth, heroin, benzos, etc. Doesn't inherently make you violent. I have never hurt anybody in my life except myself. Some people DO become violent due to addiction, or pre existing mental conditions that got worse after taking chemical drugs that affect your mental state, but it isn't any different or more frequent than alcohol, which is completely legal.

What increases violent crimes is the fact that drug users are considered criminals by default. The drug is only sold trough organized crimes or small time dealers. Addiction can get you debt from criminal organizations which is dangerous.

 The fact that you have to hide your consumption from the government prevents addicts to get help because they do not want to be considered criminals and go to jail. In consequences these addicts will stay hidden and will live amongst other addicts and criminal organizations, which can encourage violent behavior due to gang violence, having to steal or find money to feed your addiction  if you don't you'll die), and plenty of other situations that can easily be prevented by legalizing the use of drugs, legalizing the sale of drugs by social organizations made Ina regulated lab which can prevent addicts from getting drugs laced with another more dangerous product like fantanyl in cocaine.

503,2021-09-11 01:58:08+00:00,This worries me about many diseases that may have potential cures. Theoretically if there was a cure for some obscure disease that a research team found under one of these large pharmaceutical companies the stakeholders would commit to deciding whether or not releasing the cure of this obscure disease is more or less profitable than continuing to sell overpriced medication for the disease. If everyone is cured then you have self eliminated  the entire target consumer from your balance sheet deducting a share of profits. It‚Äôs fucked but if you think about it these companies are so motivated by profit that secretly holding cures from release for obscure diseases may be in their best interest in able to keep a flow of profit by selling medication for the disease. There is no bar low enough many companies are willing to cross in able to keep the money flowing as seen with the opioid crisis and oxycotin.,1

The possibilities of what the paper trail might look like under 3rd party scrutiny involves several factors, like:
- Exactly how much scrutiny is being applied? Are you a literal fentanol dealing mass murderer planning to strike again? Or is it just Uncle Sam paying some chain analysis firms for whatever info they got?
- Did you only ever connect those wallets over Tor? And only connect to the exchange(s) in question over Tor?
- Did you send messages/emails regarding your original purchase, either over clearnet, or that are attached to your identity, which could tie that original purchase to you identity?

Your son was in posession of those 7 bags, and *is also* being charged with whatever drugs the other people had?

Your son wasn't in possession of any drugs and is being charged as an accessory to the crimes of these other people?

Unfortunately if it is the first one your son is in a huge amount of trouble as fentanyl laced drugs have been killing thousands of people during this ongoing opioid crisis.  The law will hit him hard as prosecutors are not understanding towards people who play ignorant about the risks f this substance and are poisoning the drug supply.  Depending on where you are, he could be looking at life in prison for distribution among other things...if he has been distributing fenanyl in any capacity, prison is probably the best place for him.

If it's the latter and he really had no involvement, he needs a lawyer and to absolutely try and get a plea deal to throw everyone else under the bus.  Relinquish and produce all text messages, phone records, etc.  The risk of a plea deal for information is, if these other people have friends on the outside or ever get out, they will probably come after your son in a very bad way...and possibly anyone else they know the whereabouts of.

562,2021-09-08 18:56:13+00:00,"In 2016 I suddenly got an ""galstone"" attack. Then my attacks became more frequent and the pain was so heavy that I had to go to the ER to get 4 fentanyl shots via a needle and pass out to feel no pain.

They thought it was my galbladder so they removed it. This was a bad idea because in the end it didn't turned up to be my galbladder and doctors didn't knew what I had. And in 2019 my pain became daily, the same pain that my stomache felt like it was being cut with a knife. 

So I finally got Oxycodon, that didnt helped, so then they moved to 3x 100mcg fentanyl sublingual.

The pain still wasn't manageable, so they gave me 25mcg/h fentanyl patches, since half 2019 they eventually changed my dose to 3x 300mcg fentanyl sublingual and 1x 100mcg/h every 2 days. That worked for a long time and a specialist finally found what I have, my diagnosis is ACNES, it's a nerve disfunction, and because my galbladder was operationally removed on the same place where my nerves hurt, it became a catalyst for extreme pain daily. I mean I can't even hug my gf without having pain. 

And ofcourse my pain came back, and I figured that if I change my patch every 4 days, I have one patch extra that I can extract the fentanyl with 96% drinkable ethanol and create 4x 10ml bottles of fentanyl droplets to use under my tongue. Luckily i've seen a official way to extraxt fentanyl and i've been doing it wrong because I ended up with a lot of adhesive so most of the fentanyl stayed in the adhesive and not in the ethanol.

So since yesterday I used a half 75mcg/h patch and my withdrawal symptoms are very minimal, so I consider myself very lucky.

I am a veteran in withdrawals, because I used to be addicted to GHB and had to redose every 2 hours otherwise I could die. I also endured a couple of benzo and phenibut withdrawal so i know what to expect and how to handle it.

I never touched anything since 2013, and I did't use more fentanyl because it feels nice, but because my pain makes my life a living hell. I had many treatments and there are more treatments to come, Luckily i've only gone above my dose for a couple of weeks so I hope the withdrawal gods are kind to me so I eventually find a treatment that is manageable for my pain and I can quit fentanyl all together. It isn't fun, it sucks my emotions right out me. It's just the pain that's in the way.

Thanks",2

So people are going to lump all companies together. In my opinion, it's a self-inflicted wound. People expect mistakes and some minor issues, but the last twelve years polarized political climate and companies getting hammered for lying or really fucking up, fueled the fire greatly.

But...its sad.   Women wearing make up.   They don't need to put that skin cancer causing goop on their face.   But women have been doing it for centuries.   

Its a superficial, lookists, society.   The people who have the surgeries, have low self-esteem.    Every single one.    And often, like in the case of my Chinese friend, she was the victim of bulllying.   She's same age as me.   Around 50.   50 years ago, there wasn't a large Asian population like there is now.

Also, really...doctors should not perform these types of surgeries.   Especially the eye lid one.   If a patient goes to a doctor and asks for 10 bottles of oxycotin...its the doctors responsibility to say 'no'.    Patients don't always also medical issues that well.  Because they don't have 8 years of medical education.  

I realize...ultimately its a choice.    But the choice is made because of prejudices that exists in society.   We live in an extremely 'lookists' society.

O que Cam√µes fez foi popularizar Viriato como l√≠der de um dos povos que existia em parte do territ√≥rio que hoje √© Portugal.

O uso de Viriato como um heroi Lusitano aparece porque as epopeias cl√°ssicas usavam modelos de guerreiros her√≥icos como mitos criadores unificadores de uma na√ß√£o.

A Odisseia de Homero usa Ulisses. Os Lus√≠adas, como odisseia dos Portugueses, usa eventualmente Cam√µes como um dos her√≥is fundamentais da p√°tria Portuguesa:  


""Assim o Gentio diz.  Responde o Gama:  
‚Äî ""Este que v√™s, pastor j√° foi de gado;  
Viriato sabemos que se chama,  
Destro na lan√ßa mais que no cajado;  
Injuriada tem de Roma a fama,  
Vencedor invenc√≠vel afamado;  
N√£o tem com ele, n√£o, nem ter puderam  
O primor que com Pirro j√° tiveram.""

O uso de Viriato como um s√≠mbolo guerreiro Portugu√™s faz algum sentido quando sabemos que foi ele que uniu as v√°rias tribos ib√©ricas e liderou esta coliga√ß√£o militarmente, e com sucesso, contra Roma.

O problema √© que se julga que, da√≠ para  a frente espalha-se o mito popular de que Viriato e os Lusitanos s√£o a fonte origin√°ria dos Portugueses. Na verdade, n√£o. N√£o o s√£o. Os Romanos sempre disseram que as for√ßas de Viriato eram compostas por v√°rias tribos, entre as quais os Galaicos. Al√©m disso, a vasta maioria do territ√≥rio Lustinano nem sequer se encontra no que se entende hoje como ""Lusit√¢nia"". A maioria seria no que √© hoje territ√≥rio Espanhol sendo que a regi√£o administrativa da Lusitania representa uma decis√£o arbitr√°ria de Roma que n√£o tem sustento arqueol√≥gico ou √©tnico absolutamente nenhum.

Pelo contr√°rio, a Gal√©cia, de onde nasce a coroa, a l√≠ngua e o projecto independentista Portugu√™s, tem as suas fronteiras administrativas suportadas pelo limite da cultura castreja do Noroeste Peninuslar.

Resumindo, Cam√µes e a sua obra √©pica sobre os feitos Portugueses popularizou o mito Lusitano. Hoje em dia a palavra Luso √© usada de forma profundamente errada como origem dos Portugueses.

Outra raz√£o pela qual este mito foi t√£o facilmente aceite prende-se com a necessidade de Portugal de se afastar do seu nome real. Portugal √© puramente Galego (a palavra Galiza vem da origem do Porto e Braga foi a sua capital hist√≥rica durante s√©culos) mas os seus primos a Norte, com quem andou em guerra e escaramu√ßas durante muito tempo, j√° usavam o nome Galiza, e com direito, como seu.

Portanto, como raio nos √≠amos identificar etnicamente se o nosso nome real estava agora associado a inimigos com os quais nos t√≠nhamos separado?

A palavra GALEGO desenvolve-se ent√£o como um adjectivo pejorativo com o intuito de designar algo de pequeno, fraco, vulgar ou submisso. Ainda hoje √© usada desta forma em v√°rias situa√ß√µes, nomes e top√≥nimos.

Assim sendo, o ""ref√∫gio"" em termos de nomenclatura da identidade nacional recaiu nestes Lusitanos que, apesar de n√£o existirem como regi√£o e povo definido h√° tantos s√©culos, era a √∫nico factor de raiz unit√°rio com o qual nos pod√≠amos identificar de certa maneira.

Cam√µes foi apenas o mais famoso perpetuador deste mito.",4

I could go on for hours about my horrible 13 years, I'm not going to lie I still have bad days, I've had to fight my inner demons alot since my accident. I was 33 living in a nursing home because Noone wanted me, so I guess I'm entitled to a bad day once in awhile.

It wont tell you 99% purity, but it will tell you what reactive additives is in your shit.

As a dealer, there is no reason to not pre-test.   

Nobody who buys at even the chinese oz (25g) doesnt test purchases. And it is easy.

Also, unlike the tv shows, high-end dealers, I mean the kind who make a living and make friends with concierge, lawyers, bankers, PR specialists, music venue managers, newspaper interns, agents, are out to kill customers.   They rely on customer loyalty and word of mouth of art/music community.
 
When Philip Seymor Hofman died, he died because some fuckers mixed fentanyl in with heroin.  While this has somehow been lost to the world, in 2014 on East Coast there was a huge spike in deaths associated with fentanyl mixed in with dilaudid, heroin, oxymorphone, and other opioids.

This was crazy because nobody would mix fentanyl with other opoids.  It isn‚Äôt cost effective.  It is very dangerous, fentanyl is for time-release patches, not mainline IV.

The real worry was NONE of the dealers could identify fentanyl in their shit because there was no specific litmus or dropper tests that can  differentiated fentanyl from  heroin or dilaudid or oxymorphone or morphine 

Not wwithout a gas  chromatography and mass spectrometry, i.e. a chemistry laboratory. 

In other words, nobody who made a living at that trade could have know.  Nobody would take fentanyl to spike their heroin or opoids. 

It was valuable in its own right, and nobody is that stupid.   Not in that racket.

Nobody ever figured out why the fentanyl was mixed into everything in NYC back when Hoffman died.

The word was, and I believe this, that some federal agencies sold the shit mixed, KNOWING the dealers couldnt test for it.  They are doing it again.

Why?

Kill a fat white actor and they get massive funding and judges will sign warrantless wiretaping on street level dealers under FISA and patriot act.

The DEA and FBI wanted a casus belli to go after east coast dealers.   The ones connecting to music communities.

So they spiked the shit.

They do it all the time.  Nobody caresm its just dead people with a human frailty.  You know ‚Äúdrug addicts‚Äù wear yellow stars.

The feds got smart with fetanyl.  But only if they stick to mixing it with opioids.

I can easily tell you how many times ‚Äúcrack‚Äù has been stepped on.

I just need 1 hour, a pair of gloves and some inexpensive chemical testing equipment.

I can tell you if the drug has known poisons or laced with drugs that change the effect.

I have found cocaine mixed with mostly crystal meth, many times.    Crystal meth ‚Äúice‚Äù costs more than cocaine, so again it made no sense, but you do a fat cocaine line that is actually close to pure crystal meth,  you gonna die from a heart attack or aneurism.  

Once I found a high level of the awful hallucinogen DXM mixed into cocaine rocks.  

No fucking reason for that either,

Multiple times I found higher than trace levels of arsenic in cocaine rocks.

Inorganic arsenic tests different than organic arsenic.   Nobody has inorganic arsenic just sitting around to lace cocaine rocks with.

Except unscrupulous  feds who sell lots and lots of drugs undercover without having to report it to anyone.

Thing is‚Ä¶ nobody will ever believe this is true.

I have sat in a room with people who spoke a different language, explaining wherever they got that shit, it would kill people over time.

649,2021-09-06 06:58:51+00:00,"TL;DR: Plugging and the other RoA's skips the metabolism step of the long oral route to get to your brain and receptors faster and without changing/losing much if any of said drug along the way. This works with MOST recreational drugs, excluding pro-drugs ( codeine, vyvanse, some LSD related Research chems ) and things like tramadol which does have different effects on its own, but has to be metabolized to O-Desmethyl-tramodol for opioid effects.

Most things have a higher BA this way because it doesn't go through first pass metabolism, which breaks down and starts filtering or changes the chemical in a way to make it active for humans before passing It to the brain. This also means you will lose some to most of the drug from the metabolism process depending on a bunch of different things including your body's ability to metabolize a certain drug in a specific way.

The drugs that need to be metabolized this way (pro-drugs like codeine or vyvanse have to be changed in your body by enzymes/ pathways to work at all; while some other drugs that are active by themselves, or at least have other purposes  it can be used for, will turn into stronger drugs in your body like the codones turning into the related morphones and tramadol turning into O-Desmethyl-tramodol) to work are not going to be better/faster administered another way.

The other routes are better for most already active drugs because you get a rush, more intense high, much faster onset, higher bioavailability either from:

- Straight injection to the bloodstream ( intravenously )/ spinal chord ( epideral or intrathecal ) / muscle tissue ( muscling if injection wasn't too shallow as I know I've done a few times ) / right under your skin layer( skin popping, or missing a vein right under the first skin layer )

-Absorbing from the little ""capillary filters"" in the lungs your body uses to put oxygen from breathing air to your bloodstream ( smoking, vaporization )

-Or absorbed into mucus membranes ( snorting ) / salivary glands ( under the tongue or sublingually ) / major blood vessels in certain body cavities ( shelving if by vaginal administration, plugging for EVERYONE with a rectal cavity  )",0

The war on drugs was started as a way to persecute the black power movement and hippies, literally. The person who created the modern concept of the war on drugs even said so. 

So far it has wasted trillions of dollars and ruined millions of lives, and drugs are more available than ever. Without the war on drugs, there wouldn't be the fentany problem where dealers are cutting every type of drug with fent in an attempt to make already addictive drugs even more addictive, but when an opiate naive person buys their coke and it contains a hotspot of fent, they die. And this has happened to thousands of people. No one should have to die just because they want to get high...

The war on drugs has failed by every metric you could apply to it. It wastes money and ruins lives. End the war on drugs today!",0

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

It was harder to get it on the street and more expensive so heroin made a comeback. That increased overdoses Little later fentnyl cam into the mix overdosws skyrocketed so they made it even harder to get prescribed and cutting people off and now overdoses are even higher than before.

If you think *just* rolling back state power will kneecap these people and their malice, you need to look back into history and see what happened when there was no formal arrangement for citizens to leverage power against bad actors.

The more power a state has, the more passionately it will be sought after by bad actors.

Also few of the products you may mention are actively combined with every other product which leads to inadvertent ODs due to people who put all their trust into pharmacists and doctors blindly take anything they are prescribed with minimal to no investigation as to side effects, cross contamination and interactions effects or is actively marketed (too the limited degree drug marketing is allowed) as being safe safe safe and if in pain just take done more. 
Very bad advice for people who live cotton wool cosseted lives who actually begin feeling pain so they start munching Panadol pills hoping for some effect. 
Very quickly they take Gram amounts then throw down other brand name products which will probably just be differing formulations of Panadol (Maybe with some caffeine or some other of your ‚Äúmore lethal than Panadol‚Äù product) when a good dosage of maybe 60-100mg of codeiene or 5-10-15mg of morpheine would actually stop the pain and put a much lower excretion loading onto your heptic and kidney systems. 

If actual pain killers were available then we wouldn‚Äôt have huge volumes of people causing massive damage to themselves. 
Maybe as per any population of people, a certain statistical volume of people will become addicted, however most of these people if they have a real want of opiates aren‚Äôt going to go, ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs illegal or my doc says I should it take much more‚Äù (cutting their script immediately rather that titrating doses) they‚Äôll search out Smack or street pills. 
So they then become more difficult to treat and could take years to seek out treatment rather than having a medical professional overseeing their usage and at least being able to offer assistance, guidance, safety and treatment if/when requested. 
Not many Heroin dealers will say to their clients, mate, maybe you should slow down a little or maybe call number 1xxx-5xx-4xx for when you want to quit.",-6

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

This means we don't make great choices and have reduced capacity for problem solving. Avoid this state at all costs. I'll post a link if you're interested in hearing more. In short, it is what is predominantly responsible for the ""fight, flight, freeze or fawn"" responses. Also when you're upset you release a lot of neurotransmitters, dimorphine, adrenaline, even dopamine (surprising, I know) while these neurotransmitters are active and not yet metabolized, it only increases anxiety and the subsequent symptoms such as psychosis.

Se o Arrascaeta tivesse dado um passe sem querer de saco pro gol da virada seria t√£o valioso quanto o que o Diego fez, cobrar plasticidade num lance decididor de t√≠tulo devia ser pass√≠vel pena de morte com toda liberdade que a hip√©rbole humor√≠stica me permite.

E outra, ""entrou na final do mundial e foi uma nulidade"" deve ser a segunda coisa mais imbecil que eu li hoje, evito at√© comentar sobre porque parece que n√≥s est√°vamos enfrentando a Portuguesa do RJ. E esse ponto sobre os bots pra cuidar da imagem dele √© papo de chap√©uzinho de alum√≠nio pirado que n√£o acredita em vacina.

Com tudo isso em conta vejo que voc√™ deve ser um xiita totalmente fora de si e longe da raz√£o, por√©mmm eu tendo a discordar da maioria da torcida que defende o Diego, n√£o querendo dar voz para as suas sandices, √© poss√≠vel defender a sa√≠da do Diego sem falar merda.

Nunca acompanhei tanto assim o cara porque nunca gostei tanto dele pessoalmente, pra mim ele representa o √°pice do jogador egoc√™ntrico, que todos s√£o, mas ele parece emanar mais ainda essa aura, potencializado ao vir pro Brasil (quando comecei a acompanhar mais ele), meu ponto √© que o Ribas sempre tentou aparecer como protagonista por aqui mesmo sendo pra sempre um codjuvante de luxo, esse √© a raiz do problema. Ele se p√µe num papel que n√£o √© capaz de segurar, al√©m disso se p√µe pra ser cr√≠ticado por tal papel que n√£o tem capacidade de exercer, s√£o duas coisas que n√£o fazem sentido em cima da outra, nunca critiquei o Diego por o que ele faz ou deixa de fazer, mas sim porque ele e todos em volta insistem em deixar ele tentar preencher os sapatos de um protagonista.

Diego n√£o √© camisa 10 + faixa assim como o Ribeiro n√£o √© capit√£o, os dois obviamente s√£o se voc√™ for ver os jogos, mas muito mal escolhidos para serem ao meu ver, n√£o tem nenhuma das caracter√≠sticas pra estarem l√°, o Ribas ent√£o s√≥ tem o egocentrismo monstro mas bem pouco pra carregar e fazer jus a essa fachada. Esses dois jogadores se encontram l√° por outros motivos, o Ribeiro pela """"""""""lideran√ßa t√©cnica"""""""""" que pra mim j√° √© uma blasfemia l√≠der t√©cnico ser capit√£o, n√£o to nem questionando se ele exerce esse papel, e o Diego pelo ego e por ser muito bem quisto por todos do clube, e sim, isso √© uma qualidade do cara, n√£o adianta fazer cara feia, ele deixa o ambiente mais leve, basicamente a mesma qualidade que dizem ter Rodinei e Renato Ga√∫cho, os famosos ""bons de grupo"" ou ""reis de vesti√°rio"".

E pra mim todas as falhas esportivas descritas no post principal at√© essa merda sobre o Mundial derivam disso, ele falhou n√£o por que √© ruim pro Flamengo, mas sim porque ele t√° fora de seu papel de coadjuvante de luxo.

Como eu tinha dito, pra mim deveriamos ter deixado ele ir ao fim do contrato ali em 19, mas como renovaram por 1.5 ano e veio o JJ pra colocar pela primeira vez ele no papel dele (com ""ajuda"" da les√£o que acelerou isso), pra mim acabou indo e tava de boa, √© um coadjuvante de luxo pra poder enfrentar equipes menos f√≠sicas e principalmente se estiverem retrancadas, ou at√© como ele entrou bem no final da liberta, equipes que est√£o ajustadinhas para marcar bem nosso time, basta um jogador que segura mais a bola pra gerar espa√ßos, resumindo ele ainda foi √∫til, voc√™ pode n√£o ver custo benef√≠cio nessas utilidades pelo sal√°rio dele mas isso s√£o outros 500.

Agora, pra mim erraram feio em dar mais um ano pro cara, era pra ter deixado acabar em 2020 e agradecer os servi√ßos prestados, como renovaram eu venho de advogado do diabo pra dizer que ele de 1o volante assim como Gabi carregando e Ar√£o na zaga foram vitais pra reta final do Brasileir√£o de 2020 que ganhamos apesar do monte de merda que o Ceni fez, e √© isso que o Diego serviu, deixou de ser coadjuvante de luxo do JJ pra ser inven√ß√£o meio gambiarra que deu certo, essas foram suas qualidades, agora eu n√£o entendo parte da torcida que toma essa gambiarra de momento como o seu novo papel no elenco, o cara n√£o aguenta jogar na posi√ß√£o mais, a zaga fica muito mais desguarnecida e o pior que nem parece ser culpa diretamente dele ent√£o muitos nem criticam, s√≥ veem que o meio campo do Flamengo t√° cheio de espa√ßos e os dois volantes sempre correndo atr√°s do meio campo dos advers√°rios.

Ent√£o pra mim sim, j√° passou da hora dele vazar, de forma alguma expulsar o cara, ele tem sim m√©ritos e qualidades como eu citei e deve ir pela porta da frente, mas pra mim elas passam longe das qualidades de um camisa 10 ou √≠dolo como muitos gritam aos sete ventos. Diego foi um bom coajudvante de luxo em 19 com grande participa√ß√£o na conquista da Libertadores e depois na gambiarra que nos deu o BR de 20 naquele recorte de menos de 10 jogos, um jogador folcl√≥rico pra mim, mas nada al√©m disso, na real quero ele longe da gente num campeonato que dura 38 rodadas com jogos de 3 em 3 dias, porque pra isso n√£o tem condi√ß√£o nenhuma, pra um lance aqui ou ali, uma arrancada aqui ou ali √© o que n√≥s vamos nos lembrar dele.
