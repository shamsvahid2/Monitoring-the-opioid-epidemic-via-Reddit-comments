Lo que yo digo que podr√≠a acarrear mucho riesgo es legalizar drogas como la coca y heroina, es decir que se puedan producir y comercializar libremente.

O problema √© que se voc√™ compara o que aconteceu com Dilma e o que acontece hoje √© absurdo, dilma diferente de lula que foi inocentado pois a provas foi obtidas de maneira ilegal, n√£o puderam ser usadas, isso n√£o faz ele ser inocente

Dilma se me lembro bem ela s√≥ foi acusada de incopetencia, mal gest√£o, ela fez menos que o atual governo e saiu mais rapido e por interesses de um grupo menor e pelo visto mais importante

Hoje o presidente atual faz amea√ßas o tempo todo, compra voto na cara de pau, comete crimes, manda diretas amea√ßando todo mundo, lutou contra varias coisas importantes e n√£o aconteceu nada com ele

N√£o gosto de defender politico, pois acredito que em geral eles lutam por si, e as vezes beneficiam a popula√ß√£o, o que me deixa triste √© a v√™ a diferen√ßa de tratamento de um cara que faz merda e todo mundo v√™ para o que aconteceu no passado

 ""Eu afirmo veementemente que a J√∫lia est√° mentindo"", diz Bernardo Bello em entrevista √† coluna.

 Um dos trunfos que a defesa de Bernardo Bello acredita ter √© o pedido de conserva√ß√£o da grava√ß√£o de uma conversa entre ele e [o atual marido de J√∫lia, o empres√°rio Eduardo Giraldes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2021/08/demostenes-deixa-defesa-de-viuva-de-miliciano-ligado-a-flavio-bolsonaro.shtml), que √© fabricante de azeite. O[ presidente Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/jair-bolsonaro/) √© citado no di√°logo.

 Bernardo Bello e Giraldes se encontraram em junho, [antes que a proposta de dela√ß√£o de J√∫lia Lotufo viesse a p√∫blico](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2021/07/promotoras-abandonam-investigacao-sobre-morte-de-marielle-franco.shtml) ‚Äîmas quando j√° corriam rumores de que a vi√∫va poderia colaborar com a Justi√ßa e prejudicar Bello.

  Investigada em processo que tramita na 1¬™ Vara Criminal Especializada do Rio, [ela √© acusada de lavagem de dinheiro a servi√ßo da mil√≠cia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/04/foragida-viuva-de-miliciano-ligado-a-flavio-bolsonaro-ganha-direito-a-prisao-domiciliar-por-ser-mae.shtml). Est√° em pris√£o domiciliar, de tornozeleira, e tenta uma dela√ß√£o premiada para se livrar de eventuais penas e deixar o Brasil com o novo marido, Eduardo, que conheceu alguns meses depois da[ morte do capit√£o Adriano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/entenda-a-morte-de-miliciano-e-os-elos-dele-com-flavio-bolsonaro.shtml).

 Na conversa com Giraldes, Bello afirma que os promotores n√£o estariam interessados nele (""√© √≥bvio que o que querem n√£o √© o bobalh√£o aqui""), mas sim que a vi√∫va do miliciano ""fale de [Jair] Bolsonaro"".

 [O capit√£o Adriano era ligado √† fam√≠lia do presidente da Rep√∫blica ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/01/ex-pm-estava-preso-por-homicidio-quando-flavio-bolsonaro-o-homenageou.shtml)e foi citado na investiga√ß√£o que apura a pr√°tica conhecida como[ ""rachadinha"" no gabinete de Fl√°vio Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/11/rachadinha-aumentou-patrimonio-de-flavio-bolsonaro-em-r-1-milhao-diz-promotoria.shtml) quando ele era deputado estadual pelo Rio de Janeiro.

 ""N√£o vai falar"", responde o atual marido de J√∫lia sobre Bolsonaro. ""Se ela souber, e ela quiser falar"", emenda Bernardo Bello. ""Mas se souber, eu tamb√©m n√£o vou deixar ela falar"", segue Eduardo Giraldes.

 Bernardo diz ent√£o acreditar que, se citar Bolsonaro, v√£o acabar com J√∫lia ""de verde, amarelo, azul e branco"".

 ""Se ela n√£o quiser falar... meu irm√£o, at√© porque, sabe por qu√™? Vai acabar com a vida dessa menina"", afirma o ex-presidente da[ Vila Isabel](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/02/vila-isabel-salgueiro-e-beija-flor-se-destacam-com-luxo-samba-chiclete-e-pouca-critica-social.shtml).

 O marido de J√∫lia concorda: ""E com a minha"".

 **(Ou√ßa a grava√ß√£o do trecho da conversa em que Bernardo Bello e Eduardo Giraldes falam sobre Bolsonaro)**

 O di√°logo mostraria, segundo a defesa de Bello, que a tentativa de colabora√ß√£o da vi√∫va n√£o reflete o que ela de fato sabe e viveu.[ Adriano da N√≥brega foi morto em 2020 numa opera√ß√£o policial](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/entenda-a-morte-de-miliciano-e-os-elos-dele-com-flavio-bolsonaro.shtml) e, segundo relato de seu advogado, Paulo Emilio Catta Preta, [temia ser alvo de ""queima de arquivo""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/advogado-diz-que-miliciano-ligado-a-flavio-bolsonaro-tinha-certeza-de-que-seria-morto.shtml).

 A conversa de Bernardo Bello com Giraldes poderia ainda endossar o argumento da defesa de que Bello n√£o tinha proximidade e muito menos associa√ß√£o com o capit√£o Adriano.

 O empres√°rio repete isso em diversos momentos da conversa com Giraldes. O atual marido da vi√∫va do miliciano, por sua vez, afirma na grava√ß√£o que J√∫lia ""n√£o tem nada contra"" Bernardo Bello.

 O marido de J√∫lia diz ainda no di√°logo que j√° gastou R$ 6 milh√µes com advogados para que ela ficasse [presa em regime domiciliar, como foi autorizado pelo Superior Tribunal de Justi√ßa (STJ)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/04/foragida-viuva-de-miliciano-ligado-a-flavio-bolsonaro-ganha-direito-a-prisao-domiciliar-por-ser-mae.shtml). E afirma precisar de mais R$ 6 milh√µes para derrubar a medida cautelar e reaver o passaporte da mulher. Giraldes afirma que os dois t√™m planos de se mudar para o exterior.

 Uma parte da grava√ß√£o[ foi divulgada pelo site Brasil de Fato na semana passada](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2021/08/24/se-viuva-de-nobrega-delata-bolsonaro-sua-vida-acaba-diz-suposto-socio-do-escritorio-do-crime). A coluna teve acesso a outros trechos, in√©ditos, da conversa.

 Bernardo Bello confirmou √† **Folha** o conte√∫do do di√°logo, inclusive as falas do trecho em que o [presidente Jair Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/jair-bolsonaro) √© citado. Seu advogado, Fernando Fernandes, afirma que pedir√° uma per√≠cia do registro.

 O marido de J√∫lia Lotufo, Eduardo Giraldes, por sua vez, enviou mensagem √† coluna afirmando que sua defesa se manifesta nos seguintes termos: ""A grava√ß√£o que foi vazada para a m√≠dia n√£o retrata a √≠ntegra da grava√ß√£o, e a forma colocada na m√≠dia deturpa e manipula os fatos. A defesa s√≥ vai se manifestar mediante publica√ß√£o da grava√ß√£o na √≠ntegra"".

 ### A DELA√á√ÉO

 As tratativas de J√∫lia Lotufo com o Minist√©rio P√∫blico do Rio de Janeiro para fazer dela√ß√£o come√ßaram em junho.

 A vi√∫va de Adriano da N√≥brega hoje [cumpre pris√£o domiciliar por determina√ß√£o do Superior Tribunal de Justi√ßa (STJ)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/04/foragida-viuva-de-miliciano-ligado-a-flavio-bolsonaro-ganha-direito-a-prisao-domiciliar-por-ser-mae.shtml).

You would think though, with a pharmaceutical company literally paying out hundreds of millions as we speak because they promoted and distributed a miracle drug capable of combating chronic pain, nearly addiction free and abuse-proof all while making sure to target impoverished areas with high unemployment, low opportunity, labor intense communities with high injuries.....   we now know they were lying the whole time just so they could make billions off the drugs that are now synonymous with corporate greed (OxyContin and MsContin, I know the devastation seeing as I‚Äôm a resident of West Virginia). 

Bottom line is, I don‚Äôt trust these people. I believe it‚Äôs Pfizer that raked in 6billiin, with a B only in the last QUARTER!!!  That‚Äôs insane. And when you learn there‚Äôs a 99.98% survival rate, no repercussions or payouts if this thing goes south. Also taking into account, the industry was able to lobby through Congress User Fees in the early 90s basically basically passing drugs only to the highest bidder. And lastly, consider that fact the every company has a completely different vaccine, different formula, different patent and the government says, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter that they don‚Äôt really work, don‚Äôt care which one, just take one of them‚Äù tells me this has nothing to do with public safety (otherwise insulin, antibiotics, and epipens would be free and available at your local pharmacy where they‚Äôd pay YOU to take them) and all it has to do with is control, comply, assimilate and divide.

42,2021-08-29 17:34:33+00:00,"Chemistry, unlike particle physics, is an egalitarian science. At some scales, like the modern high-throughput screening and large parallel syntheses of hundreds of analogues at once as practiced by big pharma, are less accessible to the average bear. But if you take things step-by-step, one compound at a time, you can make just about anything. (you probably shouldn't try making acetone peroxide and leave it unattended on a bus, best to keep nitroglycerine and TATP etc to the ~~al-queda~~ experts).

But as far as making your own drugs, not only do i think its splendid, I do it myself. I havent supported the cartels or the shangai RC pirates for the better part of a decade. the types of potent opioids to which I have grown accustomed will remain unnamed as people tend to label those who mention the ""Car\*\*\*\*\*\*\*"" word as borderline terrorists. An ""Opana bin-Lortab"". The only creature that I have genuinely terrorized was my poor kitty when Ive been bartarded out of my gourd. 

I dont judge people based on their particular drug of choice. To judge the opioids as something ""off-limits"" while welcoming stimulants, Quaaludes and barbiturates would seem to set a double standard. A sackrilege. Dime Bag bigotry. 

Anything that puts the science back in the hands of the people and wrenches control of happiness and the freedom to pursue that of the chemical persuasion...should be encouraged. The medical establishment and the Big Pharma are all a bunch of crooks. Deeply in bed with the FDA and regulatory agencies since the very inception of the concept of ""drug control."" Just look at the sordid history of Oxycontin. Shortly after the milennium, the FDA and DEA issued a joint statement saying they were ""acknowledging *abuse resistant large-dose* opioid painkillers as less addictive and they would act to ease restrictions on the liberal dispensation of these drugs.""  Of course this was merely a poorly guised endorsement of oxycontin, as MSContin, the other ""abuse deterrent"" (which is a joke of a concept) opioid on the market, was actually developed by Purdue Pharma in the 1980s. MScontin was a test-case for the market for large-dose time release opioids. It was successful, but ten years later when Oxycontin was released, the sales reach blockbuster proportion at a pace that would make the Waffen-SS look like they were senile retirees in Boca.  


Pharma does not have your best interest in mind. It prefers you addicted to their products. Once youre hooked on the percocet or lortab, they label you an addict, and then proceed to get you hooked on methadone or buprenorphine. The pain patient to addict business model is more lucrative than the original ""Purdue/oxy"" strategy.

43,2021-08-29 17:32:56+00:00,"It didn't feel like waking up from a deep sleep, probably because I believe I had some level of consciousness or awareness for most of it but was not fully conscious or able to communicate or control my body. I know that the first part of it I was in critical condition and a heavy coma non reactive to stimulus ie verbal cues/pain and in multi-system failure, requiring ventilation and other measures. I don't have any memories from that period, at least not yet, and am unsure how long it lasted.
Next it was a semiconscious state and my condition would improve and I'd have varying levels of consciousness before deteriorating again.  I have very fragmented memories from those weeks but because of the medication and brain injury I was very confused and hallucinating. Those are the times that I was restrained the most and I am left with severe PTSD from. Towards the end of this period I was waking and understanding more and removed from ventilation though still unable to fully understand things or communicate. 
The day the ventilator came out lead to a horrifying 3 days of me lying in bed, unable to communicate how much difficulty I was having to breathe on my own, struggling for each tiny breath and terrified to faIl asleep, believing that I'd be unable to keep myself breathing if I wasn't awake and focusing entirely on each breath. I didn't sleep for 3 days and my heart rate and blood pressure were high from being terrified that I'd die I slept that I had to be sedated again. I'm not sure how long I was back under but the next time I woke I was being taken to a waiting ambulance for transfer to long-term care and then EMT said ""there's a virus killing everyone and you don't even know anything about it"" I was very alarmed lol
I continued to go in and out of consciousness in the new hospital but I had more days awake and was gaining back cognitive function, understanding more and speak some . But I was extremely confused and hallucinating, was telling the nurses a lot of silly stuff that still makes me laugh today. At this point, they tried to remove me from iv fentinyl and I had severe withdrawal which caused me to become unresponsive and unable to speak and didn't understand why the nurse was saying she missed hearing my voice bc I didn't remember her or even myself. Then I had the aneurysm/dissection and went unconscious for around 5 days. I was fully unconscious unable to speak. But when I did finally wake up for good in was fully conscious and could speak , I did not remember any of the stuff that had happened before then or understand where was or how long it'd been.

48,2021-08-29 12:54:07+00:00,"This is gonna be long and detailed. The TLDR short list of it is try these and that allergy testing for medication and filler allergies may help. 

Codeine either in liquid or pill form
Trammadol.
Some countries those 2 are otc.
Injectable low dose oxycodone no extras
2.5mg hydrocodone, morphene, or oxycodone to start
Kratom, Dosage can vary quite a bit person to person. Maybe other natural means listed below. Also doesnt effect most drug testing and totally legal so wont piss off most docs.
Cbd products without thc, highly recommend and passes drug tests easily with minimal breaks before or moderation of use. Doctor approval varies. Same with..
Medical marijuana of different strengths/strains

Ugh ive heard of low dose naloxone being used, the opioid blocker... But i have major doubts to logic and safety. combination with any opioid can kill tolerance. Basically forcing 10mg to do a job 5 would and your body responds like its 10 so self defeating...like most political medical decision making.

Low dose fentanyl has many forms
Low dose buphenorphene without naloxone
Low dose methadone
Those 3 have major risks and can run up tolerance. Anything with naloxone will run up tolerance and negates the effects youre tryin to get from the fkin opioid, avoid. In some they can be used to wean down tolerance but not for all, and thats a problem for someone not on minimal dosing by any means.


Lidocaine/cbd, etc patch form. 


Uh ok im not a doc but have researched like one for half a century and gotten recommendations for med school if i ever am healthy enough again following my injury spiraling..   also you didnt give ant clue to age, weight, underlying conditions, actual diagnosis, area of pain, its intensity, effect on her life, or whats been tried. So going broad.

..Caine... Thats usually anesthetic. Those can be in some forms opium or cocaine based, but i havent seen used in practice in ages in any setting. molecularly similar but can be major differences still. Not typically the same as pain killers. Except for marcaine being almost the same as buphenorphene being an exception there im aware of.  

 Otc meds are not even in the same family either and only mixed with opioids in some forms like norco or Percocet, but not always with hydrocodone or oxycodone. They are good for cases inflammation is an issue short term but otcs can cause irreversible severe even life shortening and threatening damage over long periods or higher doses. If chronic and round the clock pain i recommend not combining anyways and adding if needed for inflammation or an extra bit of relief on bad days. 

She may have luck with codeine cough syrups or straight codeine, thats a place id start if isnt already experienced on them. Least euphoria and easy for adjusting, but likely wont help more than 6 months or a year til her body is tolerant enough for the real thing and to move to 2.5-5mg kid size opioid range on hydrocodone, morphine, or oxycodone. 

  Depending on the results Are these actually allergies, or intolerance, or some autoimmune condition ..which may have been misdiagnosed if shes having that kinda reactions to so many chemicals? Possibly faking or exaggerating for attention even, does happen unfortunately..cause most people in actual states of suffering will eventually seek anything to recover normalcy and get relief. Big difference in decibels condition to condition and person to person as well.

 Could be anxiety because of her poor understanding of pharmacology...? Meaning more info and trials might be significantly improving.  Possibly just so nieve to and sensitive to pain meds that she gets euphoria at low doses and anxious about that and refuses to wait a few weeks for her body to adjust?... (warning though that one could be a sign she would be addiction and self control problem prone after adjustment if she develops a taste for that feeling, the percentage of the population genetically prone get an entirely different sensation in part from from intentionally over using for the biggest high. If a 5mg Norco/morphine/oxy makes someone feel like theyre floating on a magic carpet could be a sign theyre more prone, but so can general sensitivity and lack of experience.) Not sure if they can test for dna addiction proneness yet but can def for poor effect prone that need way higher doses for the same relief. 

 If the case is she just is so sensitive to it then halfing the lowest dose to start then 3/4 a dose if no effect at half could find the happy middle ground where she is functioning without euphoria or anxiety, the euphoria comes with taking too much so generally the pain relief kicks in before that and if youre getting that then you need to decrease slightly til functioning or pain relief is inadequate, youll run up tolerance and addiction potential. Minimal dosing that makes the pain normalized otherwise youre hurting yourself in the long run, that tolerance goes up then its that much harder to get relief. More euphoria bad. few weeks on half dose should help that, if it works stay there til it stops, when that happens creep up til stable again like a quarter dose at a time then stop. 

Once the body adjusts likely will have to go up slightly a couple times but should find a stable dose, best to rotate between two similar but chemically different meds to lessen physical dependence and loss of effectiveness but manny stay on the same dose for years or even decades. Many also cant and various things require many increases especially critical or cancer level care, or those without an enzyme to nake it work well most have.   For me after 2 years hydrocodone didnt give me enough relief to function anymore and after 4 its not even a rotation option. Ive tried several, nearly every option opioid and non opioid. 

Few docs have let me try others but left me too short relief to function by underestimated pain or dosage needs.  Like buphenorphene may have worked... at 3 to 4x the dose given. Hydrocodone maybe at 1.5 or 2x what was given... But because opioids dont work the same in all people and theyre required to follow nonsensical cdc charts now that massively over generalize and are often flat wrong.. well.. another gripe. Woulda been better me rotating 9mg oxy and 15-20 hydrocodone than my oxy tolerance going up to 15 then 25 and not being able to get help at the er anymore but small difference in doctors bias or misconception/assumptions can lead to drastically different outcomes.  Bout to try ketamine maybe if insurance allows, thats a great option if pain pills just dont work. Great for depression and mood as well that is non opioid, done weekly under doc supervision in most cases. 

 misinformation is rampant and even many doctors push it now. 

She may have options.  Norco would be out if otc causes liver, kidney, or allergic symptoms but is unusual to have a full allergy to multiple otc meds without some common ingredient or some underlying or misdiagnosed autoimmune style condition.  If its a filler then maybe liquids would be different, a medication allergies panel with otc pain meds, opioids, and depending on the type you didnt specify could also include muscle relaxers, nerve pain anticonvulsants/Antidepressants, other chemically different opioids, ...or maybe even some natural ones like kratom, wild lettuce, also a type of lotus flower, or have recently been hearing about ghost pipe tincture but havent researched. Isnt my forte though. Im an extreme chronic pain case with necrotic bone and a crushed artery from a surgical error. My experience safer one low dose opioid or a rotation schedule than any combination of multiple drugs and their ridiculous side effects. Doctors now will actually try to convince you pathetic pain relief, forcing you on 3 different thousand dollar a month meds, even risking brain damage, delusions, blackouts, or wanting to kill yourself is better than a 30$a month opioid that has you working full time with maybe some irritability and constipation at times, the irritability usually goes away over time as long as you dont go in withdrawal. Theyll also try to push multiple expensive injections of steroids/lidocaine, often multiple a week.. that rarely help anyone and insurance often wont cover...worsens more than helps imo.  Its better for the doc cause the dea doesnt make them do paperwork or threaten to ruin them over those meds, better for billing insurance and better for their wallets. Opioids work miracles.

since the only hydrocodone without otcs im aware of are higher dosing than opioid nieve need, probably out til been on for years. Dont recommend anyone take long acting especially when its abuse deterrent.. horrible control, horrible absorption, results were exaggerated to get more insurance money cause they pay better for 12 hour pain control than 8. and anything 247 risks running up your tolerance faster just by not having any gaps or taking as a response, becomes addictive on a physical level quicker as well. Better to go as long as possible on 6 hour meds. Keep in mind if its nerve pain, those meds can cause far more harm than good between side effects, poor control, horrid withdrawals worse than opioid, and in my case permanent memory loss, and possibly brain damage having near daily bouts of brain fog and brain zaps when i am falling asleep, others too. 

 Codeine and tramadol is the weakest level, the tram is tech not made from poppies so different mechanisms and maybe more tolerable but also causes more nausea and negative side effects.  Hydrocodone but dealing with the euphoria for a week or two while body adjusts may be preferable to suffering. The euphoria only happens in cases with too much medication or zero tolerance. Like smallest dose of oxycodone made is 5mg...but for my first 6-8 months i was getting mild euphoria and well managed pain at 2.5mg taking half at a time. That could be an option and smoothe the adjustment.",2

I‚Äôve already had Covid. My whole family got it. Most of us were asymptomatic, whereas a couple got pretty sick and one got extremely ill. At the same time, my mother was hospitalized after her second shot because of an adverse reaction. She was thankfully okay, her body just rejected pretty hard. She was out of work for a few days and only kept for observation at the hospital. IN NOT AGAINST VACCINES!!!!  This is just a small example of the types of studies. A lot of these aren‚Äôt peer-reviewed, only because all this research is so new. It‚Äôs the same as vaccine research. Heck, only 1 vaccine has been evaluated and FDA certified and that just happened a few days ago. 

I understand if people want to give me hell, I‚Äôm just a guy over the internet. Please, be more thoughtful and considerate of your friends, family and neighbors who are skeptical of gene therapy. I believe I can safely speak for them when I say we all just want more research before the jab. These gene therapies are the FIRST of their kind, never been used on the public. It‚Äôs all one giant experiment and we all hope it goes fine, it most likely will. 

Lastly, this is the Opiate Reddit forum. Did we all just forget that these pharmaceutical companies flooded the markets with OxyContin and MsContin, spewing lies that its ‚Äúnon addictive‚Äù and a ‚Äúmiracle drug‚Äù with nearly zero percent chance of abuse???  They knew, FOR A FACt that they were poisoning this country, targeting specific spots (like West Virginia) with highly addictive drugs...      But.....  now you trust them?    Seriously????  Now they‚Äôre looking out for our best interest???  All the giant lawsuits, the hundreds of millions of dollars they‚Äôve paid out just this year alone. But now, they want to cure the world?  I call bullshit. It‚Äôs a racket. 

And thank your sister for her part in combatting this thing. (Not being a smart ass)",1

Judge Somer's Order responding to WKHS's statement of violation of Appointments Clause ((https://i.redd.it/4mn9h4zjmlj71.jpg))  Personal Statements:  1) It is evident AC was brought up by WKHS.   2) Defendant(s) attempted to dismiss. Was denied and moved to oral arguments.   3) Speculating here but it is likely apparent the Judge is interested in the plaintiff's motion and is willing to hear both sides. I am assuming you are aware of court procedures but, if not, if a judge is willing to hear the argument it means there is some grounding to the plaintiff's motion.   4) Regarding the OP's post, it is fun to dig into either a) plaintiff's lawyers b) defendants lawyers c) Somer's past proceedings and articles to obtain insight on his perspectives.   ""Why would you think the Judge wants to make a statement?"" - IMO Somers sees a case to the motion of WKHS and open to the argument rather than dismissing. Should be an interesting case study to follow.   ""Why do you think it is unusual for a law student to write such an article for the law review?"" - Speculating here but it appears this Judge abides to the verbiage of the law rather than using it as guidelines to an evolving society.

After a few years, my broker decided to switch to a competitor for online document signatures. I think it was called dotloop? Can't remember. Anyways, it sucked complete ass. Totally not user friendly. Difficult to figure out the steps. Shitty instructions, etc.   Then after a bit of that, I wound up switching brokers. My new broker used yet another competitor which I don't remember the name of at all. This one was the same as before. Hard to use and just a pain in general.   My point being, Docusign had it really figured out, even really early on in the game, too. They are like Facebook in a field of MySpaces and friendsters.

I get very quiet when I'm in pain and the fog of the anesthesia clouded every thought I had. I told my recovery nurse I needed help and after the longest few minutes of my life the doctor arrived to enter fentany first into the computer system and finaly my IV. 

And Holy Jesus it was like a miracle. On top of shutting down the pain completely I felt like every part of my body was back to normal: my speech, my focus, my sitting upright, my ability to have very normal conversations with visiting family and staff with my normal affect.  I'll never forget that sensation of efficiently being returned to myself after such acute misery. It wasn't euphoria exactly, but I was chipper and just plain relieved. The only negative but was that it wore off so quickly and I was switched over to oxycodone tablets. It's a strong drug for sure and I see why people unfortunately get so hooked on it.

81,2021-08-28 04:11:05+00:00,"My mom died from pancreatic cancer. I was 26 and already had a pretty good oxy habit from nabbing a few 40;s every few days out of the cabinet or when id go to fill script.  Not like it really matters but she didn't take them often.  She had morphine that helped her more and a kodine syrup (not lean) she also used more often. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any way after she died i absolutley filled her scrips for the codine bottle, the 50ct 40mg oxy's (yellow ones) the 75 oxy 5's (or maybe it was 10's i really dont remeber) the kadian morphine, the xanax, the clonidine, and some anti nausia stuff i ended up not really liking much.

so that i guess really began my ""real habbit""

During my stuper i found out my moms ex boyfriend who lived in the same park as us had taken all her meds and put them in a bag was saving them? or something. He diddnt use.  I think he just hated the idea of throwing away so much expensive medication.

&amp;#x200B;

and when i say so much i mean....3/4 of a gallon freezer bags of pills.  A good 30-30% of the oxys, morphine AND 10mmg hydros and 10 mg percs from a year or 2 back when my mom was first diagnosed and she wasnt on the heavy shit yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i would take a paper clip and practice on my front door of my trailer.  I learned how to pick it. I broke into that mans house no less than a dozen times over 2 months.  I couldnt take the whole bag, hed know something was up and cops might get involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO i would dump the whole bag (that i found searching his drawers) on his bed an pick out a handfull of the good one. Id just put them in my pockets and go home and get wasted.  I honestly have very few memories of that time.  I inherited and stole what must have been 10's of thousands of dollars of narcotics over about a year and a half period.  I was a full blown junkie and i never really paid for anything.  I did use herioin and methadone and whatever other pills but never consistantly enough to get addicted bad. Not before my mom got cancer. 

&amp;#x200B;

After all those meds ran out i spent about 15K on herion getting middled to death first at 40 a bag + extra then up to 80 a bag.  Was the only way i could score though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually checked myself into suboxone rehab. I also was in school and i went and saw my councler and told them i had a problem .  I think I said my mom died about 2 years ago and ive been using pain meds ever since.

There's hydrocodone it's other metabolite can bind to the mu opioid receptor at high doses. The ceiling effect of codeine levels get to high in the liver and the enzymes can't metabolize it all.

La fel cum unii oameni nu consuma droguri, altii nu se duc la curve, altii nu beau alcool, altii nu fumeaza tigari, dar mereu vor exista unii oameni care vor face lucrurile astea


Da. Unele droguri sunt mult prea periculoase pentru a fi legalizate, dar tot poti face rost de ele asa ca sincer, mi se pare inutil razboiul asta impotriva drogurilor

Razboiul al trebui sa fie impotriva faptelor pe care le faci cat esti sub influenta lor. La fel cum e cu alcoolul de altfel

De asemenea, ideal ar fi sa invatam despre dorguri totul si sa stim ce riscuri ne asumama cand facem ceva. Sa stim ce se intampla la prima doza, sa stim ce e aia dependenta, cum apare, sa intelegem  de ce consumam prima data si de ce consumam a 50a oara, sa stim cum si cat de greu dispare depedenta, sa invatam despre cat rau iti fac cateva doze din anumite droguri intr un timp foarte scurt si nota de plata pentru fiecare drog dupa fiecare doza.

&gt; 1. It‚Äôs a gateway drug

The verdict: False

Marele studiu de pe un cacat de site care probabil si-a luat bani sa impinga legalize agenda... ia sa vedem ce cacat mananca baietii aici.

&gt; Cannabis is often called a ‚Äúgateway drug,‚Äù meaning that using it will probably lead to using other substances, like cocaine or heroin.

corect

&gt; The phrase ‚Äúgateway drug‚Äù was popularized in the 1980s. The whole idea is based on the observation that people who use recreational substances often start by using cannabis.

Din nou corect, nu puteau incepe cu premise gresite pentru ca plm... nu toata lumea e cretina.

&gt; Some suggest that cannabis affects the neural pathways in the brain that causes people to develop a ‚Äútaste‚Äù for drugs.

Si aici incepe mancatoria de cacat. ""Niste"" faimosi necunoscuti si nenumiti au lansat o ipoteza care ridica mingea la fileu celor care spun ca iarba nu e gateway drug. Ipoteza falsa, bineinteles, dar care ajuta cauza ierbivorilor atunci cand o poti discredita drept o teorie gresita.

&gt; There‚Äôs little evidence to back up these claims, though. While many people do use cannabis before using other substances, that alone isn‚Äôt proof that cannabis use caused them to do other drugs.

But of course... SI TOTUSI, gateway drugs nu functioneaza asa, heroina nu te face dependent de cocaina sau de droguri in general. 

Gateway drugs functioneaza la nivel social si ca nivel de accesibilitate. SI aici vin baietii cu ultima fraza din acest capitol... care e incorecta din cauza ca se bazeaza pe o exceptie.

&gt; One idea is that cannabis ‚Äî like alcohol and nicotine ‚Äî is generally easier to access and afford than other substances. So, if someone is going to do them, they‚Äôll probably start with cannabis.

&gt; One studyTrusted Source from 2012 mentions that in Japan, where cannabis isn‚Äôt as accessible as it is in the United States, 83.2 percent of users of recreational substances did not use cannabis first. 

Am mai zis mai demult asta... sa-mi suga pula cei care introduc in discutie exceptii ca sa le iasa lor narativa. Iarba in Japonia este cea mai scumpa din lume si in Japonia politia e politie, drogurile sunt foarte putine iar mentalitatea lor e alta.

And that's where you're wrong, kiddo. Legalizarea drogurilor nu face decat sa ridica pretul prin taxe, samd. Tutunul are accize imense, imagineaza-ti ce adaos se baga la cocaina si iarba. SI aici apar prietenii nostri, traficantii... mai puternici si mai influenti ca oricand.

It's not really common and the way this works, they are not intercepting random packages. Usually they are already on to someone and plan to bust them. Attempting to make the delivery is only about getting more evidence to make sure their charges stick, ie they want to catch them red handed. This usually results in them being able to take down the whole drug ring at once by catching the whole group together and unaware. They are NOT inspecting every package that comes through the station. These are known dealers and criminals being taken in this manner, it's one more part in the evidence chain.

-what type of top surgery is best for you? Keyhole, Double Incision with Free Nipple Grafts, inverted-T, etc

-will you get drains? How do you take care of them? When would you get the drains out and what is that like?

-how soon after the surgery can see your results?

-will they supply you with the compression garmentor do you need to buy your own? And if so, from where?

-what does recovery look like? How long will you have to wear the compression garment? How soon can you shower? How soon can you exercise? Do they recommend anything for recovery, like‚Ä¶ I dunno, dry shampoo, a specific scar reduction cream, a specific lotion for your nipples, ibuprofen, whatever

-what medications will they give you for recovery? What do you need to avoid with those medications? (Like don‚Äôt drink alcohol or take sleeping pills with any opiates, for example)? Do you need to stop testosterone ahead of time? When can you restart testosterone?

Oh and I can tell you from personal experience- if they give you any sort of opiates for pain (t3s, Vicodin, oxycodine, etc) that they‚Äôll constipate you pretty bad (TMI, I know lol). They‚Äôll most likely give you stool softeners to take with them, but those never worked for me (you should still take them!). But if you‚Äôre like me, I recommend Miralax.

Brw, cancer deaths are wuick, but they‚Äôre often very painful‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt mean to tell you what your relatives‚Äô lives were like, I don‚Äôt know, but in general, cancer is not a preferred way to go. It tskes months and often there is a point when MJ and morphene aren‚Äôt working any more. I‚Äôd say a clean stroke at 120 would be my preferred method.

So the next step forward for contemporary medicine is to *prevent* diseases of aging,  to stop CVD, Alzheimer etc *before* the body breaks and we need to just keep it goikg with drugs. 

And that means maintaining the body well during health.

The emerging literature on T points towards it having some negative effects on the cardiovascular system. So I‚Äôm interested in coming together and thinking about ways to help members of this community stay healthier and happier.

On the subject of happier, I must say, after switching over to whole foods, my mental health has improved too. It was so bad I lost my microbiome, got graying hair, woke up in the night, ruminating‚Ä¶ for years until my body started breaking down.

And no wonder. A bad diet (processed+sugar) feeds inflammation which first manifests as depressed mood and then later on as ‚Äùinflammaging‚Äù as the researchers say, which leads to diseases of old age, like T2D, CVD, dementia.

This came from the coroner that checked his body, also finding several other drugs. This was not a hate crime, or racist, but rather manslaughter, covered up and exaggerated by the media.

Opioid cough syrup is like $2000 dollars on the street now where as in the 90s it was $80. now there is much opiate regulation where they really try to avoid giving pain killers despite you being clearly in pain in the emergency room.  ur right all the dope is cut with fentanyl, people know by now that all the pills are all fetanyl.

But the distribution from muscle/fat back into plasma(and later out of the body), is based on the difference between levels (will only leave fat if plasma concentration is below fat concentration), so if continued use is keeping your plasma levels up for some amount of time, you're accumulating fentantl in your fat, and when you stop, this could add days of additional time to the elimination.

Official report says death by heart attack due to high amounts of Fentanal. Look at the actual report not the one they paid for after the fact. Which btw in that area there has been 100s of deaths from Fentanal overdoses during that time and he was a kniwn user so lets not act like its crazy. people who dont want the truth ignore that. Yes there was a fake autopsy by the way. Prob the one most people think is real. It was independently done by Dr.Baden. Bought and paid for. He is out of Chicago and not even the coroner assigned to Floyd. You will see he also did the autopsy for Epstein ruling it a suicide. Weird huh but we will just ignore that... It is the one they used in trial to convict Chauvin and never even presented the official autopsy report. So U look it up and think ahhh case closed just neatly wrapped in a bow but you are wrong. Nope. Really look at the facts. He was yelling he could not breathe for 30 minutes before he was even on the ground if you watch the full videos and was acting erratic and out of control. Why is what led up to the incident conveniently ignored along with his horrible record and the 2nd privately payed for autopsy by a prosecutors coroner for hire from another state?

182,2021-08-24 04:20:29+00:00,"What age did you start substances:  12.  Weed, shrooms &amp; Acid a few lines of UK speed (not meth) &amp; coke.  I got into H when I was 15.

How painful was it stopping:   Once I started using opiates I've never stopped.  There were times I've been in withdrawal through being unable to score for some reason which was always horrible and I tried cold turkeying off methadone a few times which was much worse than H withdrawal and I never got to the end of it.

How do you see your future:  I'll just keep on keeping on I guess and see what happens.  I have chronic pain because of spinal injuries so I'm on morphine for the duration now.  It's affected my mobility quite badly so I'm affected more by boredom, loneliness &amp; depression. 

Do you also use benzos:   I've used them sometimes for taking the edge of withdrawal, never saw any recrational use in them but I was prescribed Valium as a muscle relaxant after I was injuured.  I soon found it screwing with my memory so I've been slowly tapering it. I'm down to 20% of the original dose and this part is worse than the beginning of the taper.  It doesn't mess with my memory any more but it's been the worst drug tapering experience of my life and when I get off this shit I'll never, ever, ever take another benzo again.   Benzos are great for bringing people out of bad shroom/acid trips &amp; panic attacks

And what impact has substances caused on your mental health and your family:    Using opiates helped with depression a fair bit, especially being on MMT and now MS Contin.  When my family found out I was using H there were what I guess are the usual histrionics; there's a strange irony in having your abusers laying blame back at one's own feet.  As far as my own mental health goes, I prefer to numb out the images  &amp; thoughts reverberating from my early life that I still find disturbing and provoke anger in me.  Nothing works as well as junk. I've tried counselling &amp; psychotherpy and all it did for me was give me a mistrust of psychiatrists.

How has COVID impacted ur use:   Definitely wanted to use more during the lockdowns.  It had been many, many years since I last did H but I scored some fairly big amounts earlier this year and got stuck in, no regrets; I enjoyed every minute but decided it wasn't what I wanted for the long-term. I'm getting a bit old for all that.  

Name most of the drugs you have done: Hash, Grass, Shrooms, Acid.  Opiates/oids: Opium, #3 Heroin, pharma Heroin (Diamorphine) Morphine, Dextromoramide (Palfium) Dipipanone (Diconal) Fenanyl patches, Pethidine, Methadone, Omnopon (similar to Pantopon) Dihydrocodeine, Codeine.

I hate uppers but I've tried amphetamine sulphate (meth wasn't a thing in the UKthen ) coke &amp; freebased coke.  There used to be some pills In the UK called 'Durophet M' or 'black bombers' that contained Dexamphetamine, Methampetamine and Methaqualone, I liked those at moderate dosages.  Methaqualone in the UK was dscontinued in 1980, it was called 'Mandrax' a.k.a. 'mandies' or 'randy mandies'; they contained an antihistamine as well as Methaqualone and I liked those while they lasted.

Benzos: Valium, Temazepam, Librium, Oxazepam, Nitrazepam, Chlorazepate, Midazolam, Phenazepam.  I never used benzos recreationally, only as a functional thing.

Barbiturates: Tuinal, Nembutal, Soneryl.  I've never used these recreationally either but Nembutal especially can knock you right out when you're in H withdrawal. 

Are you a polyaddict or one substance:  I suppose so but not by intention.  I've been opiate-dependent for over 40 years but the valium dependency was a result of prescribing from 6 years ago and I'm working on getting rid of that",1
183,2021-08-24 03:38:36+00:00,"Ahhh, i'm wore out.  And people got a lot meaner over the past couple generations.  Everybody hates first, and never second guesses it any more.  I've always been an oddball.  I was a book guy in a teevee world growing up.  Lucky for me, i got my first machine in '81.  Same one Terry Pratchett started with.  If it wasn't for this internetty thing, i'd be about as relevant as a pterodactyl by now.  As it is, i now feel like the last ass munch on the planet who understands how to use the damn thing.  I know a couple coders, self-taught, late 20s and early 30s, that also understand how to use the web to get real information.  Otherwise...

...when i was a neglected kid, my parents got the newspaper delivered.  So starting in 2nd grade, i'd read the whole paper every morning while i drank my coffee (sorry, i never had any positive relationships with other kids, so i just did what i thought everybody else did alone before school.)  Anyway, back then, there were ""real"" newspapers and these things called ""tabloids"" they sold at the supermarket checkout counters.  Tabloids were always touting alien abductions, and Elvis still alive and flipping burgers somewhere.  But there was clear delineation between real and fake.

Now, it seems like nobody knows the difference any more.  I'm sorry, by my age, i'd rather be alone than have to smile vapidly while some tool explains to me how Paul Mcartney died and was replaced by a body double in 1966.  Fuck off with that nonsense, but even that is better than the conversation i can extract from my submoronic neighbors between sessions of selling their sex for fetanyl.

I dunno.  *whine*  not only does it take energy to try to reassimilate, it takes money and socisl skills i lack.  And, as i described my locals, a desire i don't have.  I'm just done with sapient monkeys.  Outside a text box, at least.  For now.

I do miss good drugs, but besides lacking any criminal connection to the black market, it's all dope and meth any more.  Technically, they sell hard around here, but it's junk.  Laughable.  Not only am i not much interested, that shit's out of my tax bracket.  Nobody even makes molly or acid any more.  I haven't seen old school x with mda in decades now.  I give up.

So, yeah.  Change the world and i guess i'll make the effort.  As it, i don't bother.  Yeah, sitting home alone in my mess isn't pleasant, but neither is being attacked by strangers.  Or being videoed every step of any trip outside.  So.  Thanks for the encouraging sentence; you triggered ten 'grafs if self-defeatist whine.  Hope you enjoyed it!",1

health.

Wtf does that even mean? OxyContin

(synthetic heroine for ADD) is FDA approved

and that doesn't effect future health either

then? Cringe.

Illustrious Brock

Bruh Oxy is a pain killer not an adhd

medication and no it doesn't affect future

health when used correctly and taken as

prescribed?

Wake up!

It literally is used for ADHD. Your talking

about oxycodon cuck. Imagine saying

using heroine doesn't affect future

health if used correctly... your vax hit

People always freak out over videos when they have no idea what is really going on.  First, in Kentucky, just as in any state, a judge must order the removal of a child from a parent, and this never happens without evidence being presented.  Neither social workers nor cops can just walk up to a kid and remove it from their parents.  Second, the police being there suggests that either the woman is being charged with an offense that precedes the disorderly charge, or the woman has acted in a threatening manner to others.  Third, given that this is occuring with a newborn in a hospital, it is almost a certainty that the infant tested positive for drugs (all newborns get a drug screen).  Usually in these cases, it's meth, cocaine, or opiates (heroin, fetanyl, oxycontin, etc).  But before removing a child, a positive drug screen of the baby is analyzed by gas chromotography to ensure the drug screen was correct.

The book is not in favor of the war of drugs; one of the more critical characterizations of the protagonist is his early monologue where eschews the script promoting the war one drugs in favor of humanizing drug addicts 

https://youtu.be/holRXdkl00I

I won't argue the cop have go outside the rule of law is a theme of the book. But the story is absolutely not praising cops ubiquitously. The book is not black and white; to suggest Dick would write that simply is missing the mark and unfairly discrediting him. 

I don't know how you can call the conspiracy angle a misstep for blurring the message, as if any compound layering or multiple threads is inherently bad. Moreover, the message isn't cops vs drugs addicts, as you suggest, it's broader than that. It's the general mechanizations surrounding drug, going from the individual human level, all the way to the top financial interests. And it should be noted that Purdue pharma the manufacturer of Oxycontin was actually flirting with the idea of setting up their own rehab clinics for oxcodine addicts.",1

209,2021-08-23 14:08:40+00:00,"i think one of the highly hyporitical moments in sport, at least generally speaking, is the notion that we can still continue seeing athletes bbreaking records after records, relying only on their genetics, better nutrition, equipment and training. i.ex. the swimmer had to use a specific swimmsuit, which got banned a few seasons later, because the people did not like it, as it gave them (all, keep in mind!) a better water resistance.

Nowadays, we like to look at athletese like usain bolt, when he broke the world record, we all said it won¬¥t be broken, but it got broken. when eddie hall deadlfited 500 kg a few years ago, we all thought it would stand for a fe more years, but hafthor bj√∂rnsson broke it.

in fact, we as the spectators, the journalist, the sponsors and the meida in general want more records, but want them ""clean"" without any substances.

the west german team of 1954 was accused of using doping, which would be in the realm of possibilities, as their performances from the group stages until the final got better, not playing wise, but their endurance, speed and recovery got clearly better. the german wehrmacht was one of the leading forces in developing medicine to keep the soldiers being at a alltime high with their fighting capacities, just google pervitin, a mixture of metamphetamine, cocaine and oxycodon. 

the soviets got the know how after ww2 and used it to develope their world class athletes, like the bulgarian (then part of the sovie union) coach ivan abadzhiev, world class coach, managed to coach one of the, if not the best, group of weightlifters in the 80s.

&amp;#x200B;

of course every nation is doping, even at small federations, heck, the only reason weightlifting is still an olympic sport is cause the federations and all the clubs would die (to quote a good friend of my father, who was an elite lifter at the european level and multiple time national champion in weightlifting) if the IOC would ban them because of all the doping.

&amp;#x200B;

and yes, one can also take substances to perform better without visible enchancement of their physical performances, even dart players, archers, gunman, even chess players (some of them) take substances to keep their level of concentration at an all time high.

The extreme majority of the opiate/opiod crisis is about drugs that come into the USA over the Mexican border. It's still an issue in other nations but not the same scale. The press has conflated this with another issue involving Oxycontin.

  
Standard info claims that 10% of the general population misuse drugs. But only 0.18% of addicts get started on pharmaceuticals.  And only 0.2% of pain patients ever have drug issues of that sort. The market for black market pharmaceuticals is real buy tiny and farm more expensive when to compared to the market for street drugs. Yet it is the pain patients who are constantly under the microscope and tormented over a hysterical obsession that is not supported by evidence.  


There is a real oxycotin problem that is not the Opiate Crisis. It is also not the same scale at all.  Some pharmaceutical companies, pharmacy reps and some larger chains of clinics did illegal crap with kickbacks and/or pushing Oxy to people to sell more of it (more sales means more cash). This was not because it was an opiod but because pharmaceutical people do this with all sorts of drugs. Glaxo Smith Klein got fined 3 billion for doing it with other medications like antidepressants. That is not the opiate crisis. They got caught at it partly because the industry is heavily tracked and regulated due to the war on drugs. The companies have to watch every pill and reduce their opiate manufacturing and sales quantities every single year regardless of the level of real need.

 Deja fugeam de orientarea mea sexuala de ~8 ani. In vara aceea cazusem intr-o spirala de consum de alcool si droguri la greu(de toate doar heroina si psihedelice nu). Consumam si inainte, dar nu atat de des. In timpul saptamanii de obicei consumam alcool si weed si in weekend chestii mai hard+alcool si weed.  Mergeam cam la 3 saptamani la vreun festival de tehno si in weekend-urile obisnuite la party-uri tehno.

 Starea de ebrietate a ajuns plasa mea de siguranta deoarece ma disociam de realitate si pe moment uitam ca sun ""ghei dƒÉla"".  Eram un party animal adevarat. Dar in realitate ma facea sa ma simt si mai mizerabil, mai ales zilele care urmau dupa consum de din-astea mai hard.

Parintii mei nu banuiau nimic pentru ca acasa doar dormeam. Prietenii din nou nu stiau cum ma simt pentru ca deja aveam reputatia asta de party animal si ei credeau ca asa ma distrez eu. Ma rog, chiar ma distram pe moment:))

Cel mai low moment din vara aia a fost dupa o seara de mers cu cortul. Am baut atat de mult incat am avut black-out total de la 11 seara pana m-am trezit. Aveam black-out destul de des, dar niciodata asa interval mare.  Urmatoarea zi m-am trezit cu un sentiment de vina imens. Aveam impresia ca le-am spus tuturor cine sunt cu adevarat. Toata lumea imi spunea cat de beat am fost in seara aceea si ca nu ma puteam opri din vorbit. 

Am avut noroc ca ai mei erau in concediu si eram singur acasa. O saptmana am fost in stare de soc, nici nu ma puteam uita in oglinda de rusine ca as fi recunoscut ca sunt omosexual. Doua zile nu am iesit din camera, nici din pat nu m-am ridicat. Am stat sub plapuma si ii intrebam pe toti ce am vorbit atatea ore. Nimeni nu zicea nimic concret si eu credeam ca nu vor sa imi spuna ca le-am zis de mine. Cand am inceput sa ies din nou cu oamenii interpretam fiecare vorba, fiecare gest, fiecare privire. Aveam impresia ca toata lumea stie. A fost cea mai oribila saptamana din viata mea. Incepusem sa caut in disperare metode de conversie a orientarii sexuale, sfaturi cum sa fii mascul alpha, cum sa cuceresti fete etc.

Cumva am supravietuit saptamanii si am revenit la vechiurile obiceiuri pana am inceput facultatea. Spre surprinderea mea nu am continuat sa consum in fiecare  zi in timpul facultatii si chestii mai hard doar o data sau de 2 ori pe luna.",22

&amp;#x200B;

here a snippet from one of the studies

&amp;#x200B;

The largest review of paracetamol for pain relief, led by University of Sydney, Australia, has found only four conditions where it was shown to relieve pain and confirmed paracetamol was ineffective for low back pain despite its common use.  
  
Key findings:  
  
Paracetamol only had evidence of effectiveness as a pain reliever for four conditions studied: knee or hip osteoarthritis; (general, not migrane) tension headache; perineal pain after childbirth (between the anus and genital area); and craniotomy (removal of part of the skull); the effect for these conditions was modest.  
The evidence for lower back pain is that it provides no better outcomes than placebo; however, the healing effect of time could be mistaken for medicine efficacy.  
For the remaining conditions e.g. abdominal pain, pain during dental procedures, migraines and middle ear infection, it was unclear whether paracetamol relieved pain.  
Most studies that have been done to date were just for single-dose (taken on one occasion only i.e 1-2 tablets), whereas paracetamol is commonly taken more than once to treat a symptom.  
‚ÄúThis review for the first time brings together all the existing evidence about the efficacy of paracetamol to treat pain in one document,‚Äù said Dr Abdel Shaheed, from the School of Public Health.   
  
Dr Abdel Shaheed concluded that people should not be relying on pain medicines as a standalone treatment for pain relief.",1

Your daughter must be extremely emotionally mature and self confident to turn a negative into a positive. I envy her. Your absolutely correct about my father, in fact your wording of phrases made me think it was him talking to me, even if for only a moment. My mother died unexpectedly when I was 16, and antidepressants were given to me before other options were tried. Unknowingly at that time, I taught myself that if I didn't like the way I felt, I could simply take a pill (or substance) to change the way I was feeling. This as you can imagine led me down a dark road, especially when as an undergrad having a cash only ""walk in clinic"" on the corner of my apt. during oxycotins peak in the U.S. While I have managed to be clean for the most part, depression has always brought me to such despair, that using appeared to be the only way out. Through years of counseling, I'm slowly slowly learning to control my own thinking through mindfulness. But, due to the ""poop out"" of all antidepressants which make them no longer effective, I was told in order to be prescribed a new, different antidepressant, I'd have to get off the horribly evil SNRI drug known as Effexor after taking its max dose for 20 years. Although my father and I attempted this slowly, coming down from 300 to 140, while also weaning off of a 4mg xanax prescription, I relapsed. And I think I may have messed up my years of sobriety and my relationship with my only parent bc of this relapse. I had no idea that SNRI discontinuation syndrome and withdrawal was worse than benzo or even h withdrawl, but it was. And I made the decision to pick up. And I don't know what to do.  My dad is and always has been 100% selfless, as he grew up in poverty, but become well off financially. He repeatedly tells me how much I mean to him and used to tell me how proud of me he was but those days are gone now. I'm sorry for my rant as I know your not able to fix my problems, only I Can.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

331,2021-08-19 04:54:10+00:00,"I had a similar situation 

To preface this story I should let you know that I have tourettes (the physical tick kind)

So where I grew up is a town well known around my province for being a super druggy city. Almost everyone who grows up there gets into some kind of substance as there's nothing else to do. For some people you become a pot head and maybe do some psychedelics in highschool then grow out of it and hopefully lesve the city. For alot of others you get deeper into drugs.

This story takes place in highschool pretty close to my peak drug days. I had only been into weed and shrooms but the people around me were going deeper into stuff like pills. I was pretty adamant to not get into that kind of stuff, partially because I've seen what that stuff can do first hand through a family member who got on meth and ruined his life within months. And partially because this town was suoernsketchy snd most the time the pills you buy aren't what the dealer claims they are (I had friends buy ""molly"" that ended up being a cocktail of stuff like fetanyl, meth, etc)

But of course with all your friends doing this stuff it becomes abit tempting snd is in your mind.

Anyway now to the main story 

I was working at McDonald's. I had worked in the downtown McDonald's which was where most the addicts would go. I was working the closing shift and handing out order up front. When I called out an order a man walked up. Obviously he was into drugs to some capacity. You could just kinda tell by looking at him. 
One thing I noticed immediately was he had the same type of physical ticks that I had from tourettes 

When he walks up to me he says ""do you play guitar?"". I say ""yeah how did you know?""

And he just says something along the lines of 

""Keep doing it, you'll do well"" and smiled and walked off.

I know that doesn't seem to odd. 

But I had just started playing guitar seriously within that year but wasn't taking it serious enough to write songs or anything. I always just say I'd do it then procrastinate about it and smoke weed instead. But that interaction really got me to start working harder on it.

 I started recording stuff, through that I got really close with my friend Sam, I enjoyed hanging out with sam alot more because he was showing me a whole new world of music. ANd how to make music. Eventually I stopped hanging out with my druggie friends and started spending more time with him. Which eventually got me into releasing music, which eventually got me into recording school and let me move out of that town and go to a bigger city.

(Near the end of highschool till early college weed had really tsken over my life. I'm one of those people who experience psychosis cause of weed because of diagnosed mental illnesses I have. It was getting really bad to the point where I was literally hearing voices, become mentally detached from reality and constantly had panic attacks over nothing. But I was so addicted to weed it didn't matter how bad it got I couldn't stop smoking )

Once I moved away from that town for college I became so dedicated to music that I quit smoking and other drugs all together. I had some bumps in the road but in general have stayed off and been really productive. After graduating college me and Sam were able to move to our dream city right downtown when we were only 19. And after quitting weed I started treating music as a full time job and got way better. And eventually led me into new forms of music, and film scoring, and so much other stuff. I'm at the point where I'm confident that within the next few years I'll be able to make a living off the arts full time.

I know that I went really I depth there. But my point, and to tie back to your story is this.

Idk who that guy was at McDonald's but the whole situation had a weird supernatural feeling to it. And the fact he had the same ticks as me and everything. It almost feels like it was a version of myself from another universe coming to stop stop from making bad decisions that would lead me down the wrong path. I honestly belive that that interaction was one of the building blocks that set me up to get to this life I'm living now

I look into the past alot, and realize how many specific things have happend that seemed like they were bad situations, that directly go me to where I am today",24

So just some background info: basically I have a childhood friend who is younger than me and he basically went down the wrong path before I did. Long story short we came across each other on the train and ever since he's helped us get whatever we r looking for like seriously. Anyway we were in Snapchat looking thru connections to find xanax because for some reason every year we crave xans it's basically our addiction and drug of choice. But I guess these devils r getting super popular to pill poppers cuz it seems like no one  has xans wen we actually want them!! But they advertise these as ""percs"" and wen u look that up it says it's a mix of oxycodone/oxycotin so we bought some..... We basically went a good 2 weeks straight popping them and it was fine withdrawals weren't bad, we didn't crave anything, we were able to work without taking one before our shift and we didn't know it was fentynal till I bought them from my old friend and he came out and offered to smoke them??? That's wen it clicked these aren't just a pill. I literally am just a pill popper I didnt wanna fuck with opiates I just wanted Xanax to calm my anxiety with work and just I know how to handle Xanax. 

A few days later I had a day off and I was just starting my day out normal but I didn't take a ""perc"" cuz I didn't crave one I mentally didn't even think about taking it cuz I was t in a mood to get high but later that day I got the worst nausea like seriously I wanted to throw up and I was forcing myself to throw up I felt so off and it was so hot out I had to lay in the shade and I had no idea it was withdrawals!! Like I was so confused about being sick because I've never had my body react this negative to not taking a pill and trying to just have a normal day so a few days later I couldn't handle the feeling. I had to work and I questioned if taking a pill would make me feel better so I did and I immediately thru up and felt better outa no where and I just remember being pissed and realizing ""wtf is that pill, wtf am I buying and will I be ok I don't wanna be addicted to this"" so me and my bf talked cuz we relised how bad this shit was affecting our daily life like  unable to work due to being nauseous no matter wat we did. We looked it up and wanted to cry because there FENTANYL LACED. THERE STREET PRESSED. basically we just bought one more batch and tapered off for about a week and work gave us the news about us being fired basically. Then we tried to cold turkey it but just it wasn't going to work. We couldn't sleep for days. Constant twitches, cramping, crawling, just unbearable pain. We bought so much supplements, CBD edibles and just alot if stuff to possibly just help this pain. long story short we saw that muscle relaxers could help with the pain. Yes we literally were in so much pain we asked our dealer for gabapentin but he said only thing he has similar to help is Xanax.... Since I'm a addict with Xanax I caved in. I WANTED THIS PAIN TO BE OVER. wen ur in a relationship withdrawaling is horrible and I wanted both of us to be better. Anyway after 2 weeks of buying Xanax. I don't remember what happened all I know is that I was able to sleep a decent amount. Pain was bearable and that's y I was scared wen I ran out of Xanax..

Wen we ran out I was scared. I was scared of the pain of the fentynal withdrawals creeping back. I didn't realize I've been blacked out for 2 weeks (I bought a roll of xans and it somehow lasted only 2 weeks!!) So I didn't realize the fentynal would've been out of my system so now I only have to deal with Xanax withdrawals (which I'm use to and would prefer) but I was so stupid my bf went on the street with his mom (sounds super weird but my bfs mom is a drug addict that is addicted to meth and some other stuff) and wen they came back with no xans I got super self centered and just scared, tired and disappointed how no one had xans his mom basically looked at him and said ""can I give her that thing that'll make her sleep"" and my bf was like half awake and just mumbled ""I just wanna sleep"" and she I guess took that as a yes ???? Anyway she came back and told me to drink something and I did long story short I went out to see why I keep hearing falling and she's on the floor passed out like a zombie and in the bathroom is this clear gooey shit. I basically looked it up and it was the liquid doctors use to make patients go to sleep before surgery. But the fact she was able to buy trailer made tranquilizers on the street SCARED ME and the withdrawals from the Xanax was kicking in. I was also drowsy and kinda weird feeling from the shit I was given. 

Imagine being in so much pain from fentynal withdrawals and only thing u think helps is Xanax and since no one was able to find it for u and no one u knew had it that it day and u get told to drink something that'll make u fall asleep but u don't fall asleep for some reason and u go out in the living room seeing someone slumped with the glass u just drank from and u just see a bottle of clear goo. Basically I waited an hour to see if I could sleep but I guess the doseage I got wasn't enough for me to sleep it was just enough to make me drowsy. But it's a weird drowsy cuz like ur entire body is numb and tingly yet the xan withdrawals were making my anxiety so bad I was shaking. After that we decided to just stay sober and only smoke weed. Withdrawals from the Xanax was bad since I was taking so much to numb the fentynal withdrawals. Luckily the fentynal withdrawals r gone and I can happily say I'm 3 weeks sober from those devil's and 5 days clean from xanax although the withdrawals for the first 3 days were SO intense my bf wanted to take me to the hospital because wen I told him his mom gave me that goo stuff he was scared cuz he told me how it's basically a horse tranquilizer and he thought that's y my body was reacting how it was. But I think it was the heat and not eating alot while high af cuz we lost so much weight. The first 2 days I was literally passing out, throwing up foam and shitting water.  I keep saying I'm use to Xanax withdrawals but I never did a roll in a week and a half-2 weeks then cold turkey was really rough but all I can say I'm happy my dealers haven't texted me back since I texted them that one day begging for xans I'm glad no one answered me. Everything happens for a reason and it was to teach me I'm better off sober. Things r looking up annd I'm cutting the story short cuz it's all I remember and I typed alot just now",2
339,2021-08-18 23:32:01+00:00,"Thanks for this. My doctor is definitely pretty prejudiced about prescribing me medications for my pain, and usually uses me being 21 as his reasoning.

Finally finding something that works and being told I can only take 2 or 3 in the span of a 3 week period was super frustrating and he has basically said I‚Äôm not allowed to take them unless I‚Äôm having a ‚Äòbad day‚Äô.

Not only did they lie about how addictive their drug was, but they pushed doctors (whom they lied to as well) to heavily prescribe them to any and everyone. With a massive and one of the biggest advertising campaigns for pharma ever. Along with giving said doctors financial incentives and bonus for the more they prescribed. These drugs were not only harmful to the people who were already ‚Äúdruggies‚Äù but created an entire generation of drug users who unknowingly became addicted to something that was pushed as non addictive. 

Most people trust and do what their doctors tell them, the doctors were led and shown test studies that were basically flat out lies about how addictive it was‚Ä¶and when doctors found out that it was a lie and their patients began dying in waves some were so emotionally destroyed by what they had unknowingly done to their patients yet had no idea how to fix it or the toll it took on them personally. At the same time some doctors were so persuaded by the financial incentives that their greed was too much to stop.

The makers of OxyCotin not only profited massively off creating an entire generation of physically dependent zombies. Lied and deceived tons of doctors and patients alike, but have the blood and deaths of millions of people on their hands not to mention the people who struggle with an addiction they might would have never had.

They might of been hailed as saints for creating a drug that can benefit so many people who live in constant pain, the issue was the lies, that deceived millions and millions of people while making them billions‚Ä¶

You should take the time and watch the company‚Äôs original advertising tape. It includes 7 or so people who were living in pain and could barely function until they were given OxyCotin. They praise the wonder drug and how they are able to live life again. However a few years later when someone went to check-in and see how these people were doing, I believe literally every single one had developed a severe addiction with the majority dying in one way or another from overdose, crashing their car from nodding out, and the destruction of their personalities their lives and their families. None of whom were drug addicts prior, but were your average blue and white collar working family having Americans. 

The Sackler family committed murder, mass murder. Lied and destroyed a generation of young adults and older people, and it continues to destroy and affect people today. They are the single biggest contributor to the opioid crisis we face now‚Ä¶and have made billions of dollars from it showing little to no remorse. They should and will go down as some of the worst selfish greedy people history. Fuck them, fuck everything they stand for all of their money should be taken and distributed to states and directly attributed to rehabilitation. Along with paying funeral cost, and reimbursing anyones who became addicted to drugs through OxyCotin. They should be jailed for the rest of their lives for mass murder as well‚Ä¶and yes it was premeditated murder, because they knew how addictive and dangerous their products were and hid that for as long as they possible could.

To be frank, you're delusional if you think what the officers did was correct. Using the literal video showcasing the event, the police officers are all restricting oxygen to him the entire time by kneeing / physically restricting his neck, chest, legs, and arms. He's literally kneeling on his neck (again, on camera) so don't act like they're helping him. Hell, the court case explains all of this easily. They caused his death, open and shut case. Also, to fix a few of your points: He stated that he was going to lie down, not that he requested it (he was barely ever in the cop car). They then ignored his pleas that he couldn't breath due to THEM restricting his breathing. Wow, such great help by them!

Also, it's already been disproven multiple times that there wasn't enough fetanyl in his body to be the cause of death. There are countless articles and medical professionals who all agree to this point. I'm not going to touch on this since it takes 1 second of research to disprove your weird narrative.

I'm all for holding people accountable...however, you first have to define who the exact perpetrator is.   I'm all for holding the Federal Agriculture industry responsible for giving billions in farm welfare to farmers growing soybeans for China, for instance, rather than growing produce for kids in the inner cities.  I'm all for multi-billion dollar lawsuits for the makers of tobacco products and oxycotin, fentanyl, etc....

407,2021-08-15 19:20:42+00:00,"So-called, ""gender differences"", is just because there are hormonal and physical differences between men and women, combined with the fact most men will generally try to appeal to women, and most women will generally try to appeal to men. It's ridiculous to pretend the physical differences between men and women will not affect how they act.

Sexual assault is something I have never worried about in my life, and assault is something I rarely have a serious worry about, whereas women have to constantly worry about being sexually assaulted. Rape is another thing I will likely never have to worry about. Women generally can't be that scary, and don't sound or look intimidating at all, whereas men can easily be intimidating. logically, men will use strength and intimidation more often than women will, and be more likely to do activities requiring strength. As a man, I also learn I can just gain strength, act dominant, scream, speak in a deep voice, and people will bother me much less. Aggression and intimidation only works in a woman's advantage when men are socially conditioned not to be aggressive back. This, combined with hormones, means men will be more aggressive. Women are generally attracted to strength because strength is sexually dimorphic trait, further encouraging men to look and act strong. Testosterone encourages risk-taking behavior and increases the weight of reward relative to punishment. Being turned on is also a fact of being around a woman for me, whereas I'm pretty sure women don't get turned on by looking at men, and have to be, ""in the mood"". Therefore, logically, most men will also behave more sexually than most women.

Whereas cuteness appeals to men, so women are even less likely to act threatening. This goes along with the fact women are physically cuter, neoteny. The fact women have visible signs of nurturing and feeding babies on them means a connection between womanhood and nurturing will be common. Mothers also have to carry children for 9 months, men do not. A mother has invested her resources into her child and had her child constantly inside her for months before she even gives birth, then continues to feed the child from her own body for months after that, receiving oxycotin bursts every time she breast feeds. Men never have those physical connections. (Also, baby female chimps treat sticks as dolls, so there is also obviously a deeper basis for that.)

Logically, female children will copy their mothers, and want to be like them, and male children will copy their fathers, and want to be like them. This, combined with the fact males are more sensitive to testosterone, and females are more sensitive to estrogen.

It's ridiculous to pretend every difference between men and women is cultural, and pretend those which are cultural are completely unrelated to the physical differences between men and women.

But no, I have to go along with what you believe, how you want me to see the world, despite the fact it makes no sense to me. I can't even debate, I will never have the chance to give any points, and I can't disagree with you, you have to be right.",1

415,2021-08-15 07:51:03+00:00,"Truly empathize with you. Not only because I have hEDS but because before medical school I worked as a pharmacy technician. Not even close to the training involved but to give you an idea, working with a pharmacist was like what a CNA or even an RN is like working with a physician. So I handled many chronic pain cases as far as the patient contact part goes.

My best advice to you is to tell your prescribing physician that you understand the seriousness of addiction and that you are willing to compromise. Tell them you would like a higher oxy to Tylenol script to prove that you do not wish to overdose or risk addiction. 

Oxcodone (brand name OxyContin‚Äîrarely avaible due to Purdue Pharma‚Äôs bankruptcy) is easily overdosable and easily abused and more likely to lead to addiction.

Percocet, is part oxycodone and part acetaminophen (Tylenol). It is much harder to overdose or even abuse Percocet because it contains Tylenol which (if taken too much) will reak havoc on your liver and make you sick before you even have enough oxycodone to satiate the pain. (That is if you don‚Äôt have a high enough oxy ratio.)

Every doctor thinks about opioids differently. But I believe if you have this conversation about higher doses of oxy in Percocet, instead of the oxycodone script, you can get better pain relief.

Not medical advice at all, just the same information a drug commercial would provide. ‚ÄúTalk to your doctor about blah, blah, blah, etc.‚Äù

This goes for everyone when I say, don‚Äôt be afraid to make suggestions to your doctor. You have to be careful because you don‚Äôt want to appear like your google search is more important than their medical degree, but ask them in the form of a question. 

ie: ‚ÄúDr. McDreamy, I heard about this treatment, what‚Äôs your opinion? Could this work in my case?‚Äù

Just know and expect that the doctor‚Äôs say is final. Don‚Äôt argue, but feel free to have a two-sided conversation and make suggestions. Not enough people have this type of healthy dialogue with their doctor. Don‚Äôt be afraid to tell your doctor you‚Äôre in pain but that you want their help to relieve that pain in the safest and healthy way possible.

420,2021-08-15 01:19:03+00:00,"&gt;the issue is she claims to be trans while doing so

Elaborate. Who gets hurt when a trans man wears a dress? You know there are perfectly cis dudes who wear dresses too, right? They're called drag queens. It's an entire thing. (I imagine they also enjoy the validation of being called pretty). 

&gt;you're not nonbinary, transgender, etc. There's no need to latch on to a lable.

See this I think is the root of the issue. There are ABSOLUTELY nonbinary and transgender people out there. They tend to be normal, functioning people exactly like you and me. And it's not just a label to them, either. It's literally life or death.

Now I'm gonna clear up some of the misconceptions I see baked into this comment before telling you why this really matters to me.

&gt;if somebody experiences gender dysphoria why would they make extra effort not to pass?

Because a lot of trans people are highly insecure about making the leap between presenting as their biological gender to presenting as their preferred gender. I mean, can you blame them? There's entire subreddits dedicated to making fun of people who make that decision. 

It goes beyond that of course, especially if they are a minor with parents who might have views closer to yours than mine, but we don't need to get too depressing yet.

&gt;it's such a joke when the only thing you have to do to be accepted is insist on being called a different pronoun that you physically do not match up to

Why? If the goal is maximizing human happiness (which it absolutely should be when talking about identity), why do you think people need to prove themselves in order to be accepted? Can't we just let people be who they want to be? (And no I do not think this applies to age or any other strawman you want to throw at me)

&gt;[trans people] are pressured by the community and enabled by medical professionals

This is not a thing. There are people out there who think that the only way to be a true trans person is to medically transition, and they are called transmedicalists. They are generally hated by the broader trans community and they really don't have much of a presence anymore, online or off. I see posts on trans subreddits reassuring people that they are still valid no matter what steps they do or don't choose to take.

&gt;they risk prolonged unhappiness and anguish after they change their mind

[Wouldn't want that now, would we?](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255)

&gt;maybe there's no ""test"" and that's unfortunate 

This is how I know that you've done zero research while forming your opinions on this topic (no offense). No, the vast majority of doctors will diligently test you and make absolutely sure that treatment is right for you before giving it to you(I've heard of a couple that are a little more lax, but I've yet to hear of any horror stories about them). This isn't Oxycotin, they don't get kickbacks from HRT prescriptions. 

This isn't to say that detransition doesn't happen, because it does. It's just not as big of a problem as you've been led to believe and it's usually for different reasons than one would imagine.

What I meant was that there is no such thing as a trans person transitioning 'too little' or 'not doing enough.' Transitioning is a very personalized thing, and it does nobody any good to belittle people for their transition choices.

Now I'm gonna tell you why I care so much.

I don't know who you are or where you're from. All I know about you is that 1. You exist in the world, 2. You hold anti-trans beliefs, and 3. There is a chance you have a kid/will have a kid someday.

If you do ever have a kid, there is a roughly 2% chance that child will be transgender. If you do ever get that cosmic dice roll, that child's entire life will be determined by your attitudes towards them as a parent. If you try to stop them from being who they want to be, they will be *dramatically* more likely to turn to substance abuse, self harm and eventually, suicide. And it won't be on their teacher who told them trans people exist, it won't be on the trans community, it won't be on anybody but you.

That kid is worth me trying to change minds on the internet, and they're worth you opening your mind a little to the other side of this issue.",0

E quando era eu ao volante e reparava que as pessoas iam fazer merda s√≥ acentuava √† situa√ß√£o. Por exemplo se reparasse que um gajo se ia a meter na rotunda √† minha frente ou que um gajo ia cotornar a rotunda toda por fora, o instinto era continuar na minha vida at√© ao ponto de ser quase uma ""close call"" e buzinar-lhe e depois sentia-me um heroi porque tinha evitado um acidente que simplesmente N√ÉO EXISTIRIA se eu baixasse um pouco o ego e abrandasse logo. E ainda hoje existe esse instinto e durante os √∫ltimos anos tenho tentado detect√°-lo e lutar contra ele.

E trago isso √† discuss√£o porque sempre que algu√©m se mete a discutir o facto da maioria das pessoas n√£o saber fazer rotunda, porque pela minha experi√™ncia pessoal e da gente que conhe√ßo, toda a gente que se queixa disso conduz como eu conduzia e como ando a aprender a n√£o conduzir.

Yet, we still used opium. In comes Bayer, who had scientists engineer raw opium into ""heroin"" (which is a brand name of bayers refined opium) and it's derivatives, oxycodon, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, diacetylmorphine, etc. Given the way our brains function and operate, opium has always been a necessity for pain, numbing of feelings, etc. Bayer took this and ran with it.

Call out to my wife who's utterly bemused. Pain slowly fades over an hour. Get back to sleep. A couple of months of maybe one attack a week as the stone presumably shifted around. Dr's ultrasounded and CT scanned for it but couldn't see it so presumably 'only' a small one. Sent away with Oromorph (amazing stuff. I get opiate addiction) which I could take when it hit hard. Had a tendency to do so in meetings at work. 6 Week later there's a musical tinkle in the toilet.... Assuming it was a small one... FUCK kidney stones. Your kidney should never feel like that.",2

I was 24 at the time which is quite late to have them removed, and I only got them out because I could feel them poking through my gums and they were starting to move my other teeth.

We did the bottoms first. Apparently my dentist office doesn't put you under for this procedure, fucking news to me. On the day of surgery I brought sunglasses and headphones so that I don't have to see or hear any part of the procedure. It should be quick enough right? Wrong.

I am fully conscious. They inject the novicaine, ready to go. He starts on the right side. ""STOP I CAN FEEL IT."" I can feel him cutting into my fucking mouth. We stop and he injects more. Starts again. Nope, can still feel it. Stops AGAIN and injects more. This happened 3x on the other side mind you. 5 times in total. That was the day I learned I am resistant to numbing agents and need more than the average person.

A bit of time goes by and the headphones are doing nothing to drown out the sounds of bone cutting. At one point I open my eyes - BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. When I look up, the Dr is wearing goggles which are reflecting into my mouth, so for a brief moment I saw the absolute massacre going on inside my mouth. Scarred for life dude.

But it gets worse.

I leave surgery like 2 hours later. Conscious fucking surgery. Never again. I go home, I'm prescribed oxycodine and can have one every 6 hours. I'm told to change my gauze every day also and to swish my mouth. The first 2 days are a blur of just sleeping and waking up long enough to take my meds so that I can sleep. The pain woke me up around the 4 hour mark each time though, it was hard to not take them sooner.

3rd day rolls around and I feel awful. Can barely open mu mouth. I have a fever. My face hurts, my jaw is throbbing, the inside of my mouth is hot and I feel like throwing up. I try to change the gauze but can't open my mouth enough to get in there. I'm out of pills also. I walk myself to the dentist (I was single and living alone) and tell them what's going on.

Its not too apparent yet but I'm 25 and its only going to show more as I age. Its a new thing I've noticed too so I'm pretty insecure about it and I'm constantly debating whether I should even look up getting botox or just let myself age.

I look pretty young for my age to begin with and most people think I'm still in high school or college, but every time I look in the mirror all I can see is that one damn line and its really hard for me to accept.

I'm trying to accept it and cope with it because its something literally every single person on earth deals with, but I just wish it wasn't there some days.

The 2 weeks that followed was also extremely painful, due to the gas they pump into your abdomen to do the scopes. If you get up you feel the gas moving up between your organs, pushing into your shoulders, and if you lie down it sort of trickles between your organs again, pushing into your ribs. 

2.Another time I had a ganglion cyst removed. They cut away quite a lot of the tendon to get rid of the cyst. Waking up in the recovery room, same thing: Screaming in pain, begging to get killed. The nurses tell me there's no way I can feel pain as they gave me a painblocker. 

Went to a doctor the next day. Got prescribed a morphene injection and opioids to take home. Slept about an hour from the meds until the pain woke me again. 

Desperate, I return to the specialist who operated on my hand, and well...the shock on his face when realizing how tight the nurses bandaged my hand up.

&gt;Tomorrow is the 7th anniversary of Michael Brown getting justifiably shot dead while charging a lone White policeman in Ferguson, Missouri. Only moments before, him and his homie (a crazy nigger named Dorian Johnson) tried to reach into the squad car and grab the officer's firearm. When the gun went off, the two tried to flee. But Brown soon turned back around and angrily charged the officer. Question: If you had a 6'4"", 300lb Jig running at you full tilt gonzo, wouldn't you have fired? Especially after the two Jigs just tried to steal your gun? Of course you would shoot him. One of the rounds went in thru the top of Brown's head, proving he was running at him head down. The White cop was simply responding to a report of someone roughing up a convenience store clerk to steal a large box of Swisher Sweets (a cheap smelly cigarillo Niggers love). Notice how the traitorous, backstabbing lefty media said little about the role of Dorian Johnson, nor showed him talking on air (the guy was totally wacked). They purposefully let the American public think Brown was just another poor innocent black kid, wrongly killed by a racist White cop. The US media has always been totally flocked up when it comes to jacking the homies. They do it all the time.

#*Pressed pill inquiries are not permitted under any circumstances.*

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

In the video you linked, an two officers test a drug over the period of 40 minutes. Once confirming that it's Fetanyl, a new officer has a panic attack (believing he will die because he's breathing in the fetanyl particles) and passes out. His partner thinks he's overdosing and administers a drug that counteracts fetanyl reactions.

The agency then makes a short video about the event unaware that the officer had a panic attack and not an overdose.

The video is not fake, but it is false that he overdosed.",52

I have had LS since I was a child as well. It sucks, and took many years to actually get a proper diagnosis (I'm talking early 20s). Your daughter will thank you for the early diagnosis someday! I too, also have other autoimmune diseases ( Morphea scleroderma, and reynauds), and I do believe it's all related. 
My best piece of advice is to educate her about LS as best you can. Let her know that with proper maintenance, she can live with this. Someday, it will become nothing but a minor nuisance. Yes, I'm serious! I do have flare ups that do keep me up at night, but only when I get lazy with the steroid maintenance. 

I have a very normal sex life, and have birthed two beautiful, healthy babies :) please stay positive for your daughter. If she senses your fear or worries, it will weigh on her. Being a girl is hard enough. I absolutely understand and feel her pain, and as a mom - I feel your pain too. You're doing the right thing and have taken all the right steps.

1. Chris searched for ""80mg of oxycodon will"" on google on his phone. (Discivery page 1769, pdf page 1587.) This search was deleted, and while the investigators recovered the search, they don't have a date or time for it. So we can't say exactly when he searched this.

2. Shanann exhibited signs consistent with oxycodone overdose the first night when CW arrived in North Carolina. She told her friends that she felt nauseous, lightheaded, that she vomited, that her body was numb/tingly, that she randomly started itching all over, and she got a massive migraine out of nowhere 30 minutes after vomiting. The next morning she vomited again, was still feeling lightheaded, shaky, exhausted, and had blurry vision. Her migraine was still as strong in the morning as it had been the night before despite taking medication for it.

So it is very likely that CW gave her 80mg of oxycodone the day that he arrived in North Carolina. Although it should be noted here that oxycodone doesn't cause miscarriage. Some people have speculated that it was oxytocin (a drug that would likely cause a miscarriage), not oxycodone - but this makes no sense. Shanann didn't exhibit any symptoms associated with oxytocin, and 80mg is not a dosage used for oxytocin anywhere.",1

It seemes like you described sideeffects from oxycodon aka percocet.

From what I read, you are likely to have experienced ortostatic hypotension (the beeing white as shit thing while standing), convulsions, and vomiting plus diarrhea. 

With the exception of the hypotension and convulsions all sideeffects are moderatly likely (aka 1 in 10 patients of clinical and proper administration).
The other two are less than 1 in 100 patients.

Because of your waaaay faster absorption of oxycodon you are more likely to experience sideeffects (increase of dosage to increase of (side-) effects).

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

It's interesting that they now say there was an arrestee who also experienced a medical incident - I wondered about that because it was a messy scene and, if the scene was so toxic, presumably there would be some people or at least raccoons who had already ODed by the time they got there. 

I also wonder if the hospital ran a tox screen knowing that an OD in this situation would be highly unlikely and just wanting it on the record. The deputy is on camera saying he overdosed, so I am guessing there was no tox screen or he tested positive. If it's the latter, I have no idea why they wouldn't have given that info 2 seconds of airtime. But overall, the SDSO messaging has been atrocious so I'll acknowledge that it *could maybe possibly* just be stupidity. 

I wonder which bodycam(s) the uncut footage is going to come from. They were testing with a $20,000+ TruNarc device which is supposed to minimize the need for contact with suspected narcotics. How much handling was there and was it appropriate and done correctly? The 2019 field testing procedures say gloves and laser filtering glasses are the only PPE required to test with the TruNarc. If it hasn't happened already, they need to add mask to the list.

549,2021-08-10 08:25:00+00:00,"As for the more vexing problem of starting material acquisition, obtaining pharma grade narcotics in substantial enough qty is no easy task in today‚Äôs opiophobic society. They‚Äôve even put codeine under tight control.

  
When you can find morphine tablets, which were quite abundant and relatively cheap 15 years ago during the heyday of oxycosmopolitan society (which is why my morphine acylation adventures took place a while ago), they are in the garbage MSContin formulation. The water-insoluble gel/wax-binders make isolation of the API impractical.

  
The most practical way to acquire the starting material is through horticulture (heroinculture). This requires a green thumb, patience, weeding, vigilant garden gnomes (with added night vision and LE detection systems), harvesting and extraction. Such a task is deserving of its own separate monograph. Which is best saved for after this year‚Äôs harvest season when I will (hopefully, keeping my cameltoe crossed) have something to write about (wink, wink).

  
\-----------  
We‚Äôve briefly reviewed the importance of N-acylations in other classes of the opiosphere (4-anilidopiperidines). While N-acylation is less common in the morphinan arena, there are a few commercially important amine acylations.

  
The most commercially relevant is the use of N-acetyl (or N-formyl) as a protecting-group on an industrially important dextromethorphan precursor, octabase, which undergoes Grewe Cyclization to form the morphinan.

  
The commercially relevant dextro-enantiomer of racemethorphan is the non-narcotic cough suppressant dextromethorphan (DXM). Global production of this quintessential Robotripping ingredient ranges in the hundreds of tonnes/annum.

  
The narcotic levo-antipode, levomethorphan, which can be 3-demethylated to yield the potent opioid levorphanol, has diminished in clinical significance over time to the point where current levorphanol production barely registers on the INCB list of global narcotic production quotas.

  
Nonetheless, levorphanol is very useful to the informed pain specialist. It has an exceptionally high-degree of Incomplete Cross Tolerance (ICT), making it a useful tool for clinical opioid-rotation. This high ICT ratio is especially useful for helping chronic pain patients decrease their overall morphine tolerance. The ICT ratio varies based on starting dose of morphine, but some regimens state that 1 mg of levorphanol can be substituted for every 25 mg of morphine. Many serious pain patients can work their way up to 500 mg of morphine per day (or more). The possibility of reducing a patient‚Äôs narcotic tolerance by substituting the 500 mg morphine dose for an equivalent 20-25 mg of daily levorphanol has an appeal, esp in the opiophobic prescribing environment.

  
The N-aralkyl norlevorphanol derivs, highlighted earlier, have a worthwhile recreational potential based solely on the merits of the euphoria. The lack of precursor regulation, the lack of controlled intermediates in certain derivations of its synthesis, the relatively high yield of the optimized syntheses, and the fact that Ro4-1538 is not explicitly included in the CSA, UN Convention, or any other drug prohibition regimes.

  
The addition of N-acetyl (or N-formyl) to the 1-benzyloctahydroisoquinoline precursor (octabase) allows for a near 400-fold kinetic improvement in the Grewe Cyclization compared to the use of non-acylated N-nor- or N-methyl-octabase.

  
The reactivity benefits come about as a result of the electron withdrawing effects of the acyl group. This decreases the basicity of the nitrogen, increasing the overall reactivity of the system and increasing rxn yield. In practice, N-formylation (aldehyde) is preferred over N-acetyl for the ease of deprotection (N-deformylation occurs more readily than N-acetylation). The original patent, however, cites equally impressive improvements in yield using either of the carbonyl-containing substituents.",1

Normally, I would have suggested trying to make filtered tea if you cannot digest the plant particulate matter. It's a harder thing for most (or all) people to digest. 

However, at your prior dose, starting with extracts, ideally with a plan to taper down might be necessary. 

It's a different situation when a person has begun to use for recreational purposes--they can try tapering down slowly over time. They just need to avoid withdrawals. If a person is dealing with *severe* pain, and their dose got that high by their doctor or on their own--kratom can be used to step down, but it is not likely to deliver that kind of relief without extremely high doses.

Taking 6-7 shots per day is an *extremely* high dose. Heavy doses of kratom won't have the same risks of harm that comes from extremely high doses of classic opiates (or the risks that come from buying them on the illicit market where there they are sometimes substituted for fentantyl or of unknown potency/purity). 

That said, they are still very heavy doses and that use pattern is hard to sustain.

Extracts (such as shots) are always going to be more expensive because it takes a lot of plant material to process into them. They will never get more extract than they start with from botanical sources (though they may be able to convert some MG to 7-OH-MG). The cost issue is similar for people who don't have insurance.

It just isn't a sustainable pattern unless you are extremely wealthy. 

You can try reducing the dose (1/2 of 1 less shot) for a few days and see if your pain level is similar. If your pain is not worse, in a few days you can try reducing again. Then repeat. However this means buying and taking heavy doses as you work yourself downward. 

At 60mL (about 7 shots), even reducing your use by 10% every 3 days, which is aggressive, it is going to take you 100 days to get to zero, and about 250 bottles of 8.8mL shots.

Eventually--you'll dose yourself down as much as as you can until but you hit the point where your pain just requires a certain amount of medication--whatever that medication may be.

I think if this is your situation, as much as I don't want to say it--you really need to look at medical intervention. I don't think your use is sustainable, and you are going to need significant support either to stop, or need medical support to deal with the kind of pain and other issues you have going on.",1

From DEA 2019 National Drug Threat assessment

Fentanal trafficked across the SWB from Mexico is typified by large volumes that are low in purity (less than 10 percent pure on average).

Mexican TCOs continue trafficking fentanal in multi-kilogram quantities commingled with other drug shipments across the SWB. These TCOs combine fentanal with diluents in clandestine facilities in Mexico prior to moving the drugs to the SWB region. According to CBP and DEA reporting, fentanal mixtures with other illicit drugs are relatively uncommon at the wholesale level, meaning the mixing of fentanal with heroin and other illicit drugs takes place inside the United States, not in Mexico. This indicates the mixing of fentanal with other illicit drugs is not representative of an overall strategy by Mexican TCOs.

From DEA 2020 National Drug Threat Assessment

Fentanal powder exhibits analyzed through the FSPP averaged 8.7 percent pure in 2019, an increase of 11.5 percent from the average purity of 7.8 percent in 2018. Only five of the 508 exhibits analyzed had purities that exceeded the 90 percent mark typical of the fentanal seized from parcel shipments to the United States from chemical companies based in China.

Samples from 100g-999g, when you exclude the rare high purity parcel seized in the mail, was 4.5% average

Of course animals are not the same as humans, they(debatably) lack much of the higher thought and critical thinking present in humans. However, it is simply undeniable on psychological grounds that they experience pain, and indeed most emotion in the same way that humans do. An animal experiences love in the exact same chemical way a human does in the production of oxycotin. If an animal feels pain and emotion in the same way as a human does, how can we justify slaughtering and consuming it for mere sensory pleasure. That is essentially the vegan argument",15

662,2021-08-05 20:57:09+00:00,"Where I am, if the PO has concerns the PO would have you sign a release of information to the prescribing doctor.  The probation agreement here states that the person on supervision has to sign any release of information required by the PO.  If someone refused to sign, that would result in a hearing before the judge.

Once the release is signed (or court ordered)  the PO would contact the prescribing  doctor to verify the medications and they may go over any concerns they have regarding a potential for abuse - this is more likely for medications like Xanex or Morphene.  This discussion could include checking to see if levels are tested or if alternative medications are a possibility.

It would be highly unlikely for a PO here to just tell you that you cannot take medications that have been prescribed without a discussion with your doctor.

However, like you mentioned, things are going to vary by jurisdiction.",3

Nuk eshte ndonje habi e madhe qe shume shqiptare asaj kohe luftuan per osmanet, sikurse vepruan shume greke apo sllave qe nuk kishin ndergjegje kombtare, por ishin te dhene ndaj pozicioneve qe kishin apo privilegjeve qe kishin ne rangjet e perandorise. Edhe te qenit musliman e humbi rendesine pas kryengritjeve ne kohen e tanzimatit, pasi muslimanet shqiptare u armiqsuan me osmanllinjte per shkak te reformave. Pra, edhe vete osmanet e kuptuan perfundimisht qe muslimanet shqiptare nuk ishin me besnike ndaj perandorise, packa ky mosbesim ishte krijuar qysh ne kohen e Pashalleqeve te Janines dhe Shkodres.

Prandaj, me vjen keq qe filo osmanllijt e sotem, kapen mas Skenderbeut. jo po i krishter jo po vrau myslimont. Rendesia luftes se Skenderbeut , me shume, per mendimin tim gjithmone, konsiston ne krijimin e nje shteti apo me mir te themi, ne hedhjen e themeleve te nje shteti mesjetar shqiptar qe u njoh nga shtetet me me influence ne Europe sic ishte Papati, Republika Venetikut, Mbreteria e Napolit, etj... Por rendesia me e madhe per ne, ishte krijimi i  identitetit Shqiptar, perkundrejt atij Arberor. Arvanitasit, Suliotet, madje edhe Camet, per fat te keq nuk krijuan solidaritet me njeri tjetrin. Dhe per mendimin tim, nuk jane fajtore sepse nuk u perfshine ne luftrat e Skenderbeut kunder Turqve. Ndersa, beratasit, vlonjatet, dibranet, malesoret, dukagjinsit dhe shqiptaret e veriut ne pergjithsi, edhe pse u muslimanizuan, solidariteti i identiteti shqiptar mbizotroi mbi prejardhjet krahinore dhe fetare.

Shkurtimisht, mendoj se ne, me shum duhet te perqendrohemi ne rendesine e Lidhjes se Lezhes se sa tek kulti i Skenderbeut. Dakort, per shek 19, kur levizejt romantike e humaniste ne Evrope ishin te modes asaj kohe, eshte e pranueshme qe ne te promovonim kultin e nje heroi qe shpetoi kombin. Por kohet kane ndryshuar, prandaj edhe shume studiuese e meshojne ketij aspekti dhe gjoja studione mitin e Skenderbeut. Sa me pare te kuptojme qe roli i Skenderbeut eshte i pamohueshem ne shtetformimin e nje shteti mesjetar shqiptar. Le te mos harrojme qe argumenti kryesor i vendeve fqinje ishte qe shqiptaret nuk jane ne gjendje te formojne shtet. Ne e dime shume mire qe ne u pushtuam nga vendet fqinje ne 1912, dhe mjaftoi nje deklarate pavarsie qe neve te na njihnin nderkombtarisht. Per mendimin tim, nese per ne, Evropa nuk do kishte njohur historine e Skenderbeut, ne do perfundomin si basket e Spanjes, apo me keq akoma, si kurdet ne Siri dhe Turqi.

Prandaj edhe keto qe flasin kunder Skenderbeut, duhet te kuptojne qe nese nuk do ekzisonte shtet shqiptar, te gjith muslimanet shqiptare, sot do ishin ne anadoll duke bere fushat per erdoganin, e jo per lulin apo ramen ... ndonje fatlum do ishte ne Bursa apo Izmir, por shumica, aty duke u kapur per fyti me kurdet do ishin kur ti venin flaken pyjeve.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Das ist jetzt ca. Zwei Jahre her da war ich 16, da ich nicht mehr an oxycodon, hydros usw rankomme habe ich mit heroin angefangen.. damals war es noch witzig und wenn Ich nichts hatte war es halt so, jetzt ist der entzug ein grund f√ºr mich immer weiter zu machen auch wenn ich mehrmals versucht habe aufzuh√∂ren.

Ich kann nat√ºrlich nicht f√ºr alle sprechen, ich kenne auch leute die das alle paar monate nehmen und manche die es gar nicht m√∂gen. Der Gro√üteil ist aber abh√§ngig.

At the risk of serious downvoting - one reason why gun manufacturers may be liable could be similar to the oxycotin producers.

How many guns are actually bought and kept by US owners every year? Now how many firearms are manufactured each year? If gun makers are making exorbitant numbers of guns, at a rate that exceeds the reasonable expectation of lawful US gun purchases, then they could be partially responsible for this illegal trade going to Mexico.

Guns last for a very long time. Many Americans inherit firearms. In fact, very few gun owners fire their guns enough to have to replace the whole thing. So how many guns are being made compared to the actual sales need is something worth examining. If they make exorbitant amounts of guns exceeding legal demand, they have to know that many are then being sold illegally or they are supplying an illegal trade.

Remember, the drug companies are getting sued because they produced more oxycotin than could possibly be legally prescribed during that period. So they were negligent or deliberately reckless in their actions.

This could be similar.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Having said that, I never waited more than an hour overall to talk to the doc. Getting an appointment with a specialist is occasionally a bit more complex, if you haven't been there before it really can take a month or more to get an appointment, having said that: if you have a valid reason (like pain, sudden appearance of symptoms,...) you can just call the secretary, explain the situation and she will tell you a time when it's usually quiet and you can just show up or you can ask very nicely that they call you when someone aborts their appointment. Or you can simply call another specialist: I recently had to get to a lung specialist for a Stresstest, a neurologist and had to get an MRT. It took me overall 6 phonecalls and I got all appointments within a week. EKG (stress and 24h versions) were done at my normal doc.

About your problems with having to wait for your Medication in Germany. I don't see why you have a problem with that. Once the doc prescribes it, you simply take the prescription to the next pharmacy and get the meds. Worst case is they don't have it in store, then you either go to the next one or get it delivered (usually on the same day free of extra charge). There were a few problems when the UK left the EU, some meds, fetanyl for example, came from there but that problem has been solved and other pharmacies had it in store, also docs have all kinds of meds from samples to full packages, their share their stash willingly if you can't get it anywhere else. 

Getting procedures done, yeah that can take a while, but it's understandable, doctors are busy, however: there's literally no reason to not call other doctors who might have a less busy schedule or to ask your doc to make a phonecalls to accelerate the process.

I know the system in Germany is far from perfect but if you can use a phone it's very manageable.",1

In my country (CH) we had a heroin wave in the 80s to mid 90s. What did we do? We decriminalised heroin for the addicts (at least partially). Especially the social democratic party pushed for this change in the law (I vote for them, so I'm a communist from an American point of view ;-) ).  
  
The problem is mainly the cheap fetanyl. If heroin were distributed to addicts in a state-controlled manner, they would suffer less.

Was prescribed 3600mg a day and quickly got addicted to it. Didn't have any clue what to expect until I started running low with no more refills or means to find more. Physical withdrawal was bad, similar to opiates surprisingly. Uncomfortable, sweats/chills, diariah, insomnia. You name it I felt it. BUT the worst was the mental withdrawal. Depression, insanity, absolutely no thoughts at all really. The worst part was not being able to hold conversation or being able to focus. I also tried to kill myself one day coming off this stuff.

Went into treatment for gabapentin this time instead of fentanyl and after a 2 month run at 4000mg a day it took about a month to feel okay and 2 months to feel some what normal.

It's not a good drug to abuse and it literally drove me insane. Rehab tapered me from 4000mg a day to nothing for 2 days. That was awful. Then tapered me from 600mg to 0 in a week.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

The problem is of course she cannot communicate and spells things with her eyes, and during an episode of oxygen drop and the meds on top she pretty much cannot communicate, it‚Äôs even hard to get a yes or a no, so becomes an issue with really knowing what SHE wants and needs other than what we read on her stats.
We have been doing fats flowing oxygen bursts during her episode with little to no reaction from her body, and currently trying to connect her bipap to an oxygen part that should assist her with oxygen.
She does not eat very much and as mentioned a tiny little vessel. But her drive to live is massive. We pretty much have two phases now of her either sleeping and things stabilising more other awake with oxygen drops and heart racing.
Just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences from caring for a loved one at home and how they coped and what they did to help",1
