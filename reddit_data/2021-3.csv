He had previously done this at a different traffic stop. Unfortunately this time he succumbed to the effects of a fentynyl overdose. In other words, floyd did not die by a legal restraint technique, he died because of the effects of ingesting a large quantity of fentynyl in an attempt to hide it.",1

I guess that would be a 30[a 20 if he's really ur peeps] ever since I started ive gotten nothing less than 1.7 which is a 100 for me but I would just do .1 3 times. Honestly because u gonna like it if it supposed to do wut its supposed to then break it in half &amp; do that. It should take like 5-15mins tops to hit &amp; the drip is way heavier than H (well the bullshit Im getting right now) I don't get get drips with H unless its the ""popi bags"" I guess they call it that cuz the Spanish boys are the only ones that be having it but once my stimulus get here I will send for sum from the Netherlands 10 grams of #3 &amp; 10 grams of #4 &amp; if it gets too me &amp; if its wut its supposed to be than u can get over 900 bundles off that 20 grams &amp; if u do it the right way at 20 dollars a bundle (I.e.. pop I bags) that's over 18 thousand dollars off of 300 bucks yo.. That's how the brothers in the 70s were getting so rich but the only difference is the interface. The had to go thru the Italians &amp; I have to go through the internet &amp; Bitcoins &amp; encryption &amp; escrow &amp; mailman &amp; finally mailbox but if all fails then the safety net is escrow but if the deals seems too good then its probably not wise to fuck wit that. Look at the responses from all others good &amp; bad &amp; decide. Also, ive ordered hash from overseas (Netherlands) &amp; I got it in 10 days so if the deal is in escrow &amp; u can afford it then take that gamble cuz if they say they'll send it then rock out but do ur research first &amp; if u have to pay a little more for their service then I rather do that then to fuck wit someone who's on sum bullshit cuz its a waist of time, its takes forever to dispute it to get ur money back but at least u can get ur coins back but the darkweb is the best place to get anything u want but beware that everything ive ever gotten off their has been potent as hell. Its not for scary lightweight people so either if ur trying to buck up or personal its the place for you. All u have to do is find the stores which I rather deal with them because of escrow but the mushroom guy is so thorougho u can trust him but he is the only person I would give my money to upfront (isn't that a shame) smfh, be careful of those FE's finalize early escrow is to protect u unless u have it to throw away ive never ever finalize early I don't care wut they say or how long ive dealt with them never. Thats how they exit scam. The only countries I order from other thr United States is United Kingdom &amp; the Netherlands &amp; maybe Germany but thats if they say they will send it. Don't order a whole bunch of little packages at once &amp; don't do a whole bunch no more than a kilo or pound &amp; I would be easy on that. Half of that would be good enough &amp; wait 2 weeks to a month unless u have other addresses u trust &amp; don't use fake names. Ive had every order come to my front door &amp; didn't break a sweat trust me unless they get tipped off or the sender fuck up the packaging Thats it.. I write all this is to say the darkweb is the way to go unless u have the connects out in the real world which I don't not with the quality &amp; price the prices will amaze u. U will have no choice but to sell sum cuz one sale u could make ur money back. Yall follow me?? IM jumping back in ASAP if I had the money I would of been in but I don't have no one who would invest in ur brother but no need cuz when I get it I can say fuck all Yall I did it on my own &amp; yea this is wut I been telling ya scary asses for years..

4,2021-03-31 17:16:49+00:00,"I agree with most comments here.   First let me tell you that I’m coming from a similiar situation the only thing is my boyfriend is a cereal cheater and full well knows what he’s doing he simply just does not care enough about himself first off and secondly does not have enough live or respect for me to be decent and treat me with the liydd as lay SND respect any body would treat there own dog with ,   He even lies straight faced to me for long periods of time claiming to have been so decent and loyal only to find out like I s as Keats do that he’s a two faced lieing animal with moral compus?   How do you go back to ever trusting a minipulative coward ever again after that.    Just recently I was finding things that kinda stood out to me in things I read and then conversations that were had that there might be a person of interest that may or may not be coming around from out of the city or Provence , it was really quite Vaugue to me but non the less it stayed with me for some time until just recently I was doing laundry and kept coming across clothing that was far to large to have been his or mine for that matter as being an extra large anything is not something I subscribe to but at any rate not only was it one or two things. It was shirts pants hats and most notably do-rags if I’ve said that properly and unless I’m mistaken other articles of clothing to suggest that a man of colour was now not only dating him but sooarrbtky living with him as the amount of clothing would suggest and thus my suspicions of sonrr Ed I’ve from out of the city were put to rest , that and all the receipts that were found only painted a perfect picture of there time spent together ,  sll this while if befn at home mostly thinking about him and most of the time but bring Abel to reach him and so on and so on. To add insult to injury I also found done oxi morphene and other such drugs that are not welcome in my home for any reason shape or form. His family is as Lao all out of province and he often says how he misses them ...  come to think of it actually he never does say that ,  must be that he’s relieved to a certain extent to be away from them.  All the same he’s been here now for over 15 years I think so this must feel like home.   My point to most of this is what are you really going to help yourself first ?    Are you abusive?   Do you include him or her in everything that you do ?  Do you even really want to be with that person ?   Just because you can see that this person might be a catch SND the people around you would live to have a chance with him or her and it might make you a bit jelouse is that a good reason to keep that person in your life ?  Sounds kinda selfish if that’s the case ?   Why do you want to stay with this person so badly ?  You mention you get along well ?   How so. ?   Is it only sexually?   Are you faithful ?   Can you ever be faithful ?  If the answer is no SND you’ve already proven that you can not be trusted then maybe now is the time to back off and go get your own life away from them. ,   They deserve SND demand the right to be respected and loved SND to be the most important thing in your life , after all isent this sbiut being with this person for your life or is it a just a fling. ?  Decide what works and maybe you can work something out so you don’t lose this person for good ,    Sounds like a lot of work to me. Depending on how does I add l the person is to you will depend on how much iou actually care to put into this.     Do you depend on this person for shelter and safety. ?   Is that what this is about ,  the list goes on and on. .    Maybe just go start fresh with yourself. And don’t include other people.    If you really love this person the way you say then have you ever just bitten the bullet and been shockingly honest with them about everything even if you don’t need to because they just might not know something ?  The only way to move forward is to leave no dirty secret to secret ,   All must be revealed if your ever going to have a chance in hell.    If rightfully are honest to the king you think he or she will murder you then you might have a chance. Because it’s after all the hurt and pain clear that there appears a place of complete solid ground for once where everything us in the table and there nothing else but a foundation of solid rock that you each might hook your buckles to and start from a solid place to grow from and see what happens. But the more you lie and sugar coat bullshit the more apart you grow.     Out some thought into what you want.  If it is still that person then go tell them.  And try to communicate what you want  and if it’s not then just stay away and don’t be a loser about it.    Don’t speak badly or blame them
For anything anymore.    Just move on and do it in silence nobody wants to hear your bad mouthing. It only makes you look weak and foolish.    Just dissapear      And sometimes it’s better to dissapear and save that person more hurt then it is to stay and continue to cause all this un neccessary  pain because you have self esteem issues and cheat and basically afford this person no dignity or happiness.

And everyone in Germany has a healthcare insurance thats pretty good and pays a lot for therapies, Methadone and other neeeded meds.

blade armor has better alternatives such as dom ice and antiq, and it doesn't actually counter claude nor kimmy, since they just lifesteal the health back, (claude has shield on his ult aswell)

Immortality, which i agree is controversial but i stand by it, shouldn't be used on tanks, since getting more stats will make you unkillable, and if it happens that u must sac urself, then its still a waste of an item, theyll just kill u twice (ik it gives def stats but as much as other items)

Cursed helmet i consider a troll item, it gives like 1/3 of athena shields magic res and as for the dmg, tanks job is to protect his team not deal dmg.

Thunderbelt i only recently started to build and it is of more use than Immortality and blade armor

The good thing is u mentioned mask, which is the most important item and should always be rushed. It gives you more passive gold, more gold for assists and kills, gives regeneration aura for your team, increases their dmg and lets them farm.

And one thinv you forgot is tank emblem, unless you use atlas or khufrq (cc heavy tanks) then you NEED tabk emblems, youre paper without them

Regardless the point is that he ingested the pills after encountering the police, its very likely if he was let go from the car or station then he would have dropped dead later due to the ingested pills.

22,2021-03-31 02:01:28+00:00," **[resumo]** Autor do livro “Cativeiro sem Fim” contesta crítica do general Eduardo Villas Bôas, ex-comandante do Exército, de que falta isenção e verossimilhança ao trabalho. Para o jornalista, tentativa de refutar a pesquisa, a respeito de sequestros de crianças e adolescentes por militares nos anos 1960 e 1970 no Brasil, explicita o medo da verdade e a intenção de escrever uma narrativa idealizada sobre o período militar.

       

 Pela primeira vez desde que lancei “Cativeiro sem Fim” (ed. Alameda), em 2019, um integrante do Exército comenta a denúncia feita no livro-reportagem, que conta a história de 19 brasileiros e brasileiras, filhos de militantes políticos ou simpatizantes da oposição, [que foram sequestrados pelos militares nas décadas de 1960 e 1970 no Brasil. ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/11/sequestros-de-criancas-comprovam-violencia-extrema-da-ditadura.shtml)

 O general da reserva Eduardo Villas Bôas,[ em entrevista ao professor Celso Castro publicada no recém-lançado livro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/02/livro-de-ex-chefe-do-exercito-expoe-a-volta-da-politica-aos-quarteis.shtml) “General Villas Bôas – Conversa com o Comandante”, dispara contra a reportagem e expõe claramente todo o esforço das forças militares em direcionar a construção da história do Brasil.

  

  

 Ele ataca as iniciativas que contribuem para o esclarecimento de episódios escondidos durante décadas, como o sequestro de bebês e crianças pelos militares. Deixa às claras uma prática negacionista e obscura do pensamento [de parte dos militares que outrora participaram dos movimentos da ditadura e hoje estão ligados ao poder.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/06/ditadura-formou-geracao-de-militares-que-hoje-povoam-governo-bolsonaro.shtml)

  No capítulo 10, o general, [que comandou o Exército de 2014 a 2019](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/bolsonaro-nao-e-volta-dos-militares-mas-ha-o-risco-de-politizacao-de-quarteis-diz-villas-boas.shtml), critica as políticas de memória, verdade e justiça que ganharam corpo nos últimos anos. No parágrafo que tece comentários sobre o livro “Cativeiro sem Fim”, também revela seu preconceito quanto ao trabalho de jornalistas, pesquisadores, historiadores, antropólogos e de entidades que trazem à tona as crueldades praticadas pelos militares durante a ditadura, fatos que dormiam em sono profundo provocado pela ação e construção de narrativas pelas Forças Armadas.

 Esse direcionamento possibilitou[ a elaboração da história sob o prisma militar, sem diversificar as fontes de informações.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/06/foi-facil-entrar-na-ditadura-dificil-foi-sair.shtml)

 “Recentemente, alguém ligado aos direitos humanos trouxe à tona um tópico sobre o qual nunca ouvi falar, de que cento e tantas crianças teriam sido sequestradas e afastadas dos pais. Essa e outras narrativas, a exemplo de um suposto massacre de índios, na abertura da BR-174, que liga Manaus a Boa Vista, carecem de verossimilhança e contribuem para a falta de isenção na conclusão das apurações. Como você disse, adquirem um caráter de ajuste histórico”, afirmou.

 Villas Bôas quer estimular a dúvida nos brasileiros a respeito da verossimilhança das denúncias, apontando suposta “falta de isenção” do livro. Ele se esquece, contudo, de que todo trabalho de pesquisa segue metodologias científicas, e o mesmo se deu na apuração dos fatos denunciados em “Cativeiro sem Fim”.

 Gostaria de obter uma explicação de Villas Bôas sobre o que chama de “falta de isenção na conclusão das apurações”.[ Estão relatadas no livro histórias de 19 pessoas que tiveram suas vidas totalmente transformadas pelo crime de sequestro.](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/12/1562460-brasil-precisa-julgar-crimes-dos-dois-lados-na-ditadura-diz-diretor-de-ong.shtml) Foram retiradas do meio de suas famílias biológicas, levadas para longe dos locais de nascimento e convívio familiar.

 Tiveram suas identidades adulteradas. Ganharam documentos falsos obtidos junto a repartições públicas. Tudo isso ocorreu com anuência de uma cadeia de comando militar,[ seguida pela complacência de funcionários públicos, de cartórios, de hospitais, empresários e outros cidadãos.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/07/memoria-historica-da-ditadura-militar-e-tema-de-live-nesta-quinta.shtml)

 [No livro agrupei depoimentos em primeira pessoa dessas vítimas da ditadura que ficaram invisibilizadas por meio século.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/vitimas-da-ditadura-pedem-ao-stf-que-proiba-comemoracao-do-golpe-de-64.shtml) O sequestro foi uma decisão de Estado. Não há discurso que possa justificar a barbárie cometida contra esses brasileiros, que hoje procuram por seus pais biológicos.

 [Das 19 vítimas, 11 eram ligadas à Guerrilha do Araguaia.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/03/documentario-recupera-historias-da-guerrilha-do-araguaia.shtml) São filhos de guerrilheiros com camponesas locais, filhos de agricultores que cooperaram com a guerrilha e até crianças sequestradas por engano pelos militares durante o conflito. Além disso, novos casos surgiram a partir do lançamento da obra, objetos agora de novas apurações.

 Villas Bôas comenta também que a divulgação desses casos “adquire um caráter de ajuste histórico”.  
 Garanto que a exposição dessas duras histórias de vida nada tem de revanchismo ou se precipita ao sensacionalismo histórico. Todos os relatos seguem os mais qualificados preceitos de pesquisa científica.

 Passaram por duros crivos de apuração. Todos os depoimentos, fatos e documentos obtidos —vejam bem, documentos— foram checados e rechecados. A busca de mais de uma fonte de informação garantiu isenção à narrativa que caracteriza o caráter histórico-científico da reportagem investigativa.

 O livro não faz apologia à ditadura, [narrativa que as Forças Armadas tentam construir desde 1964.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/02/serie-de-tv-evita-o-termo-ditadura-ao-falar-de-crimes-cometidos-por-militares.shtml) Possui, contudo, a devida isenção para mostrar histórias de brasileiros e brasileiras invisibilizados à força. Não tenta impor uma versão sobre o passado. Utiliza várias fontes de informação para expor esse crime.

 Foram ouvidos vários lados envolvidos, inclusive as Forças Armadas, que preferiram tergiversar e não responder diretamente aos questionamentos deste repórter.

 Todos os relatos estão recheados de verdade, de dor. Mostram a violência por que passaram essas vítimas de sequestro quando bebês e crianças. Expõem uma face cruel e sanguinária dos militares que participaram do golpe de 1964 no Brasil. Ajudam a construir a memória brasileira em todos matizes, sem preconceito ou direcionamento. Isso sim é verossimilhança.

 O general Villas Bôas vai além na sua análise de informações que diz desconhecer. Antes de falar sobre “Cativeiro sem Fim”, ele é bem claro. Quer que as histórias que por ventura ainda careçam de ser narradas sejam retomadas nas próximas gerações. “Temos esperança de que essas questões fiquem para serem retomadas com maior isenção quando as gerações que os viveram já tenham passado”, afirmou.

 Isso sim leva ao registro inverossímil dos fatos da ditadura.[ É como matar as vítimas pela segunda vez.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/regime-militar-matou-poucas-pessoas-diz-mourao-ao-le-monde.shtml) Pergunto: qual a dificuldade em aceitar hoje o relato de vítimas vivas da ditadura?

 Esperar que essas vítimas não estejam mais entre nós para só então divulgar suas histórias[ revela muito medo de que a verdade apareça](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/05/chefe-da-cia-disse-que-geisel-assumiu-controle-sobre-execucoes-sumarias-na-ditadura.shtml). Explicita que o projeto de construção de narrativas sobre a ditadura desencadeado pelas forças militares é manco, baseado somente em fontes que não podem mais contar sua parte na história.[ Isso sim é direcionamento, falta de isenção. ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml)

 “Cativeiro sem Fim” mostra uma visão mais complexa da ditadura. Obscura e suja. E dá a partida para que novos fatos e personagens, outrora escondidos, ganhem vida e revelem suas histórias. Está totalmente baseado em fatos reais, em personagens de carne e osso. Um trabalho científico.

 A verdade sempre aparece. E incomoda os que têm culpa e cometeram crimes. Contar a verdade é qualificar a democracia.",1

37,2021-03-30 12:01:08+00:00,"Is the above person trying to make up stuff, I’m not sure whether it is clear from his comment. We know heroin is very addictive but by juxtaposing it with no accepted medical use - the Uk for example does allow diamorphine to be prescribed to addicts , something advised by our drugs advisory council [see this](https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/migrated/files/1859350836.pdf) from 2003, but in doubt, [280 people received a prescription in 2017](https://idhdp.com/en/resources/news/august-2020/saved-from-a-horrible-fate-legal-heroin-prescribed-to-hundreds-of-uk-drug-users-figures-reveal.aspx) so it’s not unheard of. Also it’s not hard to find that in some cases [dimorphine hydrochloride](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/diamorphine-hydrochloride.html) may be used for sedation in general.

Same with saying alcohol reduces risk of heart-disease (which might be seen in moderate use in  some studies of people with _under control_ diabetes) and saying no paralysis, and preventing diabetes. As I say, alcohol wouldn’t show a correlation even in moderation because of how we understand how it effects blood sugar modulation (even modulated red wine intake can be advised against.) Old studies that show this are known not exactly to have accounted for abstinence and it is difficult to normalise accounting for other lifestyle choices (wine drinkers in general are better off, and its combination with other lifestyle choices afforded to them by their relative wealth can also explain the benefits.) the French problem as it were, was observed in both red wine and white wine drinking regions, where we should have expected much more of a benefit in red wine regions. It is probably just healthier to abstain than have red wine in general , though there’s an argument that it’s the “least bad” of alcohol to have. 

Is heroin as far as dangerous as alcohol though is the problem? There is a perception of it being dangerous by society and currently it can be given it gets cut with fentanyl and other substances. Now as for its risk as per both substances ideally, I don’t think we can make the claim that it is as dangerous. Heroin is known to cause deterioration of brain white matter, but so does alcohol. Alcohol is a direct contributor to liver cancer - whilst the reduction in blood phosphorus from heroin users may reduce the development of cancer. Not to say someone should use heroin, just that it’s not as clear cut as saying alcohol is far less dangerous than heroin and obviously more long time use needs to be studied to quantify that. 

I’m not sure the comment you refer to is actually trying to make up garbage stuff because of how they’ve juxtaposed misconceptions together. You can make the argument that heroin is less hard than alcohol especially in a legal system, and it wouldn’t be something that’s automatically “making up garbage”",1

46,2021-03-30 03:29:41+00:00,"Right! Nicotine itself isn't the stimulant, but it does have an indirect stimulant effect. 

It's similar to how some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants are able to exert a very mild opioid effect on the body. They are believed to stimulate the periaqueductal grey and median raphe nucleus regions of the brain stem, which have projections into the dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord where endorphins and enkephalins are released. Endorphins and enkephalins are substances produced by the body which bind to opioid receptors in the spinal cord, so their release exerts an endogenous form of pain relief. 

Quick fun fact: the word ""endorphin"" comes from the portmanteau of ""**end**ogenous m**orphin**e."" The word ""enkephalin"" is similarly constructed from an older term for proposed substances that exist in the brain stem.",1

What I see as a bigger issue, that very likely is going to be glossed over regardless of verdict, is there are a lot of people who don't think drug addicts should have consequences for poor life choices. You can't ignore the context of Floyd's choices as they directly lead to each step of the interaction. He moves to Minnesota for ""a new start"" and shortly after is passing counterfeit bills and passing out in a car with meth/Fentenyl pills and not only took those pills prior but also tries to swallow more to hide them from police. Or Jacob Blake, assaults his girlfriend, steals her car and credit cards, and fights police. Brianna Taylor, sure she had started some schooling to become an EMT but was very likely involved in a homicidal drug ring.

92,2021-03-28 03:51:07+00:00,"There's a wide variety. Nsaids such as Tylenol and aspirin are probably the most common, though anything a client uses for pain management can impact their pain perception. This can include prescription drugs like oxycotin or self medication like Marijuana. 

Physiological conditions can impact a client's pain perception, and this also has a wide variety. Diabetes is the main one I can think of, as sometimes sensory perception in extremities can be altered. Though neurological conditions like a nerve root being impeded could alter perception as well in some cases. 

Sometimes convective tissue like fascia can be really restricted and that can impact the ""depth"" of a treatment. Sometimes people with restricted fascia will want a lot of pressure thinking more pressure = deep = best treatment. you can press pretty hard and they still may not feel it. In this case, doing fascia work and releases will help you get into the deeper layers. The techniques come off as light sometimes, as you're addressing superficial tissue but can be intense in their own way and will allow for deeper work as the treatment goes forward. 

Emotions/ stress play a large role in how people perceive pain, though I find i encounter this in the opposite direction where a stressed/sad/ anxious client may be hyper sensitive. One treatment you could have your elbow in their traps and they can take it well then next treatment they may hardly be able to effleurage.  I'm uncertain if there are certain mental illnesses or emotional states that could make someone disconnect from feeling physical pain, but it's possible.

Generally I take it on a case by case basis. I go through the intake form with my clients and ask them questions about any conditions and medications they highlighted. Some ""red flag"" conditions for pain perception i would consider would be diabetes as I mentioned, paralysis, stroke, tingling or numbness. If I see pain medication listed i also ask how long ago they were taken and if they have noticed any changes to their pain perception. 

Also if while I'm working on a client and I suspect their sensation to be altered I do ask them about it. I'll check in if they may have taken anything they might have been shy of telling me earlier. I don't want to come off as accusatory so I just ask ""I'm using quite a bit of pressure here, have you taken anything that could have impacted your pain perception today?"" It's also good to use context clues as well. If I still suspect someone is lying to me, I don't push it, but I also don't give deeper pressure if i don't think it's to their benefit. If I think the pressure they're requesting is beyond reasonable and could ultimately be harmful, I don't do it. I explain to them that more pressure  isn't always better, or equal to deeper (especially in cases where I have to do a lot of fascia work to eventually work deeper tissue) and in some cases, I may express concern for them if they have a hard time feeling what I'm doing and to get checked out by their doctor as it may be a symptom of a bigger issue. 

I hope you find this helpful.",1
93,2021-03-28 02:04:53+00:00," Inglês, alemão, creole. As três línguas são faladas pelo ator Welket Bungué, de 33 anos, ao longo das [três horas de ""Berlin Alexanderplatz""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2021/02/berlin-alexanderplatz-traz-ecos-expressionistas-em-nova-versao.shtml), em cartaz no streaming agora. Na nova versão da trama, um clássico da literatura alemã, [ele é um refugiado que encontra um destino trágico](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/10/berlin-alexanderplatz-retona-as-telas-como-um-drama-de-refugiado.shtml) em meio à violência, o sexo e as luzes néon da madrugada berlinense.

 É em português, no entanto, que Bungué conversa com esta repórter por telefone, numa brecha das filmagens de um longa que ele protagoniza e que roda agora na Bélgica. O ator, nascido na Guiné-Bissau, na costa oeste africana, cresceu em Portugal. Mais especificamente, em Beja, no sul do país, num internato, onde morou dos 11 aos 19 anos. ""Só ia para casa nas férias, Páscoa, Natal.""

 Foi também em Portugal que Bungué descobriu e desenvolveu o gosto pela atuação, entre videocassetes alugados nos fins de semana —ele cita as performances de Will Smith em ""Inimigo do Estado"" e de Russel Crowe em ""Gladiador"" como algumas que mais o marcaram na época— e, mais tarde, a formação na Escola Superior de Teatro em Cinema, em Amadora, a 20 minutos de Lisboa.

 Foi no Brasil, porém, que a carreira de Bungué ganhou tração. Por causa de um mestrado, o ator se mudou para o Rio de Janeiro em 2012, quando a cidade estava ""no pico"", diz. Conta que estava decepcionado com as oportunidades que vinham sendo oferecidas a ele depois de um papel importante na minissérie ""Equador"", adaptação do best-seller de Miguel Sousa Tavares, exibida quatro anos antes.

 ""Estava entre os que eram na época os atores mais respeitados da indústria portuguesa. E isso não me deu, a meu ver, o respaldo e a atenção da mídia que teria em outro país"", diz. ""Saí de Portugal por ser muitas vezes obrigado a aceitar papéis residuais nas histórias. Estava sendo subaproveitado enquanto artista, escalonado para fazer personagens que na trama não tinham grande impacto.""

  O caminho que Bungué encontrou foi, então, virar um ator global. Ou melhor —""globalizado"", ele corrige, rindo. ""Ator global, você sabe, é da Globo.""

 Bungué hoje fala seis línguas. Aprendeu alemão em menos de seis meses para ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"". Para o longa de agora, estuda uólofe, idioma falado no Senegal e em outros países da costa ocidental da África.

 A aposta numa carreira ainda mais internacional foi reforçada no ano passado, quando ele enfim se mudou para Berlim, uma das cenas artísticas mais efervescentes da Europa.

 O ator, que passou os primeiros meses de pandemia no Rio, diz que chegou a pensar em fixar raízes por aqui, mas desistiu depois da eleição de Bolsonaro. ""E isso se revelou sintomático, porque na comunidade artística, todos os que puderam estão agora vivendo em Lisboa ou em Berlim."" Ele e a companheira ainda mantêm um apartamento no bairro de Santa Teresa, porém.

 Questionado se conhece outros atores que, como ele, não temem a barreira do território ou da língua, Bungué responde que isso não é exatamente novo. O que ele diz observar agora é uma autonomia maior dos descendentes da diáspora africana para atuar no mercado global. ""Agora temos acesso a uma maior diversidade de atores e atrizes, com perfis muito diferentes daqueles que a própria Globo vinha celebrando desde os anos 1980.""

 Bungué atuou, aliás, numa novela da emissora, ""Novo Mundo"". Também participou de uma série de filmes nacionais. Viveu um escravo, fiel escudeiro de Tiradentes, em [""Joaquim"", de Marcelo Gomes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2017/04/1876104-joaquim-filme-de-marcelo-gomes-traz-genese-do-heroi-tiradentes.shtml). Um operário imigrante em [""Corpo Elétrico"", de Marcelo Caetano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2017/08/1909603-corpo-eletrico-sobre-jovem-gay-foge-de-estereotipos-e-explora-sensualidade.shtml). E um contra-almirante inglês no [ainda inédito ""Pedro"", retrato intimista de dom Pedro 1º de Laís Bodanzky](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/12/com-caua-reymond-filme-de-lais-bodansky-faz-retrato-intimista-de-dom-pedro-1o.shtml).

 Uma das parcerias mais longevas desde que o ator veio para o Brasil é menos conhecida do público, no entanto. É com o cineasta capixaba Bernard Lessa, que ele conheceu ainda em terras lusas. Bungué atuou na maioria dos filmes que Lessa dirigiu. No último, ""A Matéria Noturna"", ainda em processo de finalização, vive um romance com uma motorista de aplicativo.

 Lessa diz que, das qualidades de Bungué, uma das mais marcantes é sua presença em cena. ""Ele pode não estar fazendo nada, mas você percebe que há uma densidade por trás. A câmera adora isso."" Além disso, acrescenta, ao mesmo tempo em que o ator não perde a câmera de vista, ele se deixa levar pelos personagens que interpreta, e tem uma grande capacidade de improviso.

 O último comentário é ecoado por outros cineastas que trabalharam com o ator. Marcelo Gomes lembra como ele trouxe textos em creole e coreografias aos ensaios de ""Joaquim"". Laís Bodanzky conta que Bungué e Isabél Zuaa, outra atriz portuguesa, estavam prestes a rodar suas cenas finais em ""Pedro"" quando sugeriram à diretora um novo desfecho para os personagens.

 ""Ainda bem que eles apertaram o botão vermelho e disseram 'essa cena está estranha'"", diz Bodanzky. ""Do ponto de vista narrativo, e principalmente do respeito às personagens pretas e dos seus destinos nos filmes.""

 ""Achávamos que o final que o roteiro propunha não era o mais justo para a trajetória dos dois personagens"", afirma Bungué sobre o episódio. ""Ao mesmo tempo, estamos contribuindo para que esse cinema que é feito com um enquadramento histórico não reproduza a imagem de descrédito e subalternidade de determinados perfis. Nós ficcionalizamos histórias, e essa ficção deve contribuir para elevar a autoestima e, sobretudo, trazer um imaginário mais livre entre interpretações estigmatizados. É nisso que acredito.""

 É uma busca que, quanto mais se conversa com Bungué, mais soa crucial para ele. Ele diz que parte do motivo pelo qual decidiu se mudar para o Brasil foi a percepção de que só assim entraria em contato com suas origens africanas –ele só voltou à Guiné-Bissau, da onde saiu aos três anos, em 2019. ""Uma mãe de santo me disse que eu voltaria"", conta, lembrando a passagem pela Bahia durante as gravações de ""Equador"".

 A questão ainda permeia suas incursões pela direção —ele já dirigiu mais de 15 curtas até agora. Seis deles serão exibidos numa mostra dedicada a Bungué no festival Cine Esquema Novo, que acontece entre 10 e 15 de abril de forma virtual e gratuita.

 ""Como ator, defendo o personagem. Mas como diretor, no limite, terei a oportunidade e a responsabilidade de expor as motivações estéticas, políticas e pessoais que estão na base daquele trabalho"", diz. Mas esclarece que não tem planos de abandonar a interpretação. ""Ser ator é o meu sonho concretizado. É aí que me vejo me expressando.""",1

100,2021-03-17 15:04:17+00:00,"Oh I know. I wasn't saying you feel or think that way, I was just saying that's how the general anti-drug uneducated type of people feel toward heroin/opioid addicts. 

I just wanted to point out that not all people are 'hopelessly' addicted. People like myself actually prefer life on opiates rather than sober because they provide the most benefit toward my mental health than any other psychiatric drug I've been on, without the hazardous side effects of traditional psychiatric medicine. 

After getting on maintenance, I even quit drinking alcohol and have become completely anti-alcohol in the past 5 years, where as before, I drank for 15 years any time I couldn't get any heroin or an opiate, I'd turn to drinking, dxm, any other drug I could get my hand on. Opiates calm that self destructive voice in my head. 

For some reason we as a society have come to view euphoria and feelings of well being (from a drug) as a side effect and a 'bad' thing, yet I can't understand why. As some one who struggles with major depressive disorder and anxiety, etc.. feeling euphoric is a hell of a trade off to the way I normally feel every day. 

Ultimately I would love to see something like what Switzlerland did here in America. Regulate heroin/opioids and allow people who are already addicted/dependent and don't mind being so, to use it legally. Other countries have done this &amp; even offer other opioids for maintenance like morphine, hydromorphine, extended release tramadol, etc.. 

But here in America we only have Methadone &amp; Bupe. Methadone is a hassle to get on unless you live ontop of a clinic. And buprenorphine is only a partial agonist with a ceiling effect, so it's effects are limited and increasing the dose doesn't add anything to it. I think both bupe and methadone are great tools but I personally would benefit more by having a short acting full agonist like diactylmorphine. That way whenever I dose, I actually get an effect, including the antidepressant, anti-anxiety and antipsychotic effects. Where as with these longer acting opioids like methadone &amp; bupe, your levels stay the same all the time and you don't even feel your dose. Therefore after awhile, all the positive benefits that one gets from opioids will go away and all your left with is the dependence. 

More lives would be saved too if people could access heroin &amp; their opioid of choice legally and safely,but no one seems to want to have this conversation because the idea of ""getting high"" or feeling good has been so heavily demonized and stigmatized. So people like myself and a lot of chronic pain patients are suffering because of everyone's ignorance and misunderstandings about addiction and the entire class of drugs known as opiates/opioids.",1

The conversions differ, and different countries have different conversion tables, in Scandinavia its like Denmark 5mg morphine = 100mg codeine = 100mg tramadol. Sweden 10mg mophine = 100mg codeine = 50mg tramadol. Norway 5mg morphine = 50mg Codeine = 50mg tramadol. and the rest of opioids is just as wrongfully converted.

106,2021-03-17 10:47:51+00:00,"Sorry, langer Text:  


Ja, ich sags dir, schlucken hat durchaus seine Vorteile. Bin seit 7j Nadelfrei, schlucke mein Substi seither. Davor hab ich auch über Jahre täglich 720mg in 5ml jeden Morgen IV konsumiert.  
Die Vorteile beim Schlucken sind ganz klar. Du bist konstant am Pegel und kriegst diese Gedanken und die Gier, die sich ständig um die Opiate dreht, weg.

Grösster Borteil für mich war auch, dass ich morgens nicht mehr enzügig aufwache. Die Dosis wirkt so lange, ich bin teilweise Abends draufgekommen, dass ich meine Dosis in der Früh noch garnicht genommen hatte. Du kannst auspennen, musst nicht diese Prozedur (ich weiß, das IV Ritual hat auch was schönes, aber wenn man es jeden Tag macht geht das auch verloren und nervt nur noch) jeden Morgen machen.  


Ganz abgesehen von der Gesundheit. Selbst wenn man Mikrofiltert, man merkt einfach, dass so hohe Dosen Morphin auf den Körper gehen. Aufs Herz, auf die Lungen. Histaminreaktion auch nicht zu unterschätzen. Und das alles nur, für einen Flash der paar minuten dauert aber schon lange nicht mehr so gut ist, wie am anfang.

&amp;#x200B;

Brauchst bei 600mg auch keine Angst haben, dass es zu wenig ist. Nach 2-3 Tagen oral retardiert nehmen hast du diesen konstanten Pegel.  
Und wenn du iwann bereit bist, abzudosieren, ist es wirklich nicht schwer. Bis 200-300mg spürte ich die 40mg weniger / Monat garnicht, ab 200mg dezent, aber weil du dich im Leben auf andere Sachen konzentrierst, und nichtmehr 24/7 an Drogen denkst ist das leicht zu verkraften und weit entfernt von schweren Enzugserscheinungen.

Wenn du richtung null gehst, sprich 100-60mg, bist du quasi auf null. Wenn du auf 60mg runter bist ist der Schritt auf null nicht spürbar.

&amp;#x200B;

Hängt natürlich alles davon ab, wie du im Leben stehst, ob du dich inzwischen von dem Drogenumfeld etc. gelöst hast, ob du Struktur im Leben hast (Job, Hobby, ...) und ein Opiatfreies Leben anstrebst.

&amp;#x200B;

Die schwierige Aufgabe beginnt, wie auch nach jedem kalten Enzug, erst wenn man gegen Null ist und die Opiate wieder ""wirken"", also dieses Opiatgefühl, das man vom Anfang, als man begonnen hat mit Opiaten, noch kennt.  
Ich war zB schon auf 60mg, keinerlei Craving nach Opiaten. Dann kam eine Depression, und ich kam an Oxycodon, das ich zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nie konsumiert hatte. War neugierig und dachte mir ""naja Oxy musst jetz schon probieren"" und wie gesagt kam die schöne Opiatwirkung wieder.

Habe dann meine 60mg entretardiert genommen und den gleichen effekt, ein schönes Opiatgefühl, wieder. Lwtztendlich musste ich wieder aufdosieren und kam so langsam wieder auf 400mg. Und das ist jetz wieder eine Dosis, die mich so sättigt, dass ich von höheren Dosen kein besseres Gefühl bekomme, nein ich werde nur müde und mir wird n bisschen schlecht.

&amp;#x200B;

Aber das abdosieren fällt mir jetzt schwerer, da ich Versagensangst habe.  


Egal, bin etwas abgeschweift, im Grunde will ich nur sagen: Nimm es Oral, retardiert am besten, damit es nurmehr ein Medikament für dich ist. Sei ehrlich, der Flash vom Morph ist schon lange nichtmehr geil. Und der Grund warum du immer noch craving hast, ist weil du keinen konstanten Spiegel hast, sondern dir morgens einen Knaller machst, der aber gegen Abends nachlässt. Das veranlasst einen übrigens auch, dann andere Sachen zu nehmen wie Benzos oder Kokain IV, einfach weil man iwas haben will. Aber auch das geht weg wenn man konstant Opiat-gesättigt ist.",1

Moçambique é atualmente um dos maiores corredores de droga do mundo. 

A droga, proveniente do Afeganistão, entra por via marítima no Norte, (é descarregada por Dhows a 20km da costa e trazida para terra por embarcações de pequeno porte). A droga entra no país nomeadamente na região entre Palma e Pemba (zona afetada pelos insurgentes). Estima-se que passam pelo país, 40 toneladas de heroina por ano (~800M€). (Estimativa baseada só nos Dhows, não contabiliza a droga que chega via contentores)

132,2021-03-16 17:13:25+00:00,"I mean not to sound like  a dick, but this is a complete misunderstanding of the issue. Here is what I say:

The two biggest causes of death from drugs are overdose and taking chemicals that are not what they say they are. 

1) Overdoes is often because the user simply doesn't know  what the dosage is.  This problem would be completely avoided with legalization. If the user actually knows the dosage overdose is much less likely to happen. 

2) If chemicals/drugs are regulated then manufactures are going to be regulated. This will mean that drugs you buy are the drugs that they claim to be. Many deaths of users are because drugs that would normally pretty harmless (LSD for example), are much more toxic drugs like NBOME. This also works for drugs like heroin, which are often unpure and mixed with much more dangerous drugs like fentayl. 

The only way forward is through legalization.",1

Maybe you should consider the fact that I almost never watch fox and that it is just a common sense question.

Maybe you missed my points, so I will make them more clear. My points are the ones that are industibutable facts, which is why I am asking about it since it has piled up.
1. Immigrants coming here illegally are not all violent gang members, but enough are that it is completely irrational to not just use legal means.
2. Children and hostage family members are being trafficked for drug or sex purposes. This isn't disputable, just solidified fact.
3. Illegal immigrants, as opposed to legal, are much more likely to be homeless or on welfare while they are not paying taxes, for at least some time, creating an unnecessary burden at a time when we are not supporting our OWN welfare/homeless people.
4. Drug cartels are extremely dangerous. Even 2% (example) coming in here illegally is completely unnecessary. You are focused on the fact that a majority are not drug dealers, most likely, and that is most likely true. But why in the wide wide world of sports would you bring more drug cartel members over than you would normally, especially since families are being taken hostage.
Here in Indiana (Texas not my governor), a Mexican cartel was just proven to have taken a guy's family hostage. They said for him to sell their drugs or they would murder his family. Illegal guy's were coming to give drugs for him to sell.


All this is not rocket science, just common knowledge. My question is why, when democrats want to do well with immigrants (as do I), they would allow an INCREASE in such events, MORE incentive for such events to take place, all in the name of ""helping""

I can make this even simpler for you. Let's say I let 10 people in my house every year, but I have standards and ways to screen people. 1 of those people, turns out, lied for my standards and I missed it (the real numbers are less than 10%).
Well, after a while, I want to help more, so I get rid of most screening and allow 30 people. I was already allowing more people into my home than any other person in my neighborhood (world), even though my own family was having problems I could not or was unable to support. Now, I have 30 or more people coming in my home, but 5-7 are hiding drugs in here, and a couple are in my attic and I cannot get them out because it's dark. One even tried to take my daughter by selling her heroine laced with fentanol.

Do you understand yet? I highly doubt your house is without a lock. I HIGHLY doubt you allow people to come into your home and stay, no matter who they are.

The border stuff is causing chaos, not order. That is straight-up fact. Why go for chaos and not order?",1

Heroin in a drug store that is regulated by the FDA is much safer than heroin from some dude on the street.

Shooting up in bathrooms, hiding from your family, re-using needles because you don't have access to clean ones, buying heroin laced with fetanyl, going to jail, these are all bad things. Even if you are morally opposed to drug use or have no interest in helping addicts, these are all things that we should look to eliminate because of their cost to society. Legalizing and regulating drugs seems to be a smart way to effectively treat addicts at the same time lessening the burden on both them and society.

You also bring up a good point with the discussion that kids are doing harder shit like pills &amp; opiates. But i must counter it with how addictive robotablets truly are and how easy it is to get addicted to them. Kids will be charged way more expensive prices for opiates vs a 20$ bottle of 100 pills that they only need to take 10 of to be absolutely fucked. The fact that theres so many in 1 bottle to be obtained thru a single purchase gateways the bingeing of them very easily for a susceptible brain like a minors. While i agree opiates are more dangerous due to fetanyl and higher od rates, dxm is not many tiers below opiates in terms of addictive properties and danger. 

As for an enforced ID encouraging shoplifting, lets be real, kids who are grimey/fucked up enough to want to do dxm, are not gonna pay for it in the firstplace. Theyre gonna shoplift it either way.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

215,2021-03-12 13:57:24+00:00,"I think a lot of the medicine industry is driven solely by money; there are definitely life-saving treatments by solid companies out there, but big pharma funds most of the research to make sure doctors prescribe their drugs. Like OxyCotin funding research that says we are *underprescribing* pain meds, so that doctors start prescribing more. This has led to an opioid crisis in America. Big pharma also makes sure most plant based medicines stay illegal through lobbying (even when they may be more effective for treatment) because they want to make money from patents.

Curing patients is not a sustainable business model, so that has led to a money-driven research in that field.

That's just one example of a legitimate conspiracy in my eyes.

I was trying to detox from 16mgs subutex per day too, which is a heavy dose.

My milk came in around the same time as my first, but we had a few supply issues combined with jaundice that meant I was triple feeding for a few weeks (breastfeeding, then pumping and feeding pumped milk from a bottle, then topping up with formula). As soon as she hit her birth weight again, we stopped with formula and she breast fed until 16 months without issue.

She has no allergies (that we know of) and she's almost 2 and a half.

The first night she did bring up a bit of fluid that they said wasn't 'squeezed' out of her (as it were) so my recommendation is to get them weighed and compared to her birth weight before you leave the hospital, as she was probably bringing up a bit of milk with it too. After the first night, she wasnt bringing up fluid. She's not any chestier than her big sister.

I'm also already booked in for another c section with my third due in June! I could have opted for a VBAC but because of the shoulder dystocia, the size of my second (she was 9lbs 2oz), and blood loss during the c section (which also affected my milk production, as did an infection in my stitches), we decided another c section was the safest route.",1

I didn't see him swallow a baggie of fent though, it would be interesting to see if someone's got a timestamp on that.

Answer: ODMST has been the toughest and then Etizolam is the runner up (note: I am prescribed a benzo which I take consistently and the way Im supposed to so that has made the come down from Etiz easier for me. Also, Ive read that 1mg of Etiz is like as fourth as powerful as 1mg of Klonopin, aka I believe Etizolam is overall, a weaker benzo (I know its technically a thienotriazolodiazepine). 

ODSMT has affected me about the same way as Tramadol (although its a bit weaker).

I took tramadol every day for a few years during grad school and I loved it because it of course relaxed me, it was actually a bit of an appetite suppressant, it helped me block out painful memories (PTSD), and (Im sure other people have experienced this), it gave me energy both mentally and physically. 

Some people might say that I felt like I had more energy because I was happier/less depressed, which could be true. However, Ive tried literally every opiate under the sun and while I enjoyed many of them (hydrocodone was actually preferable to oxycodon or morphine for some reason) and none of them gave me energy. 

Ive been addicted to opiodes and benzos for about ten years (jesus christ) and Ive withdrawn countless times both on my own and while in in-patient and the withdrawal from benzos is waaaaaaay more painful and drawn out. This isn't everyone's experience obviously and I know many would disagree and thats fine, understandable.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Al doilea rand, sunt niste emo. Marea majoritate a muzicii rap este despre tristete. Nu exista melodie rap sa o pui intr-un club si sa se simta lumea bine pe ea.

323,2021-03-04 22:02:49+00:00," A vida anda difícil para qualquer pessoa que tenha pelo menos um mindinho fincado na realidade. Presos numa reprise macabra de 2020, tudo parece uma consequência de dois problemas: a nossa dessensibilização e a aversão à realidade. 

 É preciso algum grau de insensibilidade para sobreviver num país como o nosso. Alguns passos nas calçadas das grandes cidades e, mantida a nossa humanidade no seu mais alto grau, choraríamos de desespero. Nossos olhos se acostumaram ao absurdo, mas, em algum momento, nós perdemos o pé: [1.840 mortos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2021/03/brasil-registra-mais-de-1700-mortes-em-24h-e-bate-novo-recorde-diario-e-de-media-movel-de-obitos.shtml) num só dia, e uma parte de nós segue fingindo que o problema não é o vírus, mas as medidas de contenção.

 O Congresso que se organiza rapidamente para defender os [próprios interesses](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/02/apos-caso-silveira-lira-acelera-pec-para-aumentar-imunidade-parlamentar-e-gera-criticas-por-atropelo.shtml) segue omisso nas providências em relação ao maior dos negacionistas: o presidente. Não faço parte do grupo que condena sem possibilidade de perdão quem ajudou a eleger Bolsonaro. Foi preciso fechar os olhos para suas declarações de admiração [por torturadores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml), seu desejo pelo [fuzilamento ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/brasil/fc3012199902.htm)de adversários políticos, seu projeto de Brasil de ""[matar uns 30 mil""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/06/nos-anos-90-bolsonaro-defendeu-novo-golpe-militar-e-guerra.shtml), mas, se naquela época era possível dizer que estávamos no campo da retórica, agora temos vítimas reais: mil setecentas e vinte e seis. Um dia. 

 Vargas Llosa escreveu que a fantasia humana é um dom demoníaco. Deve ser. Temos vivido num estado de delírio coletivo, e não se chega a esse estado de uma hora para a outra. Foram 500 anos construindo a nossa capacidade de conviver com o horror, e a nossa história nos convenceu de que, na ausência de um pensamento republicano, a alternativa era o salve-se quem puder. E, assim, egocêntricos e individualistas, aprofundamos o nosso abismo traumatizados pelo descaso, pela violência e pelo abandono.

 Em vez de negar a realidade com a fantasia, poderíamos usar a fantasia para construir a realidade. O brasileiro se acostumou a pensar sobre si como um povo alegre, sensível, solidário, gentil. É hora de nos transformarmos nesse desejo.

Vestal would definietly raise them to be a faithful fellow, who spends a lot of time in the church. Might raise another Crusader.

Plague Doctor, is a horrible choice. She doesnt care about anyone or anything, other than herself and her research. But miracles exist, so she might change her twisted mind, once she would give birth to her own. Than that child would probably become a doctor as well.

Its like some drug cartels are state approved and some arent, but only because the approved ones are helping you with their mood and erection enhancing blockbuster drugs and the illegal ones are just out to get you hooked and make a quick buck at your expense.    And never did I see that line blur more than after the Purdue oxycotin blow-up.

Yes, I know im oversimplifying, but you are making a really good point.  The line I heard from big pharma was that ""we are helping patients become aware of our drugs as options for treating their condition"".  As if big pharma wasnt doing enough already by plying the doctors and their staff with free food and goodies (not to mention tons of other dubious stuff like speaking opurtunities, etc.) to get them to hear the sales pitches, they need to make sure the doctors hear about it from the patients too.",1

Now maybe I just have a really sensitive cervix, or because of my history with terrible cramps/possible endo?? It may have made that experience harder on me compared to all the other women who say they barely felt anything. 

It hurt, but it only lasted less than 2 minutes and once it was over and everything was out of me, the pain was instantly relieved. The cramps did make me throw up but they gave me a nausea pill and crackers and a heating pad. I feel much better than I did 15 minutes ago.

Good luck! I have a feeling it won’t hurt as much for you since it seems to be a smaller number of women reporting a lot of pain. Everyone there will be very kind and helpful and attentive. It’ll be over before you know it! 💗💗💗",2

To my mind, 'recreational' is 'you don't need it, but you enjoy it.'

I need it, but I don't enjoy is in and of itself, the way you might both need and enjoy morphene after surgery, then not 'need' it, but still enjoy it, after you've recovered.  Leaving alone the whole 'addiction means you need it' part.",1
