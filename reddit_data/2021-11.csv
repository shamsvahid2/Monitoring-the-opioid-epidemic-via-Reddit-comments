Oh fuck lmao sorry, yes weeks

It’s incredible how right you are, that is exactly how my emotions are going right now, so far this morning I’m on some kind of crazy coffee and hormonal ride and I feel amazingly motivated and kinda shit

And given the last few days, I fully expect to be sobbing in the shower by 6 pm

It’s absolutely fucking insane, I’m generally stoic as hell, and can take pain but I was actually fucking passing out during ultrasound 2, they offered me IV mophine a few hours later, but by then I was already almost asleep and the pain had lessened so I refused 

It’s fucking crazy about the people who were and weren’t willing to help and talk - very accurate and very surprising


Thank you for your response my guy, I wish you the absolute best with everything 

The big decisions thing, fuck. I’ve gone through so many fucking crazy schemes in my head the past few days, and only the fear of psychiatric hospitalization or worse repercussions has kept me in check, but I think (hope) I’m past the “seriously considering faking my death” stage",1

3,2021-11-30 14:25:42+00:00,"There's an episode of Chicago Med with an OBGYN using drugs ""safely"" at an underground clinic.

Would you feel comfortable with your doctor being a recreational user of a drug so addictive that ""recreational use"" is actually daily?

The problem that the legalization folks don't tend to want to deal with is that there are people who can't use in moderation and there are drugs that can't be taken in moderation. So what then? Do we legalize something that people wouldn't try if it wasn't legal?

I gave birth 3 months ago and was given 800mg of Motrin in the hospital for my pain. It worked fine, but one of my doctors still sent me home with 20 Oxycotin pills? Why would I need more pain relief at home than I was receiving in the hospital? It made no sense especially because I took regular OTC ibuprofen instead when I got home and was fine.

I'm all in favor of decriminalizing drug use in favor of social programs that say keep people safe and alive. But the goal should be to discourage drug use because sitting on a sofa blazed out of your mind because you hate your life is destructive to society. I have enough trouble trying to convince my non-drug using husband that he's rotting away in front of the television.",-10

About a month before surgery I had to urinate about every 30 minutes and I was having difficulty emptying my bladder. I was not sleeping and about to loose my sanity from pain and lack of sleep. I had to have an indwelling catheter for a month prior to my surgery. I was able to get some sleep but when I awake my pain was still just as excruciating with the catheter.                                   I was taking 4 perocet (10-325) every 8 hours, 6 mg of tizadine 3 times a day, 100 mg of trazadone at bed time, and 50 mg of Atarax at bed time. I was still crying from the pain. I had already stopped the elmiron because it didn't help and I lost a lot of hair. I couldn't use any installations because I had blood and long stringy blood clots in my urine.

After I got over the surgical pain I weaned my self off the pains meds  (not cold turkey) and all the other IC medications before my 2 month follow up my urologist. He was pleasantly surprised and happy I was able to do without assistance / medical intervention. My primary MD was shocked I was able to come off the pains. She express her concerns numerous times I was going to get addicted to the perocet.  I have NO pelvic pain anymore. I still get the occasional sensation I need to urinate but NO pain. I have passed numerous kidney stones 6 mm and under and numerous surgeries / ureteroscopies to remove stones from kidneys and ureters greater than 6 mm and 2 lithotripsies. The pain from a kidney stone was a nothing compared to IC pain and I am so relieved to be free of that unbearable pain. Fyi I am 53 and have other auto immune and health conditions.

Siempre trato de ser los más diplomática posible, pero siempre están los que asocian feminista=feminazi. Es repugnante, esa gente esta comparando al feminismo con un movimiento antisemita, racista y homofobico que asesino a millones.

Y en lo personal las detesto, pq se llaman feministas y hacen un montón de ruido y cagan el movimiento para las demás.

Took 2 hours for them to get me checked in. Then they gave me some kind of mussel relaxant which did squat. Sat there in miserable agony for another 7 hours until they got me back for an ultrasound. Then the dr. was like, here’s a bit of morpheme to help with the pain. Go home and pass it. Morpheme barely helped. Got home and spent the next day and a half in and out of pain as it slowly moved. I ate more gummies in that time frame than I ever have before and let me tell you, they helped better than the morphene and I will literally always keep one on me just in case this ever happens again. 0/10 would not fucking recommend to anyone.

I’m on a low dose too (compared to the average). I have a higher amphetamine concentration than him. He had more norfetanyl than fentanyl on his body. Norfetanyl is a metabolic product of fetanyl breakdown, converted at a 1:1 ratio (approximately). This shows that most of the fetanyl had broken down at time of death. It doesn’t make sense for overdose being chase of death, as fetanyl slows down autonomic nervous function causing death (people breathing too slow, heart too slow, etc). If this was the case, he would have died earlier, as the effect would have been stronger with higher fetanyl dosages. Additionally fetanyl kills by slowing breathing and heart rate down. People don’t struggle, they go to sleep and never wake up. Maybe vomit on themselves and die of aspiration. None of that seems consistent with his death. Do you have any evidence that points to it being a drug overdose? The ME specifically said “cardiac arrest following law enforcement restraint”",12

Luckily for me i never developer a habit.   Always used BTH like alcohol. Once a week.on my day off to relax.  So i just try to make settle hints to friends of friends seeing if they know a guy. 

The drug.is vilified so cant just ask any friend, cousin etc.....gotta seek out the drug.users and than somehow ask for a connect without being judged

But yea.  Fent high I just dont like.  Too drowsy. Also when I did get the ""nod"" I couldnt even enjoy it Cause.im thinking i possibly OD and purposely stay awake cause.im to scared to close my eyes or lay down.  

So 2 options on fent.alone.  chip away and only get a buzz which sucks...causr again....i just get drowsy and sluggish.   Or get the right dose to achieve an actual high BUT how do I know if i did too much or not.....therefor I cant actually enjoy it.  


Option 3 is have my sis (who knows I smoke and approves/doesnt judge) to overlook with narcan so I can enjoy the nod.....but my habitual routine was smoke BTH alone have a nice toke....take a hit....watch a peaceful movie.  Take another hit....n just be in my zen mode.  


BTH i was more into the ritual of smoking.  Same as people.who are addicted to the routine of smoking a cig


Whats funny.is.  after I snort.  Ill smoke a stogey. Cause.it mimicks me smoking BTH.  But its just not the same.  


For short term goal. Is just.get my lazy ass to use the dark web 

Long term hunt.   Ill find it when i find it type of thing.  


Any way its better off i do the long hunting game. Goves me brain a big break from it.  Even doing just once a week im more than sure.my dopamin receptors are slightly adulterated and damaged.  So let thy brain heal.   Cause I threw away my pills.  

Today I did a full drug.screen.  and not a SINGLE opiate popped positive.  The ONLY thing I couldnt get my hands on was fent strips.  

But did a full opiate/opioid drug screen via piss and im negative on every single.perscription/illicit drug.  Which means the pills I got is straight fillers.....bunk....and fentynyl.  


So too dangerous.  And LUCKILY since my dumbass did do 2 pills the first day I got it and didnt OD.    Thank god! Should have tested before.   And texted all and any noobies/friends who bought these pressed Oxy who NEVER done H or any strong opiates besides perscription Oxy time to time and told them NOT TO TAKE IT.  

Or at least have me present with narcan! Dont drink.  No benzos.  Etc........cause these dangerous pills will get them killed.

27,2021-11-29 17:32:34+00:00,"""Fun"" little fact:

During the earlier phase of the oxycotin over-prescription debacle in the US, some minority groups were statistically less affected because of greater hesitancy by medical professionals to prescribe legal opiates. 

The leading hypothesis is that said groups were perceived as more prone to opiate abuse, so their access to a legal supply was more sparse. Of course, after a while the disparity completely disappeared because the illegal supply increased to meet the unmet demand.

I still think that legalisation and taxation across the board, along with the treatment of substance abuse/ addiction as a public health matter, would enable for way better outcomes. We already know ""cold turkey"" treatments are not effective, we're wasting resources and time on adults deciding to smoke meth on a Friday night rather than allocating those resources to solve thefts/sexual assaults/murders/etc.

The sooner we start treating people like adults, and hold them to it, the sooner we'll come out of this pit we dug ourselves into when it comes to drugs.

The initial shock might be hella brutal, but the medium- to long-term will see net gains. Hell, might even be able to abolish the income taxes if we replace them with taxes that reflect your consumption (smokers, drug users, alcohol drinkers, added sugar consumers would pay more into the system because they're more likely to have a need for it)

Well... the ""straight bupe"" is what its called now. I started on suboxone all those years ago. Lots of research went into the medications on my side over the past decade and a half of being on it. Judge me if you may, but its saved my life and i see no reason to quit at this point...

But back to topic. Research. I learned that the naloxone active in suboxone is actually pretty much inert. Ive seen junkies straight up inject suboxone without any interference, if they were actualy in PAWS. Saying that. Ive also seen junkies pop a subutex when not in PAWS.... and 30 mins later, they were in the worst PAWS they had ever experienced. Why? Why can the drug without naloxone promote withdraw effects? Well... because the naloxone is inert. It has no pull on anything other than for me, side effects...

The mechanism at work here is binding affinty. Buprenorphine has close to the most binding affinity of any opiate known to science. It will even kick a heavy dose of fentenyl off mu opiod receptors. This is the mechanism also which prevents people from getting analgesic effects from full opiate agonists.  Its not the naloxone at all. Once buprenorphine is bonded with a receptor, nithing can kick it off... outside of MAYBE sufetenyl. Which isnt readily available. This is also causing some issues in the emergency and operating rooms across the world, and what i see to be a very concerning one. If i were to have an accident,  chances are id have to tough out the pain, have a spinal, or be administered ketamine for pain management.  

So, just wanted to say, the naloxone was prly put in there as a sales pitch and patent note for big pharma. It does nothing. And me taking subutex has no ploy on my 15 years of sobriety.",1

Was pretty discounted so I thought I'd see what's up.

It has all the Kojima weirdness alright.  I like that there's a character named Die-Hardman and he wears a skull mask, but everybody pronounces it ""Diehardmin"" like it's a regular name.  And instead of being some hardcore soldier archetype, he's a political advisor.  I'm only in chapter 3, I really hope I never get an explanation for any part of his deal.  It's better if there's no explanation and nobody ever comments on it at all.

I was hurt by the revelation that Sam Porter Bridges changed his name to that.  I really needed the porter carrying packages and building bridges to just coincidentally be named Porter Bridges.  ""Porter is my middle name"" he should have constantly said, but tragically didn't.

I'm kinda miffed that I have a bike already.  I was promised a walking simulator, not a tricycle simulator!  

I'm sure the whole ""did you know in English, stand means part of a rope, something that binds things together, but it also means behind separated or stuck?"" is more cerebral in Japanese than it is in English.  Because yes I did know those meanings, thanks Mr. Diehardmin.  Did YOU know that cleave means to hold to or to cut off?  Those are opposites!  It's called an autoantonym.  Strand isn't really one, though.  It's actually fairly consistent.  It's only a strand of hair or rope when it's been separated from the rest.

Overall I'm enjoying it for some reason.  Phenomenal atmosphere.  Great sound design.  You can really feel the ropes tightening and the frames bending whenever you move with an absurd number of Amazon boxes Bungie corded to your arms, legs, and back.  Which is always.  The packages must flow.  

The currency is likes, which give you an oxycotin boost when you get them.   That's certainly commentary on something.  I know it's to prevent toxicity in a post apocalyptic world, but why can't I dislike the damn package thieves?  Bring back downvotes!",9

Did his pain go away or did he have chronic pain?

Often what sets people down this road is that modern medicine can barely do shit for chronic pain, so the doctors give stuff that is potent but works in the beginning but eventually the pain doesn't stop and they don't have any other options so they stop writing prescriptions for things like opioids.

Only, for the patient the pain hasn't gone away so they turn to street drugs. In these types of cases its the ""anti-addiction safeguards"" that are causing people to OD. In theory if the doctors kept prescribing and monitoring usage there is no reason why it would be unsafe for a patient to be on them indefinitely for years.

On the other end of the spectrum you have people who get exposure to something like fentanyl in a clinical setting and think ""wow this is amazing I need more of it"" and go straight to the recreational use without any chronic pain problems. I have had almost a dozen surgeries and my spine is so fucked I am in severe pain every day and will be for life. When I was on opiods I never got any kind of high or euphoria from it. It was straight up dull headache, epic constipation, and pain relief. Fentayl was worse, it felt straight up like I was legit dying. Terrible experience and it was so bad I actually preferred the pain over more. Now my best friend from K-12, he has medical problems and was given fentanyl once in a clinical setting and immediately had sky high euphoria and ""this is the best moment of my life!"" type feeling and would be hooked if he were dumb enough to seek it out recreationally &amp; he knows it.

Science can't explain why he had his reaction and I had mine. Some people are just predisposed to crave it, or that's my theory anyway.",4

If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Codones aren’t even that hard to find if that’s the game you’re in, their expensive to be sure, even if they weren’t, if you’ve started using heroin, you’re never going back, period. 

I think you would agree that the government is never going to legalize fentanyl or hydro morphine/morphone, or any substance that is stronger or equal in strength to that as heroin, so I assume you’re on board with legalizing other prescription opiates that are significantly less potent, and in your mind that alleviates the demand for fentanyl you spoke of. That’s not going to work for the people over dosing on fentanyl laced heroin, as I previously mentioned.

Unless you want some story about how crazy the medical science world is that could refute their claims. (Look up perdue pharma and oxycotin if you're interested in that). We should also know that science isn't always 100 percent accurate as it's every learning and newer tech comes out to assist in that learning. Also science is directed by humans and we are not free of corruption.

Personally, I feel like a real middle grounder in this instance, because if an anti-vaccine person says ""what about the long term side effects!"" I think about the fact that we don't know the same for catching covid. But in that same sense, when someone says ""they say it's effective get it!"" I think, well what's the context of ""effective""? Because most of the vaccines we have to get we only get once, or only need a booster every so many [years](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html). These are every so months or so.   


At the end of the day people take in all that and make their decisions.  In part, that's how they decide to call it effective. They take in the information they gathered, weighed it in a cost versus benefits sense, and then moved forward.",1

Phenibut has an very intense effect on me. 2 grams is around 9-12 beers in intensity but way more euphoric and nice overall. No side effects, yet extreme disinhibition, sedation, stimulation and euphoria. Sometimes double vision and a little hard to talk.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

I'm no stranger to chronic pain, and for a long time did use Kratom for that instead of prescriptions.

If you're already on oxycodone (active opioid in percocet) it's not likely Kratom will equate the same relief as the medication, but it's certainly better than nothing. Just want to accurately set your expectations. Kratom works for many but usually people already on opioid pain relief find it insufficient for analgesic relief due to the tolerance (as well as expectations).

If you're still in pain with oxy, your dose either needs to be upped or increased in frequency, but good luck telling some doctors that, just depends on your ""luck of the draw"" and how you communicate your needs with them. Some won't budge no matter how much pain or discomfort you're in.

I'm a chronic pain sufferer myself, but one that has actively refused going back to full mu-opioid agonists (like oxy, hydrocodone or morphone, etc) because of addiction, and have instead settled on buprenorphine for both the pain relief as well as the addiction temptation/relief.

I don't know the right answer for you, but personally I'll answer your questions here:

* I preferred powder to capsules because it hit quicker but tasted like dirt and shit -- chug it shaken with cold water with an OJ or acidic drink to increase absorption and effectiveness -- if you find you require a bigger dose, or easier dosing: pills would be the way to go but take a bit longer to hit and isn't as ""intense""
* Recommended dosage: it depends -- but if you start low you can always increase and take more. (some start as low as a single gram, others are at 4-5, some are 10+) Take too much and you'll know it -- nausea, the spins, vomiting, double vision, shaking -- stuff like that will happen in my experience. Increase slowly and look for side effects or when your pain is relieved to an adequate level without the kratom side effects of taking too much. Can sometimes seem like threading a needle.

I hope that helps, good luck man! From one chronic pain ""experience-r"" to another.",1

Not too young but too young to be a single mom. I had my son at 21. I think he would be proud to see the impact on me. I never did drugs around my son, made excuses for doing it at parties and raves.

214,2021-11-23 01:06:10+00:00,"wikipedia citing Bond, Helen K. (1998). Pontius Pilate in History and Interpretation. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-63114-9. for a ""500 strong cohort"" as mentioned in John 18:3.

The word used is σπεῖραν (speiran). Strong's Greek Concordance defines it as: *cohort, the tenth part of a legion; a military guard.*

You can arguably read it either way, I think, based on the [Thayer's Greek entry](https://biblehub.com/greek/4686.htm):

&gt;**a military cohort** (Polybius 11, 23, 1 τρεῖς σπείρας. τοῦτο δέ καλεῖται τό σύνταγμα τῶν πεζῶν παρά Ῥωμαίοις κωρτις), **i. e. the tenth part of a legion (i. e. about 600 men (i. e. legionaries), or if auxilialies either 500 or 1,000; cf. Marquardt, Römisch.** Alterth. III. ii., p. 371. But surely τοῦτο τό σύνταγμα in the quotation comprehends the τρεῖς σπεῖρα; hence, **Polybius here makes a σπεῖρα equal to a maniple,** cf. 2, 3, 2; 6, 24, 5; cf. Zonaras, Lex., p. 1664, σπεῖρα σύνταγμα διακοσίων ἀνδρῶν.  
&gt;  
&gt;**On the other hand, ""the later Greek writings almost uniformly employ σπεῖρα as the representative of cohors""** (Smith, Dict. of Antiq., edition 2, under the word exercitus, p. 500); and the rise of χιλίαρχος (which was the equivalent of tribunus, the commander of a cohort) in connection with it (John 18:12; Acts 21:31), together with the uniform rendering of the word by cohors in the Latin versions, warrants the margin cohort uniformly added in R. V. to the rendering band): Matthew 27:27; Mark 15:16; Acts 10:1; Acts 21:31; Acts 27:1, and often in Josephus; **a maniple, or the thirtieth part of a legion, often so in Polybius ((see above)); any band, company, or detachment, of soldiers (2 Macc. 8:23; Judith 14:11): John 18:3, 12.**

So 500 is there? Then a maniple is about 120 soldiers [altogether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniple_(military_unit)).

So the word usually either means ""cohort"" which would be like, 500 men, sometimes it's used to equal a maniple, which is about 120 men, and possibly it can just mean ""any company or whatever who knows.""

still, modern military numbers often hew close to roman ones and if a company of today is anything like a roman one, that's still a range of 80-250 people.

I don't know anything about ancient Greek tbh. It's either that they used a word that usually means somewhere between 120-500 men to just mean ""a whole lot of soldiers"" or they really did send out a ton of soldiers and not all of them were in Gethsemane itself.

Which, given everything else I quoted when someone asked for my Pilate sources, I'll say ""split the difference.""

It may not have *literally* been 500 men, as the word implies, but the fact that there were probably way more soldiers sent than reasonably necessary is probably not just outright fabrication, because Pilate send out a ton of soldiers to go suppress riots or kill people other times too.

and re: John, that's also the last of the books written, isn't it? Mark, by contrast, is the oldest, and shows Pilate more willing to punish. The narrative details change with time progression, which indicates there was a reason for christians to want to reframe Pilate.

...I did just try to google map the route walking. Looks like under two hours if I located the right places and you walked straight from one to the other (only one time each) so while it is a ridiculous absurdity of trotting him around the city, it's probably doable. longer if you retrace steps and return to places.

anyways basically the only reliable historical thing I can glean here is ""pilate ordered his crucifixion. and a load of other people's. Rome was pretty fond of crucifying Jews, actually, if we're to believe [Josephus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/war-2.html), the Roman Governor Varus had ***2,000*** people crucified:

&gt;...but Varus sent a part of his army into the country, against those that had been the authors of this commotion, and as they caught great numbers of them, **those that appeared to have been the least concerned in these tumults he put into custody, but such as were the most guilty he crucified; these were in number about two thousand.**

honestly given that it's most likely none of the gospel writers were actually there for this petitioning of pilate, I assume all of the specific details of conversation are fictionalized beyond the sentencing and execution, and perhaps that the temple priests thought he was nothing but trouble and a threat to their power.",2

222,2021-11-22 18:33:42+00:00,"I had my GRS / penile inversion vaginoplasty on the 13th with Bellringer. 

Referred by NHS and once I had seen Bellringer it was 6 months for the op. They told me about a month before and had to attend a pre op about 2 weeks before.

Stopped Estradot 4 weeks prior to op and it has been an absolute nightmare of hot flushes and crying.

Made sure you take decent ear plugs ! If you get a room on floor two on left as you edit the life without air con the window opens to the first floor roof with all the fans making a proper racket and it way way to hot for me / soaked with sweat while stuck in bed is not nice.

I had serious pain issues after the spinal block wore off and ended up having a panic attack (only the second one I had ever had). Ended up on oxygen and morphene and it ran out just before the pressure bandage was removed. I think I'm traumatised from that part to be honest. 

Nobody took any notice of me saying I was in almost constant pain which I assumed was the stitches (wish I know what I know now) and said I couldn't have anything other than paracetamol and ibuprofen, it was a #_&amp;&amp;£## joke and I cried all the next night unable to sleep for due the pain. I then slept most of the day once they started giving me paracetamol  ibuprofen etc as I was shattered.

Started throwing up the next day and couldn't eat or drink. On anti sickness meds but nothing for pain.

The final straw was that night laying awake in pain at 2am and the nurse opened my door and left so quickly that I didn't have time to say anything. Got out of bed and found my monitoring rounds sheet next to my door and it noted pain level 0. Well I hit the fucking roof, nurse said I couldn't have anything for pain, I just shut down at this point trying to control my breathing and she called the doctor. He said the same thing on entering the room but once he seem me he prescribed sleeping pills. I was out of it within 20 minutes. Waking every hour or so sweating profusely but able to go back to sleep.

The rest of the time was relatively uneventful. Pain all day then basically sedated at night.

I spoke with another girl while there and she has virtually no pain so I may be the exception but all I know is that it was the most painful stressful upsetting time in my life and I'm over 40 ! 

Still in pain now but figured out the main pain is double groin strain, ice helps as do proper pain killers. Taking laxatives to ensure I do not get constipated. Can hardly walk, can't close my thighs together, can't sleep as Nytol is crap compared to what they have me.

I'm an absolute mess but managing to dilate but believe me it's not 20 minutes ! By the time you get everything ready then relax then manage to get the smallest orange one in for 20 minutes then the Violet one takes 15 minutes to get to dot 4... Yey success... Then douche 🤢 then shower trying to clean it without touching it because you are terrified of that pain... Set aside an hour at least.

Can't fault the work Bellringer did though. I have had no serious complications, it looks better than every image I can find of 1 week post op vaginoplasty. 

The nurses in general we really nice especially the one that sorted me out after the pressure bandage was removed.

The pain though FML. It's still hurting now and I am off my face on oromorph.

227,2021-11-22 17:04:14+00:00,"Honestly, in this case (from 2016 - assault was in 2015), I don't care too much about whether it's a hate crime or not. She did spend a little time in jail, just not as long as she would have if it were a hate crime.

In this case the judge accepted the defense's argument that she (it was a she - Tamara Crowchief) might have said it because she was ""complaining about her socio-economic status"", which seems a little weak and weird. Like, Jewish Canadians are high SES on average (literally the stats, plz no ban), but I don't think you can say ""I hate Jewish people"" and have it be not-a-hate-crime. Or maybe you can, if you say it because you're upset you're not as wealthy? Idk it verges into racial bias real fucking fast.

What I care about more: 

In the original 2015 assault, she was also in breach of conditions of her previous release from jail (I.e. she wasn't allowed to be out late and drunk, but she was). In the decision the judge noted her ""significant criminal record"" (at age 26!).

In 2017, she and a few friends were arrested on fetanyl &amp; meth-related charges...and ""All three had already been wanted for arrest in relation to various unrelated offences."" How do you rack up multiple offenses within months of getting out of jail?

https://chatnewstoday.ca/2017/11/11/three-blood-tribe-women-arrested-in-fentanyl-bust/

Not sure what happened in the years after, but fast forward to 2020 and she's arrested for a mugging/robbery of a senior. 

&gt; ""Tamara Dawn Crowchief, 29, was charged with robbery and was arrested on *13 outstanding warrants*.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/theft-assault-police-suspect-witness-1.5846283

Oh, I guess the years after were spent on picking up 13 warrants (plus whatever other shit she did).

Back in the 2016 case, the judge sentenced her to just pre-trial time served, and 12 months of probation. The judge gave her pre-trial time a 1.5x credit and refused a longer sentence, because:

- She was raised by her grandparents, who died in a car crash when she was 20 (which is given as a reason for why she starting committing crimes)

- She abused alcohol because of their deaths, so being drunk when she assaulted this lady isn't her fault, and somehow a mitigating factor.

- Half of her prior convictions were for breaching court orders, so they shouldn't count...although she also had 3 prior convictions for violence (so ""a period of incarceration is warranted"")

- She's a ""chronologically youthful"" offender, and therefore rehabilitation is a possibility.

So she gets out of jail on pre-time served, starts 12 months of probation, in which time she gets more warrants and is finally arrested, and then in the next few years gets more than a dozen more warrants before being arrested again.

I love rehabilitation. That's great. Love it. But you can't just let people out of jail and say ""go, start rehabilitating!"", and then be shocked when they keep doing what they were doing. I don't want a US-style 3-strikes thing, or 10 years on a pot charge. I want people to find a place in life where they're not randomly assaulting people. 

But if the alternative is just tiny stints in jail in between years of constant crime, without anything guiding them when they're out? Then fuck it, longer jail sentences. This hands-off bullshit (I.e. no real punishment or rehabilitation) doesn't help past and future victims, and it doesn't help the person themselves.",1

I guess the main Q to ask there then would be does it last significantly longer than and hit significantly harder than oxycontin when taken as prescribed orally?",1

Also have family members with opiate addiction of varying severity, one with the full on homeless break into your parent's house over and over and pawn everything life-wrecking tornado addiction.

You put words in my mouth.  I didn't say it was the same as herioin.  I correctly said that it is an opioid.  

I acknowledged the narcan and its mu receptor blocking effect, so I don't see why you would tell me something I already mentioned unless you didn't know it was narcan that blocked the Mu receptors?

The issue there is that the dose of narcan is there in a low enough ratio that you can indeed get high off of it.  If it was impossible to get high off of it, my beloved little junkie patients wouldn't try to cheek or spit out their suboxone and try to save it to later take several in one dose.  But they do.

The primary function of the narcan is to disincentivize going to your suboxone clinic, then going home and shooting up, just treating what you get at your clinic as a free add-on, something that is very practical to do if you are getting methadone.  Again, it's not much narcan at all, you could still get plenty high with heroin, it's just going to take a good bit more, which is going to make it a lot more expensive, and may provide a little bit more of a ""speed bump"" for the addict to pass over before they relapse.

Suboxone is an imperfect solution, better than nothing, but absolutely can get you high, it just it makes it a bit more expensive to do so.",1

The city has plans to create a multi-billion dollar expansion to the riverfront meanwhile ppl overdosing all around the downtown core.

We like to pretend as a city that there are not ppl sleeping on the streets and that there is just not enough help for those struggling with addiction. 
A safe injection site is not the answer to the problem here and neither is housing at the mission.

Attracting into the city and training of mental health professionals, addiction specialists, additional treatment centers and rehabilitation to get addicts clean and injected back into society.

We have an out of sight, out of mind mentality in our society where we say let them shoot up safely but not on my street. Or we say they are criminals lock them up to protect my family and if they overdose its unfortunate but what did they expect.

As a former addict myself I know I was lucky to become reformed and because I was in a healthy family situation with alot of support.
Those ppl living on Pelissier St behind the mission in tents every night are not so lucky.

Covid is not the health crisis that overdose and addiction is,, its really not even close when you look at the real effect it has on our society.
Addiction is generational and it effects whole families, it is stealing ppl away right in front of us and we are doing nothing.

273,2021-11-21 01:57:30+00:00,"I ruptured my spleen and had internal bleeding for 4 hours before getting to a hospital. Happened 20 years ago when I was 19. Snowboarding accident. Did about 3/4 back flip and landed on my head and scorpion-ed...my spleen was attached to my pelvis via adhesions from a previous surgery, so it literally ripped in half when I bent so far backwards. 

Mountain doctor/medics told me I had a broken rib and it was causing me the pain and difficulty breathing I was feeling. Told me it wasn't life threatening and to go home to a local hospital instead of going to ER ASAP...

Internal bleeding is an incredibly strange feeling. Immediately after I fell,  I pulled myself off the snow and I immediately started to sweat profusely, but managed to make it to the chair lift. I Immediately collapsed and laid in the snow trying to cool down. Was having a hard time breathing, then chills set in, followed by extreme nausea.

On the 3 hour drive back from the mountains, I continuously went through cycles of extreme sweating, chills, and pulling to the side of the road so I could vomit (unsuccessfully)...

Besides the blinding pain of an torn organ, blood filling the abdomen making hard to breath, and the absolutely odd physical sensations you feel, you are extremely confused as to where the pain is coming from.  The pain is hard to describe since it was hard know where it was originating, but it felt like war going on in my body. Sharp tweaks here and there, could feel pressure building in certain locations, couldn't breath, sweating fits, etc...It felt like my body was punching me, trying to get me to realize how bad this was.

I truly felt like a wimp for not being able to control the pain/symptoms I though were originating from a broken rib. I had no idea I was actively dying.

After 3 hours of this excruciating pain I got to my parents home and my mother described me as my whole body being ""grey"" so she immediately took me to the ER and they rushed me back to the critical care area. They gave me fentanyl and the pain immediately subsided...this was one of the craziest sensations I've ever had.  After 4 hours of hell, I felt the most AMAZING sense of relief the second the fentenyl hit my blood stream. Like mana from god, which probably has contributed to me being ""over-fond"" of painkillers. 

I could finally think again about something besides the pain and started to realize I was in really really bad shape. The nurse told me what had happened and they filled me up with 5 pints of donor blood then rushed me into surgery. Everything after that (recovery, incision, etc..) everything felt mild compared to that 4 hours of hell.",12

Kyle defended his sister from possibly a trans person who wanted to use a restroom- thats just an opinion however.

283,2021-11-20 17:58:21+00:00,"Good morning, sorry it took me so long to reply. First I'd like to say your mom's accident sounds awful and I'm truly glad she is okay. 

I get the hesitation about painkillers and possibly becoming addicted. I understand there is a huge stigma about it to. That said, she needs to accept this is as you said, a different beast. This isn't just localized sharp stabby pain. 

This is both sharp stabby pain, that's going to feel like someone took a fiery hot fireplace poker, stabbed it into her throat, and twisted it around and around for the better part of 3 to 4 months (or longer depending on how quick she recovers post treatment). 

But it's also a sort of system wide dull achey throbbing pain. A good example is how you feel with a really really bad flu but amped well past 11 and more into the 100s. It's hard to explain really because I've never felt anything else like it so it's sort of a ""you need to experience to know it"" thing, but that's the best description I can give to people. 

You're just tired, sore, basically broken. Doing anything but sleep, eat (even though you won't want to but make yourself because doctors will feeding tube your ass), sleep, sleep, sleep some more, and on really good days you might shower instead of just sponge bathe. 

It's different kind of pain that is truly impossible to describe. She's going to want relief because it's impossible to function otherwise. I was on liquid oxycotin during my radiation since I couldn't take the pills.

However if she sticks to her prescription then she might have a bit of uncomfortableness when she quits, but if she can tough that out for a few days it'll be fine. Most people don't reach the ""true addict that literally can't live without them"" stage till about a year. 

My cancer had a mutation called bRaf which made it a ***bitch*** and hyper aggressive. For a while I was getting skin grafts every 4 months or so. I ended up on painkillers for nearly 3 years thanks to that shit. Quitting was....lets say less than pleasent. 

As far as needing help, it's inevitable. If you guys can provide limited help do so on the back end. The first 2 of 3 weeks she should be mostly self sufficient. Week 3+ she's gonna need a driver. It becomes unsafe (in my opinion) because by that point she'll be in a mental fog, exhausted worse than she ever has been before, and possibly on painkillers. Really really bad combo to drive with. 

She'll also struggle to cook at that point or do much of anything. I know you said you'll be having your kid right in the middle of all of that so just be prepared you mjght need to try doubly hard to help in small ways. 

Not saying you neglect your kid or yourself but maybe if you're cooking anyway you can make a big batch of easy to eat and heat up food to give to her once your brother returns home as an example. 

Or your parnter (if they're in the picture) might be kind enough to do her grocery shopping for her when doing it for yourselves. Maybe he/she/they can just check in on your mom on the way home from work just to make sure she isn't neglecting herself. 

If your brother has only 4 weeks, he should shoot for getting there at the start of her 3rd week of treatment and leaving the first week post treatment. She'll still need help but not as badly. At that point it's more just staying home and sleeping a ton to heal up. If he can stay for 6 (3rd week of treatment till 3rd week of post treatment) that'd be way way better. 

As I've said the first two weeks of treatment really aren't that bad  It's sort of like an ever progressing stack of weight that just gets worse and worse as time goes on. It's inevitable it'll be beyond her ability to care 100% for herself by the end. 

People that I had in my radiation group that truly were 100% alone and had no family or friends or anything like that actually had the hospital set them up with something sort of like hospice, but it really wasn't hospice hospice, I wish I could remember the name of it. 

Theyd would have somebody just checking on them every day at home to make sure they were okay. Yes the patients could deny the program but I never met one who did.

So if your brother can't make it, you might want to look into something like that if you're not going to be able to help because of the baby which I totally understand. 

But this is one of those diseases where it's more like something an entire family needs to help with if it all possible. I mean unless you're wealthy and can afford private medical care teams, haha.

Anyway like I said if you have any other questions you can message me anytime and I'll try to help as much as I can. And like I said before I do genuinely and sincerely wish that your mother gets well. 

I'm not trying to be all doomsday or anything but knowing what's coming for her as I've experienced it myself she has my condolences and sympathies because it's going to suck. A lot. 

However it's not impossible to get through, it's not even the worst thing that's ever happened to me either (addiction was), so while it will suck for probably a solid 4 to 6 months I guess depending on how quickly she heals, she'll make it. 

It's not a pleasent time but the duration is short thankfully. Sort of like a really really bad fire. It burns hot as fuck but it chews through its fuel so fast it burns out quickly. It'll be brutal while it's happening (and for a bit afterwards) but it won't be life long suffering. The treatment is way way way better than the diease and something she should totally do and not give up on.

I've met people that gave up around the 3 to 5 week mark and didn't finish their treatment only to have to come back and it was ten times worse by that point because the disease and spread a lot further. Make sure she's fully committed to finishing this when she starts otherwise it's just going to do more harm than good. 

As I said I sincerely hope that she does well with her treatment, responds well, isn't too brutalized by it, and that she heals quickly afterwards. 

Also if she has any questions for me to that maybe you can't think of what she does feel free to message me those as well like I said I promise to try to be as open and honest and blunt without being all horribly negative as best I can. 

Also also I can't believe I forgot to wish you well with your pregnancy last night and I hope that it goes great for you. The timing might suck because of your mom's treatment but you seem to care greatly for her. So if you're a tenth as good of a daughter that you seem to be you're going to make a great mom. 

Good luck and I hope the pregnancy goes well! I'll be around jf you have more questions and am always willing to help.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it.

[You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

&gt; Washington— Daniella Sánchez Mercado enfrentó lo que seguramente fue uno de los más fuertes retos de su carrera en el Salón Oval de la Casa Blanca, cuando el Presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador le encargó hacer una traducción de su mensaje a Joe Biden, el cual se extendió por casi 9 minutos.                                                                                

&gt; Diversos medios de comunicación internacionales subrayaron el papel de traducción de Sánchez Mercado en la reunión bilateral de López Obrador y Biden, con la agencia española de noticias EFE calificándola como una ""heroína"" y un corresponsal de Bloomberg presente en el encuentro subrayando en Twitter su efectividad.                                                                                

&gt; De acuerdo con el propio reporte del cuerpo de reporteros de la Casa Blanca, la traducción de Sánchez Mercado fue efectiva, no sólo para resumir un mensaje del presidente mexicano -que incluyó largos pasajes históricos- sino que logró hacerlo de manera efectiva para que Biden y la prensa de EU pudieran entenderlo.                                                                                

&gt; Con más de 16 años de experiencia como interprete diplomática y de conferencias según su perfil público de la red social LinkedIn, Sánchez Mercado es egresada del Instituto Superior de Intérpretes y Traductores (ISIT) ubicado en la Ciudad de México y tiene mucha experiencia en ayudar en eventos diplomáticos.                                                                                

&gt; Competente a nivel profesional en el idioma inglés y francés, Sánchez Mercado tiene además, según fuentes consultadas por Grupo Reforma que conocen su trayectoria, la ventaja de haber crecido en un ambiente nutrido de idiomas al ser hija de dos diplomáticos de carrera mexicanos la Embajadora María Teresa Mercado Pérez y el Ministro José Sánchez Gutiérrez.

Who told you that? Some random right-wing blogger with background in medicine?

The medical examiners (who are actually qualified to answer this) claimed, ""because fentanyl typically slows down a person's breathing, the drug was not a contributing factor based on his calculations of Floyd's breathing rate based on witness video, which at the time appeared about the same as a healthy individual.  ""

If he died of overdose, his breathing rate would have been much lower, according to those with an actual background. in this field.

Dr. Daniel Isenschmid, a toxicologist at NMS Labs in Pennsylvania, presented data at trial from more than **2,300 blood samples in  fentanyl DUI cases from the last year. He showed that while the average fentanyl blood level was close to 9.6 ng/ml, a quarter of people tested had 11 ng/ml or higher.** (Important to note: Blood samples were taken from drivers who tested positive for fentanyl and were alive at the time of collection.)1/4 people with a DUI for fentanyl had a higher level of fentanyl than Floyd, and none of them died because of it. I have no idea where you got this 3x figure.

Floyd was also a fairly large individual, so you have to take that into consideration.

According to another source, ""Overdose results in respiratory depression which is reversible with naloxone. Sudden death can also occur because of cardiac arrest or severe anaphylactic reaction.  The estimated lethal dose of fentanyl in humans is 2 mg. The recommended serum concentration for analgesia is 1–2 ng/ml and for **anaesthesia it is 10–20 ng/ml**."" Meaning that Floyd was still in the range to produce a therapeutic, anesthetic effect.  Also the source claims that it would have resulted in respiratory depression, would would have noticed as decreased breathing rate.

[https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/fentanyl\_en](https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/fentanyl_en)

Though there have been **some** fatalities at ""Blood concentrations of approximately 7 ng/ml or greater have been associated with fatalities where poly-substance use was involved."" This is no where near the 3x figure you cited, and  these were special cases involving ""poly-substance use"".  **It was clear that Floyd was not one of these cases based on his breathing, according to experts who stood trial.**",8

&gt; Biden fue el primero con un discurso de 5 minutos y medio en el que repasó los lazos entre ambos países y expresó confianza en que la alianza con López Obrador demuestre que ""las democracias pueden funcionar"" ante el auge de modelos autocráticos como el chino.   

&gt; López Obrador, que mantuvo las manos entrelazadas durante buena parte del encuentro, dio las gracias a Biden por no tratar a México como ""patio trasero"".   

&gt; Además, repasó la historia compartida de las dos naciones, habló de la amistad entre Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865) y Benito Juárez (1858-1872), ""el mejor presidente de México"", y dijo que su país quiere que avance en el Congreso la propuesta de reforma migratoria de Biden, que beneficiaría a muchos mexicanos que viven de manera irregular en Estados Unidos.

I was crushed when his character got addicted. And to be completely honest I've never really had much sympathy for Dr's since mine gave me so much I got addicted.. but after seeing his character it really opened my eyes to seeing just how much Dr's were a victim too and truly most wanted to help. I've seen a lot of documentaries where it's shows Dr's running pill mills and only in it for the money. 

But that truly was only so many of them compared to the bigger picture. Now I have a new outlook on how my Dr most likely got played. And he didn't do anything illegal and he stopped when things started coming out about it... I went on methadone and honestly it probably saved my life. I never got to the point of herion thank God. If I didn't have access to treatment I absolutely would of went that way and probably overdose. This was such an amazing show. I'm trying to get my 18yr old son to watch it. 

He knows about me and kind of what happened to ppl like me and how I got addicted. But I feel like this show really shows all perspectives and if I can walk away with learning even more then I knew before, I think it's important for family and friends of addicts to see this that truly have no idea what its really like.

349,2021-11-18 16:32:29+00:00,"It is interesting that if there is actual scientific evidence to support herbalism and yoga then they will use it, but will ignore so much other scientific evidence. On that note, there are sometimes good reason to see scientific research as invalid because of implicit biases. A lot of times medical research is done with a goal to get a certain result- a quote I recently heard when asked why research was never published “the results were just so disappointing” (sorry I don’t recall what the research was on, but can find it again if anyone wants to know.)
In addition, natural existing plants cannot be copyrighted and therefore there is no financial incentive to research the efficacy and safety of some herbal medicine. However, if a plant shows promise for treating many people (take sweet Annie for malaria) then research is done and often the active compound is extracted to use in a pill form. 
So I see why there is distrust, especially when looking at addictive pharmaceuticals like OxyCotin. Unfortunately, if our systems weren’t so corrupt, we’d likely never be dealing with this level of government distrust at all, so no matter which side you’re on, I feel like we can all blame the government. Of course, at least one person will disagree and that’s cool.",1

The FDA did not approve the transdermal patch because of the widespread opiate abuse and political pressure to scale back on new opiates.)

Also, this is totally Brando's story and I'm not saying any of it is WRONG, it just doesn't agree with me. Regardless, to answer your questions:  
  
Characters: Characters are imo awful by ""cosmere standards"". Each character gets one trait, then maybe a scene or two showing something else: Sarene is smart politics girl with one scene about being forever alone; the king is big dummy dick with one scene where he's a cultist serial killer; Gallodan is a snarky pessimistic sidekick; Kaian (cook?) is a funny warmhearted cliche; etc.. Hrathen is the exception - he's an incredible character, even with the IMO silly and unnecessary declaration of love at the end of the book. Compare these characters with Stormlight characters - they're incredibly nuanced, complete with personality contradictions, hopes, flaws, boons, etc.; obviously they have the benefit of more pages allowing better development, but I'd argue they were vastly superior at the end of TWOK than any character in Elantris minus Hrathen.  
  
As far as Raoden - I'm frankly surprised that needs explaining. He's completely faultless. He turns a mass murderer crime lord into a gentle devoted muffin that makes toys for children with just, like, 3 lines of dialogue. Not even Naruto could do that. He is a perfect leader, a perfect friend, a consummate scholar (seen in his relentless and unbelievably effective research); he's selfless, brave, intelligent, emotionally mature, convincing, strong-willed, a great actor, etc. etc. etc. you can honestly go on and on. I found him incredibly boring and had trouble staying tuned during his chapters.

\- **Diuna** \- w sumie ciekawie - byłem z 2 znajomymi. Ja przeczytałem wszystkie Diuny w tym roku, znajomy 1 kiedyś tam czytał wszystkie, znajomy 2 nigdy nie czytał. I nasze oceny po seansie Ja: 6.5/10, znajomy 1: 7,5-8/10, znajomy 2 8.5-9/10. Ogólnie część rozwiązań filmowych rozumiem, część nie do końca. Jak dla mnie np. cały Kalladan mógłby być tylko wspomnieniem bohatera a zamiast tego mogliby bardziej pokazać Arrakis. Albo w ogóle pokazać miasto. Nie do końca zgadzam się z tym co reżyser wybrał aby wyeksponować a co mocno skrócił albo w ogóle usunął. Zabrakło mi też mocno &gt;!jakiegoś fajnego CGI na potrzeby spojrzenia w przyszłość podczas sceny w namiocie. Zamiast tego ujrzeliśmy gadającego od rzeczy nastolatka który nakrzyczał nieładnie na mamusie.!&lt; Do tego ledwo co się akcja zaczęła rozkręcać to End Part I. Ale znowu, nie jestem reżyserem, moja wersja może byłaby kompletną klapą, kto wie.   
Ogólnie zgaduję że za jakiś czas wyjdzie wersja reżyserska, która będzie &gt;3h i wtedy może podbiję swoją ocenę, na razie - meh, ale pewnie pójdę na następne. 

\- **Food Wars**  \- jeśli ktoś ma gamepassa to jest dostęp do 75dni premium crunchyroll-a jako perk. Jako, że dawno chińskich bajek nie oglądałem to ruszyłem Food Wars którego daawno temu oglądałem 1 sezon. Jest podobnie jak 1, naśmiewa się z różnych amerykańskich talent show, szczególnie reakcji sędziów, mnie mocno bawi. Co ciekawe niektóre jedzenia mam ochotę sam zrobić w domu, ciekawe co z tego wyjdzie. Ogólnie polecam, szczególnie w jedynej słusznej cenie.  


Jeśli chodzi o książki:

\- **Bobiversum**, a dokładniej 4 książki (**Naszę imie Legion, naszę imie Bob**; **Gdyż jest nas wielu**; **Wszystkie te światy**; **Niebiańska rzeka**) - no wychodzi że jestem fanem. Słucham w wersji audioteki, baardzo przyjemna lekka scifi z różnymi fajnymi pomysłami. Zaczyna się od tego, że główny bohater (nie zgadniecie - Bob) po śmierci staje się sondą von Neumanna. Mam podobne odczucia jak przy czytaniu Marsjanina Anry Weira - to nie żadne wysokie sci fi, nie odkrywa ameryki ale czyta się szalenie przyjemnie i jest dużo nerdowania. Takie troche harlekiny scifi ;) Polecam wszystkim pomiędzy cięższymi pozycjami.  
Filmy na podstawie tej serii będą ciekawe - bo tam Boby rozmawiają pomiędzy sobą w VR, gdzie każdy (na początku) wygląda tak samo, a różni się metadanymi.  


\- **Sunreach** \+ **ReDawn** Sandersona + Janci Petterson - Sanderson jeśli ktoś nie wie, w pewnym momencie napisał swoje sci fi, wyszły na razie dwie książki - Skyward i Starsight. Na dniach ma wyjść kolejna część Cytonic, więc co robi terminator Sanderson? W międzyczasie (co prawda z pomocą Janci Petterson) napisał 3 nowele, dwie które dzieją się pomiędzy Starsight a cytonic a jedna która będzie dziać się po Cytonic. Wydaje ją jako serial więc można by powiedzieć, że skok na kase, gdyby nie to, że każda to \~300stron więc u innych autorów ze spokojem mogła by być pełnoprawną książką. Co odróżnia te nowele od głównej serii to inni bohaterowie główni. Ogólnie bardzo fajny dodatek, też szybko się czytało, ale Sanderson dla mnie to taka troche heroina więc mogę nie być obiektywny.

Ogólnie cała seria Skyward jest dosyć ciekawa - ludzkość kiedyś była OP i walczyła ze wszystkimi ale w końcu przegrała. Jeden z ostatnich statków ludzkości spadł na obcą planetę, a obcy urządzili sobie z tego skansen ludzkości - nie wybili ich do końca, ale co chwilą robią naloty co by ludzie się nie nudzili i nie odbudowali cywilizacji. Seria z perspektywy nastolatki która okazuje się super pilotem myśliwca - takie trochę połączenie Harry Potter + Starwarsy. Ogólnie strzelam że kiedyś to muszą sfilmować, i o ile za ekranizacje nie będzie odpowiedzialny ten od ekranizacji Mrocznej Wieży to będzie hit.",1

415,2021-11-15 18:02:03+00:00,"At least where I’m from, I know that there have been reports of fentanyl being mixed in with meth, coke, and pressed pills. People cut stuff with fent because it has such physically addictive properties. He genuinely may not have known he was taking it. It really does depend where his drugs were sourced from. Perhaps look into if there were other fentanyl related OD’s in that area around the same time. That could be an indicator.

Taking too much amphetamine can be very unpleasant. He just as well could have wanted to take a downer to counteract in the event he was having a bad trip while high. 

Downers impair and suppress respiration and uppers increase respiratory workload causing fatigue. Overworking any system has a chance of causing it to fail. Additionally, when you’re high on counteractive substances, it’s easy to think you’re more in control than you are because it cancels out some of the high on both ends. Even though you don’t feel it, your body is still suffering the wear and tear.

Another way to potentially speak for why he has the array of drugs in his system, he could have taken meth and then fantanyl, realized he wasn’t as “up” as he wanted to be, took amphetamine, and then realized he overcorrected too much there as well and took another synthetic opiate (Tramadol).

More often than not, people who overdose do so accidentally. Of course nobody can tell for sure, but if I had to guess he probably didn’t mean to.

Just. Nagu teedemaks. Kui sõidad, siis kulutad ja vastavalt parameetritele (nt kaal jne) võiksid olla ka maksud. Kui mina näiteks liigun jalgsi, siis ma ei taha, et ma peaksin autoteede eest maksma.

Jah, sul on ilmselt õigus, et heroiin on kangem kraam, aga selle surmavus on ka seotud sellega, et see ei ole puhas (segatud fentanüüli või muude sünteetiliste opioididega) või kasutatakse alkoholi taustal või ühes rahustitega. Sõltuvuse tekkimises mängib kindlasti rolli doos ja kui kiiresti see vereringesse satub.

There was nothing snobbish whatsoever about my post,  you obviously have a bit of a complex when it comes to your own use of narcotic pain management.  

My post only offends you because you're obviously one of those people who think everyone on the planet is against your method of chronic pain control.   I used to feel the same way, tired of the stigma imposed because a huge percentage of the population abuses them. And those who don't,  are always branded as seekers regardless of the root cause, although imm ot even sure that's the issue with you. 

I'd say a lifetime basically (since the age of 17) gives me some insight into the world of narcotic pain management.   I've had much stronger meds 

First of all, I'm well aware of the difference between opiates and opioids.   And if you'd done any research whatsoever on the topic,  there's a difference in the way they work with your receptors on a molecular level.  I've studied multiple types of narcotic pain medications down to the molecular level,  so yeah, inhave some knowledge.  

Get over yourself, your an angry person who is either ashamed of the meds you take or just angrily projecting because you hate the world you exist within. 

I've reiterated with you that I'm under medical supervision. And anyone considering this should be under medical supervision...I messed up trying to do this on my own. And I've reiterated that this isn't for everyone, a few times!  

I was offered stronger meds, I DIDN'T WANT THEM...WHY WOULD I AGREE TO AN EVEN MORE PHYSICALLY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE IF I FEEL I CAN MANAGE WITHOUT. I choose to feel a bit of pain so I don't have to do a 30 day detox program when another drug is found and I can use that instead?   If you could choose not to be on your narcs  and still feel OK,  would you? Sorry I'm not as hard as you with your fentenyl patch or oxy or whatever. 

You sound to me like one of those ""I hurt my knee six years ago and still need oxy to function"" types,  not someone with an actual long term disease who struggles with the choice to take narcotic pain meds...sounds to me like your get defensive because maybe you have a physical dependency as well as an emotional one.  

Anyone who has studied this, has come to the conclusion that long term use is not ideal, tolerance is an issue as are many other things. It is only advisable under some pretty extreme circumstances.   

Listen,  fentenyl Franny; you're all over the place. First I'm not hard-core enough to be a ""real person"" with chronic pain, then I'm a Healthcare professional of some kind who hates narcotic pain meds...yet I ""don't know a ton about pain medication""  which the fuck is it?  

You have a problem with anyone saying anything other than agreeing with your stance that these meds are fine and necessary.   They are for some, but for others; they aren't,  and cause more issues than they actually solve.  

I'm not trying to tell anyone to do a fucking thing, I'm trying to put it out there that maybe...JUST MAYBE for someone who doesn't want to take this stuff anymore; there might be another answer.  

I chose codiene because of the fact that its not a hard core drug, most people don't want hard core drugs...many do,  and that's up to them.   Every doctor and specialist I saw offerrd something stronger,  trust me.  And refusing the strong stuff is hard when you're in pain, but i was holding out hope that there would be another solution.  Sorry it works and I shared it to potentially help others.

I remember saying what hospital is he in I’m on my way and my friends like bro you don’t understand he’s already dead and I’m like no he’s not he just needs to be revived I’m on my way. My friend had to say it to me like five times before it finally clicked in my head. I started crying uncontrollably in the middle of the campus, I had to call someone to come pick me up because I couldn’t even drive my car. I decided to get sober after that.

Another close friend lost is fiancé to a fetanyl overdose, and only a few months later he died of the same thing.

A girl I was somewhat friends with died of overdose shortly after having her son. Luckily, the guy who she was with was smart enough to get sober afterwards and he seems to be doing the best he can for his kid as a single dad.

It’s really crushing too, most of us start using drugs because of traumas from our childhood that we don’t even realize effects our behaviors. I didn’t realize until my therapist pointed out to me how many things I do are because I was abused heavily as a child. 

Also, my therapist told me that it’s almost impossible to beat an addictive personality, so it’s good to find healthy outlets to be “addicted” to. I told her I always liked the gym but I never took it serious. 5 years later here I am sober and bigger than I ever thought I could be",26

I disliked being drowsy all the time, and now I dislike being an “addict” to a drug I'm legally prescribed. How much of the pain is all in my head? Do I *need* to take the dosage that I do? I've actually cut back by 20mg a day, and started cutting pills in half to take less when it may not be necessary. But, I *do* have a physical wound I can point at and say, “*Yes*, that hurts.” And, I'm frustrated that alternatives like cannabis — I'm drug screened each month and don't reside in a legal state — are off-limits.",125

446,2021-11-14 07:02:10+00:00,"&gt;Because you have kidneys and a liver

Those of mine are probably dying off by now.. got addicted to Tramadol/Paracetamol 5 years ago due to decreasing/worsening vision (which is consistent in its continual degradation, leading to an extremely low level of mental health). Each time I would get off it my vision would worsen again... leading to me getting back on it (as antidepressants never worked for me, and only made me feel EVEN worse &amp; cause seizures/fainting).  


Now that the results have shown that my liver and kidneys are in bad health, I want to get off it since it is no longer a matter of choice but an absolute must.. but now I also have an extremely painful spine hernia (nerve pain medications I cannot use as it can, very likely, make the vision even worse which is the last thing I want). Hydro/Oxycodon has been tried but also lacks potency without the Paracetamol (which is the main toxic thing).  


The MRI has been taken some time ago (and the appointment for surgery will be made the beginning of next month) but due to the utterly INSANE waiting times in our country which has been aggravated by Covid, it seems likely I will be waiting at least a couple of months, which is bad news considering the nausea and extreme fatigue/pain. I had requested an urgent treatment but it is simply impossible thanks to Covid.  


Now, I would get off it right now but the pain would then be way too much to bear, leading to even worse mental health and (very) bad sleep - which can ALSO influence the vision getting worse. Right now I am just stuck in a really, really shitty situation and I've no idea what to do..   


Do you have any ideas perhaps? T'would be GREATLY appreciated, as you seem knowledgeable, feel free to contact me with messaging or whichever you prefer if you have any advice or any of the like and feel like a good Samaritan today, heh.",1

In 2015 I got a lot of pressed blue 30s on Silk Road (with BTC I fucking WISH I still had... fuck I'd be so rich) and then I went to detox after a few months. There was no oxy nor morphine in my blood, only fentanyl and dilaudid somehow. And that was exactly 6 years ago. All the friends I had met in the recovery world from 2012-2016 are dead as of 2019, pretty much every single one within their first week, if not first day, of relapsing. Several after a few years. The knowledge that there's likely only fentanyl out there is probably 90% of what keeps me clean, if I could get consistent, verifiable oxy or hydrocodone or codeine or morphine, honest to God I couldn't tell you if 6 years as an adult after getting clean at 21 would mean fucking shit to me. But I know it's all just fentany, and I'm petrified of death,  especially with how many of my friends, roommates even I have found dead or spoken to in the evening to find a sad Facebook post about them in the morning.

The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues.

It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/).

Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

 I know Canada has a huge Dilaudid problem cause it's scripted there in ER formula at high doses but in the US it isn't often used for pain management as much as oxy(codone or morphone).

Das dies so ist, kann man an Beispielen wie des Entstehens von schmerz-therapeutischen Zentren, wo junge Menschen mit Oxycodon vollgestopft werden oder das massenweise Verabreichen von Adderall an Kindern ( add steht für adhs in Englisch, das all am Ende ist ein Wortspiel für ""alle"" ), nur weil es etwas lebendiger ist und einige Ärzte fungieren dabei mehr als Apotheker als Ärzte. Mich nervt auch unwissenschaftlicher Quatsch, besonders wenn man mit Globulis versucht eine Angina zu verarzten oder wenn man denkt, weil Natur, dsw. ungefährlich. Aber man muss sich damit auseinander setzen was mRNA, was Vektorimpfstoffe und was Totimpfstoffe sind. Warum lässt die EU keine chinesischen Totimpfstoffe zu ( Sinovac ), sondern zwingt die Menschen eine ganz neue, ungetestete Art von Impfungen ( mRNA ) zu konsumieren. Der Punkt ist, das wir als Experiment-Vieh verwendet wurden und keiner Rafft das von den geimpften. Und noch was zur Info: mRNA-Impfungen müssen immer aufgefrischt werden, auch wenn das Virus nicht mutiert.",1

The whole conversation over Floyd would have been really easy and extremely agreeable if some people hadn't latched onto his criminal record as some kind of argument that negligent (at minimum) homicide committed by a police officer is somehow excusable.

The only legitimate thing to consider there in my opinion was how much the drugs may have contributed to Floyd dying. It does seem to me like as small as Chauvin was compared to Floyd, pinning him like that probably wouldn't have killed him if he wasn't OD'ing on meth and fentenyl at the time.

But even then, that's just a conversation about whether Chauvin killed Floyd intentionally or by accident. To argue that having a drug problem means he somehow deserved it, or that Chauvin shouldn't have been more responsible knowing full well that the guy was bugging out and having serious problems, just completely misses the point from a morality standpoint.

That's a good comparison, internet stranger.",10

Ive personally never tried kratom but if your using that to get high or sustain a addiction to it I personally would Say you swap a habit for another habit. I've never tried kratom and I have no idea how addictive it is ( I think it's illegal In Australia) but I'm interested that you use a different drug what was the reason? Is it to change from opioids of thats the ecase man that's awesome and definitely be proud.of.it and definitely if your.taking fentany and other opioids that's a huge accomplishment.so Kratom is a plant? I assume it is. Whats the high like? I've heard it produces a opioid effect. Personally I think if you were serious about being clean go on Suboxone or methadone.thes meds are ideal for users of opioids if I was.you I would give these meds are.go.ive been on suboxone and it helped me in recovery. Idk much about kartom and it's legal status but that's  massive change you did and its up to you like it's been a long time since you used and that's a massive postive. Also it's important to go to meetings you dont have to your choice  :)  man that's a massive change like Ik you swap but If it works that's awesome do you like weed? That's another one you can use.

Im not encourageing drug use but If it works and stops someone using fent ( a drug thats stronger than Herion and definitely a heavy drug) I need to do more research on kratom and maybe use it for myself. Anyways man congrats on the 78 days. I really encourage methadone or Suboxone these meds aessential.for.recovery. also doing meetings and smart recovery.gets you engaged.with other users it helps alot and you dont have to talk but if you listen you get tips on what they do a and what works. 

W got to do research on the kratom dose it produces effects like opiods it might not be True this is the first time I've actually.heard.of it but man that's a massive accomplishments
And 78.days clean man Your beating a opioid.addiction.

Last thing I really encourage.you to.try a clean.phase no kartom.nothing and see how you go you don't have to do it iyour not ready I just.encourge you to.see.if. you can go clean
I did.and I lasted.11.days I went back.to.drinking.and popping pills but I kept.trying and the.days got longer it's important and. really encourage.you to give it a go also those meds.help.a.alot and If.i was you i would push for suboxone so theres like a.safety.net Incase you do go.back to.opiods.and man if.kratom worked.for you keep.doing.it but if I was.you I would.slowly engage with meetings and Ik I'm pushing it but it helped.me.tk.learn other peoples.stories.and what they do to.not  use and man I'm really happy that you did 78.days clean I relapse.and.had.a bender alcohol Gabapentin meth herion and it was.i.had.5 point of.it and so.yeah Im.defentily.did.a.bad move. OkSo.dont do what i.did.and man keep moving In a positive path and Ive said.it.heaps I would try a clean period and.see.how.you do also talk to the dr that works.at the chemist.i.would.go.suboxone see.how.that works you.also.have methadone.

Anyways man stay positive and Im super proud that you did 78.days clean man like good work bro I'm going to give it a.try and see how I go.

Pharmaceutical companies over the last 20+ years had been pushing doctors to prescribe opioid medications like Vicoden and Ocycontin and many people then became addicted. Some moved on to harder drugs like heroin. This is not the only reason for the large homeless population but it’s one of the causes. “Addict behavior” can be similar to a zombie mindlessly searching for brains. They’ll do anything to get drugs even lie cheat and steal from family members.

Claro! O nome me deixava confuso mesmo rs

Eu percebi que já cruzei com a página desse Paul no wikipedia, e me interessei justamente por ser um sujeito da área da computação, tem muita falação sobre computação e organização econômica hoje em dia, ainda estou para avaliar isso daí. O partido da grã-bretanha foi a origem do termo tankie, então daí você já tira...

'Traição' é um termo típico da política dos grandes lideres. Sei não sobre esse negócio do trotsky, não só considero essa tese do 'estado operário degenerado' como ambiguo e justamente por isso inefetivo, como acho que o histórico desse sujeito tá além de qualquer mea culpa!

Eu gosto de 'ortodoxia' e 'heterodoxia' na medida que exigem uma reflexão sobre como devemos nos relacionar com as teorias e orientações, e como devemos pensar a coerência interna das correntes e campos. Claro que são termos abusados no uso, mas na própria economia existe uma discussão sobre o que seria constitutivamente heterodoxia, ao invés de ficarmos usando só como uma categoria circunstâncial em que qualquer heterodoxia poderia assumir a ortodoxia, sendo só um movimento de ascensão. Longe disso, me interesso pelo que seria uma heterodoxia por natureza, sem cair claro em pluralismos indiscriminados, como dizem... 

Porque penso que o anarquismo e o socialismo libertário, para já abordar seu último ponto, é uma heterodoxia em seu sentido mais próprio, e que isso é bastante determinante para como a gente pensa essas correntes. Pq, novamento, como você bem disse, o primeiro movimento de todo mundo, eu inclusive, é tentar compreender o anarquismo e o socialismo libertário como se fosse 'formalmente compatível' com o marxismo, que é de certa forma um paradigma de teoria e ideologia e da interação entre ambas (apesar de que internamente tudo é bem mais controverso...), por isso, como dizem uns historiadores, na historiografia marxista ortodoxa que trata da Associação Internacional dos Trabalhadores, Marx é um das únicas personalidades que saltam da massa de pessoas que compõe o 'fundo' da organização, e a única outra personalidade é Bakunin, mas esse na forma do anticristo e do anti-heroi, que foi necessário destruir, pelo menos é assim que é frequentemente recontada a história. E daí que minha provocação é sempre fizer que o socialismo libertário em geral não pode ser compreendido por esses modelos, é justamente porque não existe um Marx, ou seja, porque não existe uma autoridade teórica em torno da qual se organiza todo o campo, que o socialismo libertário *deve* ser uma heterodoxia, porque sua dinâmica de manter a coerência deve encontrar outros principios organizativos bastante diferentes, e complicado de entender imediatamente, eu pelo menos não tenho uma grande teória sobre isso.

Por isso o Marx dos libertários é o próprio Marx, só que dessa vez tornado um humano finito como todos nós, que deve ser compreendido como *um* em uma tradição coletiva do socialismo. 

Isso é só uma divagação que gosto de fazer. Eu não sei dizer se tem alguém que eu gosto MUITO, porque é tanta gente kkkk Malatesta e Bakunin foram militantes excepcionais, é eu aprendo bastante lendo e admiro bastante aqueles que buscam recuperar ambos, mas cotidianamente eu acompanho bastante uma galera autonomista-anarquista (que vive entre ambos), que sempre tem umas sacadas geniais sobre o desenvolvimento das lutas. O sindicalismo revolucionário é bastante complexo, porque é justamente uma orientação política sobre construir organizações sociais animada pelas lutas do cotidiano proletário, *dentro da qual* uma consciência classista e revolucionária possa se desenvolver. Tem seu antecedente na AIT né, e posição da ala federalista da AIT, que bakunin fazia parte e é figura relevante, é muito importante nessa história. Mas o sindicalismo revolucionário vai ser propriamente elaborado pela formação da CGT, e para isso são importantes figuras como fernand pelloutier. Mas minhas parada nem é tanto ler fixamente essa galera, mas ir acompanhando os desdobramentos da luta combativa e autônoma aqui e no mundo, o sindicalismo rev. tem se rearticulado pesadamente com a nova Confederação Internacional do Trabalho.

Mas economicamente eu me interesso esse cruzamento entre 'marxistas' libertários, radicais sociais da economia ecológica e as críticas sociais do anarquismo. Mas não tenho nada muito claro sobre isso ainda não.",1

By day 3 and especially 4, I dramatically improved and drinking became fairly normal. It was at this point I realized I could and was going to get through it. I wasn't in much pain and didn't use the prescribed oxycotin as I didn't need it. I was also worried about it making me constipated. 

Tomorrow is my month anniversary and I'm starting to incorporate solid foods again. Got through all the diets after worrying about them immensely and I'm down 31lbs sitting at 281lbs. My HW was 342 and my SW was 313.

I didn't have many health issues related to my obesity, but I'd still do it again in a heartbeat. It's so motivating to see your clothes not fit anymore or to be able to sit in a chair at a sporting event comfortably.

&gt;""isteria femeilor"" era o boala psihiatrica

Asa e, o rusine pentru umanitate, am avut niste perioade in care am fost niste imbecili, perioada in care drogurile precum cocaina, heroina, morfina si amfetamina erau abuzate (se crede ca de fapt ele au provocat razboaiele mondiale), perioada fiind destul de aproape de perioada in care drogurile se puteau cumpara de oricine. Am facut niste greseli considerabile in istorie.

&gt;Si perioada adolescentei predispune la depresie (pubertatea e enumerata la factori de risc pt depresie in tratate), deci adolescenta e o boala psihica, dupa logica ta, nu?

Ai pus bine intrebarea

&gt;De asemenea, depresia e cea cu rata mare de suicid, **iar cei cu gender dysphoria** (*vezi ca body dysphoria e altceva*) **sunt predispusi la ea**.

Greseala mea. Intrebarea mea este de ce ei sunt predispusi, chiar si dupa tratament. Pentru ca nu se simt acceptati de societate? Nu era asta oare problema de la bun inceput? Prin asa ceva cred ca am trecut destui, mai ales in adolescenta dar nu mi-am inradacinat vina pe sex.

Ca sa intelegi de ce sustin ca gender dysmorphia face parte dintr-o boala mentala, pe langa statisticile de depresie care sa zicem ca sunt discutabile, iti recomand specialul lui Dave Chapelle: the closer, in special secventa in care vorbeste de Daphne Dorman (tine minte, comunitatea trans e foarte mica comparativ cu altele)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLK16VFEMaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLK16VFEMaM)

O sa intelegi fragilitatea starilor mentale la care ei sunt vulnerabili. Da poate au fost niste cazuri fericite. Asta inseamna ca schimbarea de sex e solutia? Statistic vorbind, nu.

Heroin addicts have used *everything* to shoot up with before

&gt;Are there research opioids that permanently bind to your brains receptors and “nuke” them so that they are damaged and can’t activate with very bad withdrawals? Oxymorphazone or something.

First up, [Lens Eye.](https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/lens_eye#1) A story about Tojiko turning invisible. Fun story and gets a bit somber at the end.

Next, [Hungry Wolf.](https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/hungry_wolf#1) Seemingly a nice story about Kagerou and Wakasagihime. But what's the reason for her hunger?

Then there's [The Two of Them Mid-Winter.](https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/the_two_of_them_mid_winter#1) A funny little short story revolving Byakuren and Miko talking about Winter and clothing.

Now, there's [Midnight in the Kaian Passageway.](https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/midnight_in_the_kaian_passageway) Sagume goes to meet Doremy and they explore some dreams together.

[Present From Hell](https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/present_from_hell#1) is another funny story about the Hell Trio going to Reimu's shrine in the middle of Winter and engaging in classic tomfoolery.

For your serious somber story needs, [Moriya-Sama](https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/moriya_sama#1) has got your back. A story of a woman is going around the village, and things are seemingly disappearing and being forgotten. What could it be?

Finally, we have [Desire to Feed Yoshika-Chan.](https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/desire_to_feed_yoshika_chan#1) Miko has to feed Yoshika while Seiga is away, and the gang engage in fun light-hearted discussion. But what's that Miko hears in Yoshika's heart?

556,2021-11-10 07:46:50+00:00,"No you literally just want to use your opiate to essentially ward off precipitated withdrawals. 

So technically your microdosing yourself getting mild precipitated withdrawals, “curing” the precipitated withdrawals (or PWDS) and then rinse and repeat. I would probably say it’s smart to write down every dose of sub you take and weigh (if you have a scale) your fetty/dope to keep track of when you take your sub and how much traditional opiate your taking. I say this especially because you do want to start lowering(even though not completely necessary) your dose of opiate (h/fet) once you reach like the halfway mark or day 8/9. You’ll probably want to lower it aswell because at this point it’s not really doing much in terms of getting you high so you’ll just end up wasting money, time , and energy doing your DOC. 

I will say I’m on day 5 of a slightly modified very slow Bernese method, I took .5 mg in the morning 8 am and 1 mg of sub 8pm and already I am not feeling really any precipitated withdrawals, meaning I probably already have a decent enough dose of bupe built up in my brain to almost completely block the opiate therefore when I take more suboxone/bupe , there is no traditional opiate to replace in my brains neurotransmitter synapse , which is essentially what causes precipitated withdrawals. That along with the fact that I barely BARELY even feel a shot of street tar leads me to believe this Bernese method of microdosing titrating your dose of bupe up while using your DOC is a god send when it comes to suboxone induction. Especially the probably soon to be outdated method (due to fetanyl tainting most if not all of the street heroin) inducing aka waiting as long as you possibly can , get into moderate acute withdrawals and then dosing your suboxone which puts you at risk to deal with precipitated withdrawals and the ptsd that is associated with PWDS. Let me know if you have any questions or want a link to the schedule I used !",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

          2.   Norfentanyl 5.6 ng/mL

Notice that according to the CDC a lethal dose of fentenyl can be 11ng/ml and the fact that he had 5.6 ng/ml of norfentanyl means he was extremely high and already metabolizing fentanyl in his system. Along with the other drugs…

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/pdfs/mm6604a4.pdf

568,2021-11-09 19:53:05+00:00,"So once diagnosed with CP I started with paracetamol (Tylenol). What made a big difference with me was Amitriptiline, a drug used for nerve pain. I initially was on lowest dose of 10mg but this year I had to upgrade to 50mg as I had a horrible couple of months in the Summer where my pain increased. At the moment the combination of paracetamol and amitriptiline works well enough for me, as long as I’m super careful with my diet (and stress).

I had tried some opioids when I was in flares. Initially tramadol, but I didn’t see much progress with this. Then in the Summer when I felt awful they gave me oxycodon 5mg, which helped me on those awful pain nights to sleep. But I didn’t take much. Personally I don’t want to have too many opioids. I don’t like the feeling of being on them, but of course I realize I might have to some day.

I am attending a pain clinic and the doctor there is good. They were going to give me a splachnic nerve block but as I was doing better recently we both agreed not to. But I would try this in future if I declined.

In terms of alternative treatment, I do acupuncture fairly regularly. I think this helps, mainly mentally I’d say. I used to meditate every day but have dropped that past weeks, which I want to change. The webinar from Mission Cure also emphasized the benefits of meditation. I think it helps is to stay grounded as chronic pain is heavy. Ultimately diet is biggest impact on my pain.",1
569,2021-11-09 19:48:45+00:00,"The studies I have personally seen all have it as being a minimum of 200 mg roughly and up to 600mg in cycles for extreme examples(patients coming off oxycotin I think the drug was in question). This makes the cost pretty prohibitive if you buy one of these often mentioned companies unless you are semi-decent at online sleuthing and can find the bulk deals from th le farmers/wholesalers themselves. 

It can interact with medications much like Grapefruit does though if alot is taken in an isolate form, so watch it and do your research on that.

As far as a topical, it works real nice.

---------|----------|----------|
Anyone die around you directly related to “business”?|Pretty much everyone. Either dead, in prison or addicted to drugs.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjxvc9m/)
Unfortunately I got into international trafficking when I was like 20. It's very hard to cope with how many lives I helped ruin even this many years later.|I try not to think about it. I was desensitized for a long time. Nothing I can do to change the past. It hurts to think about that.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjxvz49/)
What did you think of Breaking Bad?|Accurate. Many high level drug dealers I've met were very professional businessmen. They don't do drugs. They are very disciplined and friendly. Don't cross them.  The only thing I don't like is when they're meeting in the desert. We all know to hide in plain sight|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjxw5az/)
How much money did u net. How did you hide it.|Ehh.. hard to say profit wise. My money was always somebody else's or invested in some type of product and all over the place. I was also an addict and unable to stop. Always had lots and lots of money, but could never ever keep it. That's the game. You get exploited while exploiting people. Not fun.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjxx0qd/)
Did you ever use reddit for illegal activities?|Nope. This was before the internet got big. We never spoke of activities via text or on the phone. That would've been stupid.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjxx3sb/)
How many overdoses do you think you contributed to?|Probably a few. Herion was taboo and I would never sell cocaine or meth. I was more into the festival scene. This was also before fetanyl showed up in every drug known to man. It was a different game than it is now.  We sold pot, LSD, ketamine, shrooms, and MDMA in bulk to street dealers. I'm sure somewhere down the line someone got too messed up from something I sold.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjxvcea/)
Which illegal substance was most profitable?|LSD|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjxvs2d/)
Have you needed to stick it up your bum?|Hah! Nope lmao. I've heard many stories, though😅🤣|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjy0at5/)
Did you have notable competitors in the drug market? If so were they ever a threat to your wellbeing?|Nope. I was able to supply everyone and their competitors. We had no problems with anybody, we really just managed the logistical aspects of moving things around and getting them from one place to another and conflating the price.  The only threat to my wellbeing was when I beat a guy up for ripping me off. He was in a gang and that was a bad idea. Spent the better part of a year looking over my shoulder.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjy3gri/)
Have you transitioned from that trade to a “normal” career and life, and if so please describe it?|Yep. Took years and years of fighting addiction and re learning how to be a human being.  I've worked as a Sous Chef and a chef.  I love kitchens, easy jobs to get and lots of fun, but I want to do something more meaningful.  Participate in N/A and A/A, still smoking weed but looking to move on and be sober so I can help people and show them recovery is possible|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjy4z51/)
Not here to ask a question, just to say that I’m happy for you. Go you for getting out.|Thank you! Almost didn't make it. Not sure how or why I'm here but I want people to know  1. It's a dangerous, ugly business based on the exploitation of people  2. Nobody gets to keep their money, ever. Eventually you will be sucked dry or caught and robbed by the police. (Or you will die. Ive lost 8 friends in total to this lifestyle, 20 if you count those incarcerated)  3. It's possible to recover from this lifestyle.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjy5kw6/)
Any close calls during trafficking?|Ironically, no. Every close call was when I was just trying to have a good time myself and was unprepared.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjxymla/)
Have you ever had a gay experience?|Plenty of guys have tried to persuade me, but no 🤣|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq56sg/i_distributed_and_trafficked_illegal_drugs_for_10/hjy9hqr/)

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

615,2021-11-08 01:00:57+00:00,"""Roofies"" aka rohypnol is just a benzodiazapine, the effects of which differ wildly from the reported facts of the security guard. The story ONLY works with an opioid overdose.

- The guard was revived with Narcan/naloxone, which works on opioid receptors and only opioid receptors. It works by blocking those receptors so the receptor can't be ""filled"" with the opioid you use (heroin, morohine, fent, etc). Benzodiazapines act on GABA receptors. Since the guard was allegedy revived using Narcan, the only possible explaination is that he was administered an opioid.
- Benzodiazapine overdoses on their own generally don't kill you. What kills people is taking benzos in combination with other sedative drugs, most commonly alcohol. Benzodiazapines and fentanyl is a particularly lethal combination--but it usually doesn't respond well to Narcan. People who take that combination generally need multiple doses of Narcan and it's a really horrible situation to manage that can end with either brain damage due to hypoxia or death. That doesn't really track with the story that the guard took one dose of Narcan.",0

So the only pharmacological difference is the 25% left handed amphetamine in adderall.

Mirror images of molecules can have extremely different properties. Take DXM (cough syrup, dextro-methorphan), it's over the counter cough meds. But the left handed form, levo-methorphan, is a prodrug to levallorphan, a painkiller more potent than morphone.

685,2021-11-05 17:42:30+00:00,"I think this was put pretty well. Like I said it's been a couple weeks and I'm still kind of processing that it happened at all. However I'm reaching a point be it age, exhaustion, or lost hope, where frankly I just don't give it the time of day anymore. I also disagree that to correct this line of though people need to be met with outrightly 'challenging' them. I've been the black sheep in my family as far as politics is concerned for as long as I can remember (sad that a vaccine is a political view now). I've learned in endless debates with both my family, and those with similar views, that outright challenging them almost never works and only solidifies their views more. It seems as though they are so certain they are correct in their beliefs that it matters very little what confrontation says as they just chalk it up to ""I'm right, they're wrong."" I've also been guilty of the same thing at least a couple of times in my life. 

Furthermore, people gathering with like minded people is not something new, we all gravitate towards people who share similar values and beliefs such as ourselves, be it book clubs drinking buddies church groups etc. Not saying that these outrageous and societally detrimental beliefs shouldn't be curbed (see above video of disgusting human beings). However it's really hard to change deep set beliefs when there is somebody to affirm their beliefs.

 Everytime I have confronted a family member or the family as a whole they laugh and chalk it up to me being unrealistic and not knowing how the real world works, this was before the rise of the empire that is social media. I don't disagree that it is definitely an accelerator of misinformation, however at a certain  point its an individuals responsibility to break from ignorance. And with the rapidly spreading false information realities out there available, it's easier than ever to choose to be ignorant. There was a time where you used to have to take an 'experts' words at face value because the alternative would be educating yourself to a level to be able to compete with said expert. Now I can just smash a few keys and have an endless amount of info in front of me.

 That being said fighting this seems like a real uphill battle, simply disagreeing causes more dissent, ignoring it allows it to run rampant. The only real solution is to meet individuals one on one on their level and try and dissect their arguments and 'evidence'. When it's as easy as checking your phone to put your original arguably in correct views back at the top of your mind it's next to impossible. So what's to be done, should it be us fighting each other on things that don't matter? I think that will just cause a greater divide. I think we need to hold the people who are benefiting from this division responsible, the ones making profit off dissent. There was a time doctors were told and proven too that oxycotin wasn't addictive and a cure all, it wasn't the doctors fault for believing them when they were shown 'evidence' that it was right. It was on pharmaceutical companies who profited off of creating drug addiction off of patients. We need to correct the source of the problem not the individuals who got swept up in the commotion.

Dr. Paul who wrote the acceptance reading, whose story is ""Doctor. Alcoholic. Drug Addict."" in the Third Edition of the Big Book, ""Acceptance is the Answer"" in the Fourth Edition, agreed that drug addiction has no place in AA in a 1995 ""Grapevine"" article.

The more authoritative long form of Tradition Three says AA is for alcoholics. The short form was condensed from the long form and both were adopted simultaneously in 1949 meaning any interpretation must conform to both forms.

AA works because an alcholic can best identify with another alcoholic. There is no comparison with the likes of heroin, LSD, &amp; fentenyl with alcohol in potency, effects on the body, and behaviors including degree of dishonesty and unlawfulness and acceptance by society. 

The courts have forced drug addicts on us making them too numerous to be booted as was the justifiable practice at one time.

Besides, a drug addict whose home is NA or any of the singular drug addiction 12-step programs  can best identify with another drug addict and would otherwise swell the ranks and increase the number of NA meetings and other drug addiction 12-step programs.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Wanting to go back to old normal heroin isn't trashy. It's like saying ""Maybe we shouldn't have 99% thc concentrates and should all go back to smoking joints."" 99% THC is essentially the crack of marijuana.

&gt; rights such as in Cuba or east Germany

Again the classic of Cuba or DDR. Cuba legalized it and started approaching due to their falling back towards capitalism; in fact the legalization of Homosexuality in Cuba is a direct result of their reaproachement with imperialist intelectuals who pushed to them the *unscientific* view that Homosexuals are just born that way. If you read the documents on why Cuba decided to legalize it, you will see that the Cubanese legistrators had propably not read ""After the Ball"", and they were obviously fooled by the imperialists, and are keep being played for idiots to this very day.

But this is not the only thing; cuba has in fact since the 70s activelly going back towards capitalism. I doupt any serious revolutionary sees Cuba and says ""this is what i want to have"". Most serious revolutionaries when they see to the world towards examples they see DPRK and see ""this is what we need"". They view Cuba as a degenarative version of DPRK going quickly back to capitalism with every passing year since the 70s.

Regarding DDR, the reasons were *completelly different*. It was in fact *a weakness* from the government to activelly fight sabotage from the West German Republic that forced their hands towards this. nonetheless, the government (contrary to Cuba) was never positive about Homosexuality, and anyone who wants to know more about the position of it, should read [the book of  Walter Hollitscher, Der überanstrengte Sexus](https://www.helle-panke.de/de/topic/7.antiq..?productId=67662) to see how the goverment thought of the topic, to see how completelly different were the reasons for Cuba (which accepted the theory of the imperialists) and the Germans who did not at all accept the theory of the imperialists at all.

&gt;I also find it disturbing that you would describe the violence Homosexuals endured as “funny”

What is disturbing is you trying to teach us what a communist should do by making obvious your allegiance to imperialism; the whole package is there: love for degenaracy, denying the labour aristocracy (and therefore imperialism itself) and oppossition to whatever army is currently fighitng the imperialists of the war today.

&gt;This isn’t the first time you and others on this sub Reddit have shown a callous disregard to the violence that homosexuals endure, with members of your moderators describing them as pedophiles.

Oh look at that! u/bolshevikboy got informed by r/genzedong and this is why he wants now to brigade the sub and make it just another debate on homosexuals! 

&gt;You’re very comment shows this associating the US imperialist forces with homosexuality. 

Exactly. I am not implying it, i am explicitly stating it.

&gt;I think it would be best if you stopped making baseless accusations about what I believe.

Baseless? I just stated what you really believe, and what the conclusions of your thoughs are. I am doing you a favor here by cutting the bullshit and going straight to the point.

&gt; Gaddafi was a progressive leader who brought land reform, secularism, workers and women’s rights.

Here again u/bolshevikboy reminds the reader just how ignorand he is about the topics he wants to discuss.
Libya under Gaddafi was *an islamic country*, with Gaddafi himself saying that [any law besides tradition and relegion is illogical.](http://openanthropology.org/libya/gaddafi-green-book.pdf). The very green flag of Libya is representing Islam. Regarding women, it is true but not as u/bolshevikboy is imagining it.

&gt;Not to mention on principle I oppose any imperialist endeavor.

The entirety of your comments say something else; they say that you oppose only imperialist endeavors you consider worse from what was already existing. Which is to say, your position is not princibled, it is opportunistic and for sure not an opposition to ""any"".

&gt; I was stating that it does not mean we should start praising Saddam or his policies. 

There are many things to be praised, one of them is that the iraqi Baath is currently waging a war against USA and their puppets in the region.

&gt;but there are better options than supporting either the fundamentalist women murdering taliban or the bomb throwing imperialist US. 

I give you a second strike for again repeating imperialist propaganda, rule 2 and 3. A third strike and you are banned.

&gt;There are socialist groups or parties we can support. 

There are none. The few ""socialist"" parties were in legue with the colloborators till 2 months ago.

&gt;One last thing I’d like to add, you are more strasserite than marxist my friend, 

u/bolshevikboy goes to name calling when he cant counter the arguement of the one he is debating.

&gt;Monogamy? Who gives an actual fuck

720,2021-11-04 19:46:47+00:00,"1. Empathy is a liability in a for-profit system. Working urgent care, I used to see patients walk away because they couldn't pay even though they had serious complaints like severe chest pain. My paycheck shouldn't be based on how many people get hurt or sick but in a for-profit system, that is the reality of the US healthcare system. 


2. Pharmaceuticals are simply one part of treatment. The United States is not the only country that develops new drugs. Other countries have other drugs that are not found in the US. Pharmaceutical companies in the US are also willing to push their products on healthcare providers because they profit from every prescription written. See: Purdue Pharma and Oxycotin. Many people became addicted because it was falsely advertised as a non-addictive alternative for pain management. I have seen the ramifications of this first-hand, taking care of elderly patients who have become dependent on these drugs. Developing treatment *methods* is a global effort. Studies on new techniques are done in collaboration between countries. One study is done in one country, another country replicates that study to add to the body of research that everyone around the world benefits from.


3. For-profit systems put profit above all else. Good patient outcomes are an obstacle to making profits because making sure a patient gets the best care takes time and time is money. Paying and treating staff properly, giving them benefits, all that costs money. In a for-profit system, those are the things that will get cut. I work 12 hours and am allowed one 30min lunch break. The failures of a for-profit system should have been clear with the pandemic.",1

Here, any controlled substances are hard to get a Dr to prescribe. I  can't get Xanax anymore for anxiety because they don't believe I need it. I never abused it and I was never addicted to it, but because I'm an addict they believe I'm an addict with everything. Nothing could be further from the truth. And our Healthcare system is horrible.",2
722,2021-11-04 16:46:30+00:00,"First of all, our government is not a faceless entity. It is us. All of use tell other people what they can or cannot do. We have no choice in the matter (unless someone does it illegally, of course). Even the first amendment - freedom of speech, press, etc is not without limits, limits that we ourselves decide. These are pretty rote examples: no yelling fire in a theater, no honking in hospital zones, etc. For the press, there's not ultimate freedom - libel is a thing.

As other example of ""ownership"" - people think that their children belong to them. For sure, they do not. Children belong to themselves, parents are just temporary guardians. If parents do a great job, or even medium job or por job,  then all's well. But if you have parents that are *horrible* parents - we've all read cases of this, no need for examples - then the government, meaning all of *us*, have the absolute right to take children away from their parents. Because children ultimately do not belong to their parents. Children  belong to all of us, because who wants a child fucked up by parents unleashed on society as serial killers or whatever. Or the child dying. So we, the people, are ultimately responsible for all children. End of story. There's no argument about that. 

Now let's take it another level into the person body -  your body does not 100% belong to you under certain circumstances. For example, if you commit a crime and go to jail, then there you are. You have no freedom to leave. Your body does not belong to you. Same with if you join the armed forces. You can't just quit - your ass belongs to the military. And the military can inject you with what they want - anti-anthrax if they think their people are in danger of that. Anti-malaria injections if going to fight in a malaria ridden country.

To your point of putting stuff in your body, I assume that you realize from the above examples, that you see where this is going. You do not have the right to put whatever you want to in your own body. For example, a person is not allowed to drink lye or ammonia. Do that, and it is a trip to the state mental hospital, if they catch you in time. They will strap you down. For sure. In a straight jacket. You just can't do what you want with your own body, because all of us have decided this. As usual, if someone does this with no one else around, they can. But that's not my point. More examples: nobody is allowed to stick a knife in their body to kill themselves or cut their wrists to kill themselves. Pepole can't eat C4 explosives as that could be construed as a potential to create an act of terrorism. You might argue that drugs or alcohol are not the same thing, but I'm not arguing that point. I'm just saying that our government (all of us voters) can tell each other what to do, what is acceptable, what we can do with our own bodies. Personally, I see alcohol and drugs as slow suicide. As hurting society. The toll of alcohol - nobody can deny, worst drug ever. And of course, everyone is aware of Oxycodon, which has killed so many people, and fucked up their families in so many ways.

Fetanyl I guess makes you forget.  A friend on the local rescue squad was telling me about people they've found just wandering lost when they weren't even a mile away from their own home.

I really like and agree with Gabor Mate's perspective on addiction.  It's more of a symptom of something else that went wrong in the past than it is a disease or sickness that we just pick up off others.  Sort of like some people can have alcohol and no problem with it and others don't stop until they're incoherent (many admitting that they're drinking to drown out memories).  Just some thoughts in case it helps at all.",1
743,2021-11-03 23:34:39+00:00,"Ich hab mich an Psilocybin und LSD nie ran getraut. Da ich eine sehr unschöne Kindheit hatte, mit viel Gewalt und ich wurde mit Angst erzogen.

Ich hab lange Therapie gemacht und bin stabil. Aber trotzdem weiß ich nicht ob ich jedes Traumata so gut integriert habe.

Ein Freund von mir hatte mal einen Horrortrip im Wald auf Pilzen. Er hatte auf einmal große Angst...
Die andren haben ihn dann abgelenkt.

&gt;Nehme das Zeug natürlich nur in guter und vertrauter Umgebung und meistens ist ein Tripsitter dabei.

Das ist gut. So halte ich es auch mit MDMA, nur ohne Sitter, da brauch ichs nicht. Aber das Setting muss stimmen.
Ist für mich nichts im Club ich fühle sonst alles von den andren und bin völlig überfordert. 


&gt;Das es danach allen wunderbar ging, halte ich für ziemlich ausgeschlossen.

Wahrscheinlich hast du recht.

&gt;Ich sags mal so: Microdosing (1-2 gramm pro Tag als Zitronentee) sind nicht wirklich gefährlich, aber höhere Dosen jeden Tag überlasten deine Psyche enorm auf Dauer. 

Ein ziemlich durchgeknallter Bekannter, er hatte auch schon eine Drogenpsychose mit Anfang20, kann es aber nicht lassen (jetzt 30) und meint er nimmt LSD microdosing als Anti-Migräne-Prophylaxe. Was denkst du darüber?

Ich hab viel über LSD und die Entdeckung, Forschungen gelesen. 
T.C. Boyles Roman über Timothy Leary ""das Licht"" wirklich gut. 
Kenne einige schöne Geschichten von Freunden.


Ich hatte einen Horrortrip über 6 Tage lang auf Oxycodon, Set/ Setting: nach einer großen OP im Krankenhaus allein im Zimmer mit unfreundlichen Schwestern und einer grauenhaften Hexe von Nachtschwester. Es war echt schrecklich.
 Ich wusste am 2ten Tag nicht mal mehr meinen Namen, wer ich bin...
Das Personal hat mir nicht geglaubt dass es mir wg dem Morphin schlecht geht !! -_- 



&gt;Aber bei meinem Bruder, er hatte starke Depressionen, haben Weed und Psychodelica eine schlimme Psychose ausgelöst, aufgrund eines üblen Badtrips. 

Das tut mir Leid. 
Wie geht's ihm mittlerweile?
Ist er wieder ganz fit?

So… yess i am a tramadol expert. I really liked the way the work. With oxy i must re-use every 2/3 hours with tramadol not. I could easily quit tramadol for a week (sleeping was fuckd up etc). And then start again fresh.

I miss them but the risk of addiction is to big for me. When i got used to the oxy i could easily take 250/500mg tramadol while a year before 50mg a day was way more then enough.

784,2021-11-02 10:46:38+00:00,"I can't honestly say what is causing the liver enzyme elevation, or what effect reducing or eliminating dose would be.

For myself, one person, always had elevation in bilirubin (1 unit above lab cut-off.)

It, and other enzymes, though non-critically, increased more when I had a heart attack and at that time began several medications for a heart issue, CHF management, and Lipitor. Some I have stopped (Plavix, for example). I drink 1 can of Pepsi per day and 1-2 cups of coffee. Vegetarian diet.

I'm monitored every 3 months (though I've gotten it to 6 and when in the ER since COVID became an issue).

When I began taking pain medications (Norco 20/325, then with Percocet 5/325 for breakthrough pain, then Perocet 10/325 when Norco became C-II) and anxiety medications (Oxazepam then Lorazepam). I did not see any increase with these, though some increase would certainly have been plausible.

Now I take Kratom, 15-22 grams per day over the last 4 years. I have not had any change when I was forced to switch off Percocet and forced to stop Lorazepam. My enzymes have remained the same. My weight has been between 91kg and 75kg, now 79kg.

All that to say--it is really hard to say what may lead to changes in your liver enzyme levels and the only real option is to taper down use of those substances, improve diet, and be re-tested to see if there is a correlation. I can't say which is the most important to stop sooner (for your liver, or which are more important for you.)

I know it can be difficult and I wish you all the best.

In general, I think 10 gpd is not consequential for most otherwise healthy people, especially compared to alternatives. It's also a low enough amount that a person can slowly taper off in a reasonable amount of time if they need to.

Covid studies showing lab related origin of the virus.

Showing who funded the most frequently cited study saying that Covid didn't come from a lab. It's Jack Ma, literally directly funds the lab that published that study, in collaboration with a sub lab that is staffed by people who also work in the Wuhan lab. As directly cited in their own research papers.

That last one is the most frustrating. Because I can nail down every aspect of it literally from direct primary sources. And it's still banned.

Ok that's quite an extraordinary claim and several needlessly vague ones. I can see why askscience would ban you. You make even basic fact checking an annoyance by being unclear about your claims. It's a clear mark of duplicity and why most would not tolerate you.

Thankfully for you, our standards are much lower at theydidthemath. As per rule 8, you merely need to demonstrate existence of the ""peer reviewed papers"" and/or "" direct primary sources"" you claim to have. Please do so and your comment will be restored.

Here it is:

In the future, you can just ask for sources. Thank you in advance for restoring my comment and acknowledging that I did in fact have the sources you claimed to not exist.

That's literally what I asked for in the present.

you claimed to not exist.

I didn't claim they didn't exist, I asked you to provide them because merely saying they exist is not sufficient. The burden of proof is on you, I asked you to meet that burden.

Thank you in advance for restoring my comment

No need to thank me because your comment won't be restored, if you bothered to actually click on the DOI hyperlink and verify the peer review status of the paper you shared you would see this important disclaimer at the TOP of the page.

Consistently critical peer review has been received that this record does not follow the norms of scientific rigour or balance, and thus the main claims may not stand the test of scientific scrutiny.

The paper is in clear disrepute and would not satisfy rule 8.

This is the level of intellectual dishonesty that I expect from a political mod. It's sad to see it here.

I was asked to provide a source for /r/askscience banning peer reviewed papers. I provided that source. If that source doesn't meet the scientific rigors of ""some other website"", that's not my problem.

Hopefully someday you'll be able to see the damage to public discourse you're doing by being so openly okay with censoring people you disagree with.

LMAO, nothing about this was dishonest and nothing is lost by public discourse except for your disingenuous presentation of information.

I was asked to provide a source for r/askscience banning peer reviewed papers. I provided that source. If that source doesn't meet the scientific rigors of ""some other website"", that's not my problem.

This is some serious duplicity here. It's not some other website, it's Zenodo the repository in which the paper you cited is deposited. You can click on the DOI on the link you sent to get there. The fact that you clearly don't know what a DOI is or call Zenodo ""some other website"" is why your opinion on what counts as dishonesty and what counts as censorship means nothing.

Was your paper peer reviewed? Yes, and the peer review found that your paper lacked scientific rigor.

No where in reasonable discourse is that considered anything but bullshit.

""You can't fail me, the test only said I had to choose a question, it never said I had to answer it, or that the answers had to be correct.""

"" You said I needed to show identification to buy alcohol, who cares if it's someone else's ID. That's not my problem""

Or being more specific, a time where ive been come to the point that id take them when i made enough money and got my hands on them. At the beginning i just took them occasionally. But it became more and more, and after a while i noticed i was getting really sick when i dont take them. It became physically painful. And as i couldnt afford that ammount of oxycodon i switched over to heroine. Its crazy how similar the high is, i prefered the percs, but as i said i since then just took them when i made a decent bag and normally i took the dogfood. Now im in an substitution program, trying to manage my life again. Although its tough not to fall back to old habits. Im happy i never got addicted to xans, eventhough i was close to it. The withdrawal is even worse than from opioids. 

Yea thats my story basically. Dont get addicted plz. It happens quicker than you think. I tought i had the control. But these type of drugs are uncontrollable. You can be good for day, months, even years maybe. But there will be the time when something really bad happens in your life. Let it be loosing your job, your boy/girlfriend or the loss of a loved one. And then you know what 'medicine' you can take to heal the pain...",2
