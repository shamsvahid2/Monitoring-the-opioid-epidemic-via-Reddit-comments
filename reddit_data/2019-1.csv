A dozen pain sufferers and their supporters rallied in front of the County Administration Center Tuesday to bring attention to an often overlooked consequence to the battle on opioids: the failure to adequately treat chronic, debilitating pain.

The “Don’t Punish Pain” rally in San Diego was among several held across the country asking lawmakers to consider the needs of chronic pain patients when drafting measures that restrict access to opioids.

They point to data that shows most people fatally overdose on illicit opioids, such as fenanyl or heroin, and not on medication prescribed to them.

“Why am I being punished?” asked Rhonda Favero, a pain patient who organized the local rally with her husband. “I follow all the rules.”

Favero, like many chronic pain patients these days, has had her opioid treatment tapered due to external pressures put on doctors, pharmacies and the healthcare industry as a whole in response to the opioid epidemic gripping the nation. As a result, she said her pain has grown worse and is significantly impacting her ability to do the things she used to.

17,2019-01-30 02:24:31+00:00,"Hey man, I am a fellow Vancouverite myself!  Happy to answer some of your glaring questions that I had myself when I was in your position over 3 years ago.

1.  Yes, I waited about 11 months for my surgery and I had it completed at the Delta Hospital.  I have had 2 other friends come to me about this question and they had the same waiting period.  So as per /u/sufficientbee was saying, it might vary between surgeons.
2. Strengthening all the muscles around (hamstrings, calves, quads, IT band, glutes, etc) are very essential to have a smoother recovery.  I didn't do this and I continued playing sports with a brace on and trust me, it's not worth it.  I still regret it to this day as it hinds my physical activity now.  Also, having a protocol with your PT is essential, before and after surgery protocol that is.
3. You should try staying away from doing any exercises that require lateral movement, sudden jolts, pretty much any movements that might require you to turn quickly, landing on that leg, etc.
4. As per /u/sufficientbee as well, surgery is covered by MSP.  As you're 16 and don't have your own insurance, be sure to check with your parents/guardians insurance to ensure that their insurance covers the surgery ahead of time (sooner rather than later!)

To answer your new question, it is very easy to retear an ACL if you don't properly strengthen your leg according to your rehabilitation protocol.  Don't run before you can walk, take the recovery slow and don't neglect working your muscles everyday.  This is **VERY** important!  Be sure you also focus on getting your ROM (Range of Motion) back to where it once was, or just simply compare your good leg to bad leg and try to get it to be the same in ROM. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry to say, the fear never goes away.  There is a mental block where you cannot *FULLY* trust your leg like how you once did.  I know of people (who are much better athletes than myself) who got a full recovery and worked like hell to get over the fear itself.  However, a piece of advice would be to trust in the process. What I mean by that, is to put in the work required to fully rehab and then slowly ease your way back into sports/lifting/whatever have you.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Good piece of advice that I wish people told me:** Buy a icing machine, one that's specifically good for ACL reconstructions.  One that is relatively good on the market is ""Breg Kodiak"".  There are some PT places that rent out their icing machines but it's pretty rare.  I've only heard of this happening to my friends, not for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

**MUST** **Ice. Every. Day.** // Please also be aware that the painkillers are going to suck.  I'm not sure what you'll be prescribed, I got oxycodon and I had the scariest dreams and I sweat buckets and I felt like I was losing my mind sometimes (bear you I had to be in bed when it was like 34 degrees at the time).  If possible, opt for T3s instead of Oxycodon, unless you're down to try a crazy ass PK.

36,2019-01-28 22:15:39+00:00,"I can help answer that. In the '80s distributors from Xalisco Mexico began selling 'black-tar' heroin around the United States using a phone operator-delivery driver model. These distributors set up in rural areas and small towns and explicitly did not sell to, or work with black people. This practice slowly spread across the United States, hidden in an unexpected demographic: rural and suburban white kids.

In your top level comment, you say ""Doctors aren't the problem."" However, in the '90s pharmaceutical companies like Purdue Pharma marketed Oxycontin and other opiates as non-addictive to patients who are in pain. They sent salespeople to legally bribe doctors at their offices across the states and paid for conferences to push their 'miracle drug.'

This culminated in a one-two punch as addicted Americans becoming tolerant of oxycodine, hydrocodone, and others found relief in a cheaper and easier source: black tar heroin.

The best advice i would give is to taper well.  Make sure she takes tiny tiny amounts and i mean she needs to cut whatever pill she is taking into 1/4s and 1/8ths depending on which opioid she is currently addicted to.  All opiates have different half lifes and bioavailabillities, but with that said generally you would start by seeing how many pills she has to work with cut those pills up into small pieces not enough to get you high and just enough to stop withdrawals, this is a very important step and many addicts fail here because the mind will justify taking extra, but even if you stumble just pick up where you left off one day of stumbling wont hinder the progress.  

take the cut up small small dose of the pills and take  3x a day for a week (morning lunch night) if you can take less if you start feeling the high you dont want to feel the high.

 then 2x a day once in the  morning and once night for a week then 1x in the morning for a week, then 1x in the morning once every two days, then once in the morning every 3 days and then 4 and then 5 days. 

I don't know how bad she is feeling the withdrawals so obviously you want to take less if you can, 

 I've never tapered with short acting opioids like hyrdrocodone, oxycodone, hydro morphone, oxymorphone, but i used this taper method with suboxone through a doctor and for the first time in my whole life i've successfully quit opiates with no withdrawal symptoms at all.  The only negatives were the cravings and the occasional light sweats only in bed and a little anxiety.  All which were completely manageable for me while holding down a full time pool cleaning job and going to school.

I've had opana, methadone, hydrocodone and everything inbetween.

Than in 2010 I started to get tapered. Told Ixwasnt really in pain . Then in 2011 basically cut me off comp letely.

When I asked why I needed anything, I'd ask why the fuck did you rate me 100% if nothing is wrong.

After the withdrawals, I was left in pain. The only thing the V.A would give is tramadol. A script would last me about a week or two as I'd double/triple the dose despite the seizure warnings just to keep from blowing my brains out in insufferable misery in pain.

Then suffer through until I could renew the script.

Then I got married in 2017. I got private health insurance. In jan of 2018 I handed my primary care my imaging and walked out with a script for 10/325 hydrocodone.

For the first time in nearly 7 years I felt hope again that my.life would improve. I wasnt an asshole every waking moment as my body was no longer overwhelmed with constant pain.

Now since trump revamped the va, they are paying to send me to pain management, chiropractic and a 1 hour massage therapy once a week.

However, even now I still feel like I'm treated like an addict or a potential addict. Or treated with skepticism even though I have xrays and MRIs and diagnoses galore since 2007 starting in the army.

I always feel like I have to prove I'm in pain. It's all so fuxking jading.

And now I've become tolerant to my hydro dose. Their answer was stop it or keep it the same.

Of course that was BS based on greed. The maker of Oxy also makes suboxone the so called cure for opioid addiction. So they double the profits. They aggressively sold and promoted their product to doctors gave out free samples, sent doctors to wonderful seminars in far off places and sold us on a synthetic version of morphine all in an effort to make money. Greed is the killer. ",2
62,2019-01-27 02:45:24+00:00,"Drs are not giving people opium. Opiate painkillers do two things they make you feel awesome and they kill pain. Oxycoton and morphine etc dont make you feel as awesome as opium and they have legitimate medical uses. Most doctors were not selling oxy to get rich because they had money already because they were doctors. They were duped by addicts and the medical kbowledge of the time. Also oxy was still a controlled substance.

I read about that crazy pill mill and shit like that will happen. 

I noticed this really cool pattern that heroin epidemics follow so in the 50s heroin was huge then in the late 70s this latest epidemic started in the 2000s. So that says heroin goes in 30 year cycles. Which reminds me of this thing I read that said crackheads and the stigma that comes along with being an addict is the most effective anti drug. This generation decided to find out what heroin was about and they fucked up.  The next generation wont.

Those epidemics were different because they didn't sell opium as a painkiller(they did sell heroin and morhphine as pain killers). They sold it as a drug. Are bars responsible for alcoholics or are drunks responsible for themselves? If you misuse a drug and shirk your responsibilities then you are wholly responsible not the drug.",1

67,2019-01-26 20:18:05+00:00,"I like natural medicines, for instance I quite often use a derivative of willow trees to cure headaches, works very well and its very cheap and its nearly side effect free... It's called aspirin.

Another great natural madicine I sometimes use is derived from mold spores as it's great for killing certain bacteria... Though many are resistant to it, there are many times when it's okay to take it... This is penicillin.


When there is extreme amounts of pain a lot of people take medicines derived from poppies to help manage pain... These medicines include codeine, morphine, dimorphine, and many many more.



In fact many medicines that we have are derived from plants and other sources. Now the reason why doctors prescribe it in pill form instead of telling you to go to your local greenhouse has many reasons: 

1) some plants that we use to derive medicines from are toxic and as such we can pull the medicine out for beneficial reasons without risk of poisoning the user. 

2) concentration, some plants (like poppies) are already super concentrated and as such distillation is pretty much all that is required... Other plants (say willow tree bark) are less concentrated... We used to get around this by boiling things in teas as that would leach some of these compounds and by boiling off some water we could increase the concentration, however we didn't understand why... But it is still far more effective to use the medicine itself which is safely concentrated. 




Now specific to your girlfriend, she should see a doctor... Some of her issues could be solved through diet and excersize (potentially) but some of her issues are serious medical conditions that need more involved medicines, likely SSRI's.

69,2019-01-26 16:41:30+00:00,"I'm in a shitty position in family practice right now in that I don't have my own patient panel, and at least half of the physicians I work with (the ones who should really be retired already) have atrocious prescribing habits. I've seen many patients on *more than one benzo* scheduled multiple times per day, often with oxycontin, dilaudid, and oxcodone IR for breakthrough pain. Sometimes it's someone with some really traumatic history of motorcycle accident or whatever, but more often than not it's an overweight 50-something person with back pain. I hate it, but I'm also expected to refill many of these when someone is on vacation or just out of the office. They're not ""my"" patient and I didn't start them. 

When I do give a new rx for benzodiazepines it is almost always situational and/or short term. So a couple for use in getting through dental work/flights? Fine. 10-20 to help around the acute grief phase after the death of a family member? You bet. Sometimes I'll even prescribe some for someone in crisis while we're starting an SSRI and getting it ramped up. But I always explain them as much like a rescue inhaler for asthma -- a great and important med, and I want it to be there and useful to them if they need it. If they're taking it every day, then the anxiety is not well-controlled and we need to do something else. That seems to be a useful analogy for most of my patients.",32

 A seleção brasileira jogará, no mínimo, em São Paulo, duas vezes, na estreia, [no Morumbi (14/6)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/09/morumbi-e-confirmado-como-palco-da-abertura-da-copa-america.shtml), e no terceiro jogo, em Itaquera (22/6), além de jogar em Salvador (18/6).

 E pode seguir nos mata-matas por Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte e Rio.

 Nesta quinta-feira (24) serão conhecidos os adversários da fase de grupos na carioca Cidade das Artes.

 Se tudo der certo, a seleção brasileira passará pelas cinco capitais do eixo mais poderoso do futebol nacional, o que abriga as 13 maiores torcidas do país.

 A CBF deseja permitir maior contato do time com a massa e [não o esconderá em Teresópolis](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/folhanacopa/2014/02/1419094-treinos-da-selecao-brasileira-serao-fechados-para-torcida.shtml) ao evitar o desgastante bate-volta da Copa do Mundo de 2014, repetido na Rússia com as idas e vindas a Sochi.

 Parece a melhor medida do ponto de vista técnico e busca tornar os jogadores mais acessíveis a seus fãs diante da constatação de que não é simpática a imagem da seleção.

 De fato, faz tempo, a seleção mais chateia que alegra, com rápida interrupção durante a Copa das Confederações de 2013, quando [derrotou a Espanha campeã mundial](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/folhanacopa/2013/06/1304007-brasil-vence-a-espanha-no-maracana-e-conquista-sua-quarta-copa-das-confederacoes.shtml) na final no Maracanã.

 Então, a torcida cantou ""o campeão voltou"".

 É isso. O torcedor brasileiro gosta mesmo é de ganhar, embora, paradoxalmente, até hoje ame o time derrotado na Copa de 1982.

 O vôlei virou fenômeno por aqui porque ganha sem parar entre mulheres e homens e o basquete ficou esquecido porque só perde, apesar de ter sido o segundo esporte quando vencia, [bicampeão mundial em 1959/63](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/esporte/fk2312200811.htm).

 O automobilismo virou febre graças a Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet e [Ayrton Senna](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/10/ha-30-anos-senna-conquistava-1o-titulo-e-status-de-heroi-com-vitoria-epica.shtml). Mas passou.

 Já Guga fez o Brasil parar para ver jogos de tênis.

 Com o time de futebol a relação sempre foi de amor e ódio.

 Tanto que se diz ser preciso sair do Brasil vaiado para ganhar Copas do Mundo, como aconteceu em quatro das cinco Copas vencidas. A exceção ficou com a de 1962, no Chile, a do bicampeonato.

 Só que a questão hoje em dia é de outro tipo.

 Nelson Rodrigues, antes do tricampeonato conquistado em 1970 pela seleção tida como a melhor de todos os tempos, escreveu sobre o embarque: ""Partiu o escrete. Terminou o seu exílio.""

 A imagem da CBF, mesmo entre quem veste a camisa em manifestações políticas, é a legada por [João Havelange](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2016/joao-havelange/), [Ricardo Teixeira](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2017/06/1896586-nao-ha-lugar-mais-seguro-para-estar-do-que-o-brasil-diz-ricardo-teixeira.shtml), [José Maria Marin](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2017/12/1946218-marin-vai-do-luxo-em-nova-york-para-prisao-de-terceiro-mundo.shtml) e [Marco Polo Del Nero](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/12/grupo-ligado-a-del-nero-ganha-licitacao-na-cbf.shtml), os quatro cavaleiros do apocalipse.

 Não serão o [anedótico coronel Nunes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/02/colecionador-de-gafes-coronel-nunes-preside-cbf-sem-se-expor.shtml) e o [golpista Caboclo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/jucakfouri/2018/03/o-golpe-desta-vez-aconteceu-na-cbf.shtml), assessorados pelo secretário-menor, capazes de mudar tal estado de coisas, nem mesmo com a conquista da Copa América, no máximo uma alegria fugaz.

 Basta constatar o que rapidamente aconteceu com a imagem vencedora de Tite.

 Em busca de simpatia, a CBF já usou as figuras de Ronaldo Fenômeno, Bebeto, Cafu, além de outros menos votados. Em vão, ou, até, com efeito contrário para os próprios.

 Agora especula-se em torno de Kaká, mais um equilibrista, crítico mas nem tanto, em vias de ser cooptado em nome da missão impossível.

 Não serão os que aí estão os responsáveis por fazer da Casa Bandida do Futebol algo acolhedor e confiável.

 Nem os neopentecostais.

Thats when I switched to Oxcodone 10mg.  When I was actually having a stone, I'd take 4 to 8 in a 24 hour period.  This is the drug that escalated the problem. I would take 1 or 2 a day to just keep myself from going into withdrawal.

Even fetanyl, an opioid which in concentrated forms can kill you in an amount equal to two grains of sand, is used in anesthesia and is safe when balanced with the right chemicals in the right amount.

Mercury is fine to ingest or even be injected in your bloodstream in small amounts. Certain fish contain mercury and are perfectly safe to eat, but if you eat too much you can poison yourself.

Instead of having Mexicans (i understand that most go a different route, but there are still quite a few that chose this one) trying to use the cartels to cross the border illegally, lets make that not a viable solution. Lets give them a path to become an american and instead of making Americans chase the ones that cross. lets reroute that energy to helping them find a safer and easier way in that doesn't abandon family or put them in harms way.

------

 O drama de Alfonso Cuarón, sobre a vida de uma empregada doméstica durante os conturbados anos 1970 no México, está disponível na Netflix. Mas há sessões especiais programadas para amanhã, em cinemas de Florianópolis, Palmas e Niterói (no Cine Arte UFF). Ingressos à venda no site eventbrite.com.br. Havendo oportunidade, é um desses filmes que merecem ser vistos em tela grande.

 “A favorita”
------------

 Estrelado por Olivia Colman, Emma Stone e Rachel Weisz, o filme de época do grego Yorgos Lanthimos (de “O lagosta”, 2015) gira em torno de um triângulo amoroso numa corte inglesa do século XVIII. Estreia amanhã no Brasil.

 “Green book”
------------

 Mesmo envolto em polêmicas de bastidores, a dramédia de Peter Farrelly teve cinco indicações. É a história de um motorista branco (Viggo Mortensen) que acompanha um pianista negro (Mahershala Ali) numa turnê. Estreia amanhã.

 “Vice”
------

 Dirigida por Adam McKay (de “A grande aposta”, 2015), a sátira política sobre a vida de Dick Cheney, ex-vice-presidente dos Estados Unidos, emplacou oito indicações. Estreia no Brasil em 31 de janeiro, mas ele já pode ser visto em uma sessão especial, sábado (26), no Estação Net Rio 4.

 “Pantera Negra”
---------------

 Com US$ 1,3 bilhão arrecadados no mundo, a aventura dirigida por Ryan Coogler é o terceiro filme mais rentável da história a ser indicado na categoria principal do Oscar, atrás apenas de “Avatar” (2009) e “Titanic” (1997). Pode ser visto no Now e no Telecine Play.

 “Nasce uma estrela”
-------------------

 O trágico musical de Bradley Cooper é a quarta versão da história (Hollywood produz remakes de “Nasce uma estrela” há décadas). Mas a química entre o diretor/ator e a cantora/atriz Lady Gaga dá liga a esse romance de dois músicos em busca do sucesso. Prepare lenços. Ainda está em cartaz no Cinemark Barra Downton e UCI New York City Center, e já pode ser visto no Now.

 “Bohemian Rhapsody”
-------------------

 O musical de Bryan Singer dividiu a crítica. Mas isso não impediu que o público e a indústria ficassem fascinadas com a história de Freddie Mercuty (Rami Malek), vocalista do Queen. Em cartaz no Cine Special Laura Alvim, no Cinemark Barra Downtown, no Cinemark Village Mall, no Cinépolis Lagoon, no Kinoplex Fashion Mall, no Roxy e no UCI New York City Center.

 “Infiltrado na Klan”
--------------------

 O filme de Spike Lee relata a história real de um policial negro que se infiltra no grupo racista Ku Klux Klan. Em cartaz no Cine Special Laura Alvim e no Estação NET Rio.

138,2019-01-22 22:09:51+00:00,Morphine is used mostly for post op. recovery or to treat extreme pain from traumatic injuries or pain management in late stage cancer. Dilaudid is mostly used for surgical anesthesia. All three are sometimes prescribed for chronic pain. The problem of addiction is a result of over-prescription for bullshit like back pain and arthritis. The fact of the matter is that the only known way to reliably reduce extreme pain is to stimulate the opioid receptors. Cannabinoids show a lot of promise for pain management but are still not well understood and certainly wouldn't do shit for a patient with a shattered femur or someone who just had their gall-bladder removed. We don't use heroin because of the stigma. Fentenyl and opana are arguably much stronger and have legitimate uses for inpatient situations. Its the outpatient prescriptions and the black market demand that cause all the social problems.,1
139,2019-01-22 21:21:42+00:00,"&gt;The schedules also consider the supposed abusability and addictiveness of the drugs alongside their medical use when scheduling the drugs.

Yes, that's why say, morphine and cocaine are schedule II, hydro and oxy codone mixed with acetominophen is III, etc. That reflects the view of lower abusablity. 

And Im not sure where you are, but in my state, the police blotters reflect heroin arrests as ""Class A"" substance, but marijuana arrests as ""Class D"" substances, and the sentences are significantly different.

Again, Marijuana is just on schedule I not because of direct danger, but because it wasn't allowed to be prescribed, and therefore it's only perceived use according to the schedule was for abuse. Again, now that states have allowed it's use, expect doctors and researchers to begin publishing papers that eventually see it fall lower in the schedules, if not off altogether. 

Quaaludes were elevated to schedule I after benzo's became established. Heroin (pharmaceutically) is no different than morphine, just stronger, but it's on Schedule I because of politics (it's a scary word, even though other, stronger pain killers are prescribed, and diactylmorphine is in widespread use elsewhere in the world). 

Likewise, and LSD, Ecstacy, Peyote have zero chance of addictability. LSD and Peyote have hardly any chance of fatal overdose. But all three occupy schedule I because, again, the only role they have in the eyes of DEA was for abuse. Again, my state lists them as Class C despite their presence on Schedule I.",2
140,2019-01-22 20:53:59+00:00,"I just still don't feel like your analogy is at all right here.

Fetanyl is like .01% of total pharmaceutical chemical production in the world.

Whereas roundup ready crops are on 250 million out of ~4 billion acres of farmland in the world. That means 1/16th of the land, and therefore much more than 1/16th of the crop output (especially in the developed world) is sprayed with Roundup. ",1

142,2019-01-22 19:37:07+00:00,"It's terrible when people with chronic pain can't get their meds anymore. Not every kind of pain responds well to opioids. But when needed and taken on a fixed schedule opioids don't have the same addictive potential as when they're taken on-demand. Everything is supposed to be smoooooth. No pain spikes, no stress, even-keel blood levels of the drug, nothing that gets the brain too enthusiastic for that next dose.

Now go and make that smooth treatment happen when patients can only have at home what they need in the next few days and all too often have problems to get their prescriptions/refills in time for the next dose. 

Oxycodon isn't the greatest substance to use as a pain killer to begin with. Too much of a euphoria kick right after a dose. That *can* be managed with a well-tailored schedule and dosage for the individual patient. That's not how it was promoted and used, though. I'm pretty sure that if it weren't for Purdue Pharma's insane claims and marketing campaigns for *decades,* the US wouldn't have (quite?) such a massive problem... which now spills and world-wide people get scared that opioids are the devil. To the detriment of those who actually need them.",5
143,2019-01-22 19:18:20+00:00,"It's actually really simple; laudanum had the status of ""legitimate medicine"", being endorsed by medical professionals, while opium had always been viewed as a harmful vice.   Really that's all the difference that was needed.   

It probably didn't help that opium was associated with non-white people; much as with the prohibition of marijuana, racial bias probably played a role.   

The dangers of opiates were understood to some degree even back in the 19th century nevertheless.   After the American Civil War, there was an epidemic of morphene-addicted veterans.    Enough that people thought that something ought to be done about it.    Funny how history can repeat itself.",28

Uma mudança legal nesse último episódio, além de vocalizar isso, é uma perspectiva diferente da anterior: Mob não está mais pensando só sobre perder o controle dos poderes, ele está pensando em perder o controle dos próprios desejos/impulsos e usar conscientemente esse poder, e isso carrega uma responsabilidade diferente. Também leva uma comparação interessante com o Saitama (em OPM) que apesar de ser o ápice de poder na sua série, relega toda a força como uma parte do hobby de herói dele: não há esse mesmo conflito porque o poder surgiu, e está portanto atrelado, do desejo de virar um heroi. O Mob, por outro lado, não desejou esse poder, e sim nasceu com ele; não existe uma intenção ou obrigação inerente de como ele deve usar seu dom como no caso anterior, e está atrelado a como ele acha que deve ser usado.

In 1766 the French sold the Port of Saint Louis to the Spanish, who renamed it to Puerto Soledad in 1767. The agreement was made under the stipulation that the French settlement would remain, so that the British would not gain de facto control of the islands and have their claims legitimized when the French pulled out.[1] 

In 1770 the Spanish expelled the British from Port Egmont, taking complete control of the islands. In 1771 Britain and Spain negotiated a treaty allowing the British to return to their settlement, with neither side relinquishing claims of sovereignty. In 1774 economic pressures from the mounting Revolutionary War in America the British withdrew, thought they did leave a plaque maintaining their claim, but by 1776 the Spanish had de facto control over the islands again.

From 1774 to 1811 the Falklands were ruled as part of the Viceroyalty of the River Plate, a precursor to Argentina. In 1777 the remains of the British settlement of Port Egmont were destroyed and the plaque claiming sovereignty was taken to Buenos Aires. 

In 1811 mounting pressure from the Argentinian War for Independence caused the Spanish to withdraw from the islands, but again the Spanish left behind a plaque claiming sovereignty.  When Argentina declared independence in 1816 under the ""United Provinces of the River Plate""[3] and claimed all sovereignty that was governed by the former Viceroyalty, including the Falklands.

However it wasn't until 1820 when the United Provinces frigate *Heroina* under the commander of American privateer David Jewett landed in Puerto Soledad after an eight month voyage which purportedly left the majority of the crew suffering from scurvy and disease. Jewett decided to rest and resupply on the islands. On November 6 1820 Jewett hoisted the flag of the United Provinces of the River Plate and officially claimed the islands for the new state.[4] Jewett gave a letter of his claim to an American schooner captain William Orne who took it home and had it published in his local newspaper on 8 June 1821. It wouldn't be until 10 November 1821 that it would finally be published in Buenos Aires itself, nearly a year after the declaration.

In 1823 the United Provinces government granted land on East Falkland to the merchant Luis Vernet, who departed for the islands the following year. His initial expedition immediately failed, and he would try again in 1826, only to fail again. In 1828 the United Provinces government granted all of East Falkland to Vernet including access to all its resources and exemption from tax if a functioning colony could be established within three years. Vernet first sought permission from the British government to proceed, the British wanted a report on the island, and Vernet requested protection should they return.

When Vernet returned to the islands Puerto Soledad was renamed to Port Luis. The United Provinces government appointed Vernet governor in 1829. One of his first acts was to enact laws restricting seal hunting in an effort to preserve dwindling seal populations. During this time Vernet seized three American ships for violating the seal hunting laws.[5]

This angered the Americans, who stated that they did not recognise Argentine sovereignty over the Falklands, and by 1831 had dispatched a warship, the *USS Lexington*, to ""retake confiscated property"". The captain of the Lexington reported he destroyed Port Luis' powder store and spiked guns, though later reports state the settlement was entirely destroyed. Vernet, who had returned to Buenos Aires before the Lexington's attack, resigned as governor in 1831. Vernet is to this day a controversial figure. While he operated as governor under the Argentine government, he also operated under British business licenses and under British protection.

Esteban José Francisco Mestivier was appointed as an interim governor by the Argentine government, to more protests from the British, and arrived in 1832 aboard the schooner *Sarandí*, captained by José María Pinedo. Mestivier was murdered by a mutiny in December 1832, and Captain Pinedo helped put down the mutiny, effectively becoming the default leader of Port Luis.

A British squadron had been dispatched to the Falklands to reclaim them from the United Provinces. HMS *Clio* under the command of Captain John Onslow arrived at Port Egmont on 20 December 1832, and was later joined by HMS *Tyne*. On 3 January 1833, the squadron sailed into Port Luis and demanded that the flag of the United Provinces of the River Plate be lowered, the British one be raised instead and that the Argentine administration leave the islands.

Heavily out manned and out gunned, Pinedo withdrew. And the Falklands have been under the control of the British ever since, except for the brief occupation by Argentine forces for 74 days in 1982. The Argentine government launched formal protests to the British government annually from 1833 to 1849, with one more in 1885. However since the 1885 protest there have been no further formal protests recognized by the British government until 1941. International law states that territorial claims become defunct after 50 years. [6]

**TL;DR**: In terms of ""de facto"" control over the Falkland Islands; first they belonged to the French, then the British, then the Spanish, then Argentinians (aka United Provinces of the River Plate at the time), then finally the British ever since 1833 except for a brief period during the Falklands War.

You're confusing reliable and uncontaminated with ""purer"" and stronger. It's not about purity in terms of drugs per volume. It's purity in terms of ""doesn't contain an opiate when you expect a stimulant"".

People getting fentalyl or carfentanyl when they expect blow or heroin is extremely dangerous. 

You say there is no safe quantity for opiates, yet you express concern about the ""drugs per volume"". Well which is it? Obviously quantity is extremely important, and to measure quantity accurately you need reliable products.

Yet for a while people thought inhibiting the CYP2D6 enzyme potentiated Codeine, but nowadays I read that it would be better to actually INDUCE the CYP2D6 enzyme. Drugs like Erythromycin, Carbamazepine.

It's a bit confusing and conflicting. The advice is also drink Grapefruit Juice an hour before to inhibit CYP3A4. But apparently with Codeine this plays a minor role in converting Codeine to Morphne.

I’ve regretted everything other than weed, dabs, and the coke. For the longest time, I wanted to fit in so I never said no and that’s how I was introduced to pain pills. I fell in love with them. They made me feel good and alleviated my back pain. Also made sex 40,000x better. I have a really hard time saying no to them no which is why I don’t put myself in situations where they are. But before, I’d always goin on little weekend hinges so I didn’t end up physically addicted like my friends. The suboxone strip I tried made me throw up. My friend was like, “hey stick this in your mouth.” And I did. Fuck that shit.

I was a forklift driver and another driver who’s a buddy of mine is like “Yo I got a present for you.” And we snuck out and snorted some off his dash of his car. Went back inside, felt like I could outrun the forklift. I was super productive. But it didn’t last long. Also made my parts of my mouth and nose numb. Don’t know if it’s possible to get addicted to coke. But, I probably would if I kept fucking with it and also could afford it (80/g). Mushrooms are interesting. Some people make teas out of them and shit. It just made everything brighter and colors more colorful. However, I didn’t eat as much as my buddy while we were fishing and he low key sat and stared at his fishin lure for about 30 minutes. My other buddy grows them and recommends your first few times doing it around someone you trust. Lastly, meth. It’s absolutely disgusting. I’ve done it 6x. Makes my chest hurt. The taste is awful. I get paranoid af. I get twitchy. Restless. When I sleep, it’s not good sleep. But, like I said I can rarely say no to drugs. Just don’t do it. I have more will power than I did before so I feel confident I could stand my ground but that doesn’t mean I put myself in those situations.

Also, I’m completely straight edge. The worse drug I’ve ever dealt with is nicotine, tbh. It’s hard to give up. The mental for that shit is ridiculous. It’s been weeks since I quit and I still get migraines after I eat because I want it so bad.

190,2019-01-19 13:35:08+00:00,"Yeah as said the dope wasnt very good. And yes we paid 25€ for a gramm. He first wanted 30€ for a g but we put em down to 25€. We werent in the major city. But in a big city. It was on the side of the train station there was smth like an old train stock hall and all the dealer sat there and even some (about 2 or 3 guys) had a table infront of them with a wage on it and some products, syringes, cookers etc laid there. And this dude we got the dope from first pointed us to one of these guys with the table to get pills. We first just wanted to buy some benzos and he then brought out a backpack and put out the blisters of different benzos. And then he asked us if we are interested in opioids too and we said yes. So he grabbed in his backpack and put out a Sandoz Oxycodon HCL 80mg pack with 28 pills. And I think we bought the whole thing. I know that I bought 10 pills for kyself cause I wasnt doing H back then. So I was super lucky about the oxy. I thought he would have some Tramadol or Tilidin (if that is even available in italy?) and he got fuckin Oxy. He had about 5 of these 28 pills boxes. And I remember perfectly that he said he will give them to us cheaper cause we already bought the benzos from him. He normally changes 10€ per pill. We were also a big group of 10 ppl so we werent concerned about being ripped off or anything cause all of us were tall and we had even brought our knives and other shit to fight. But yeah thats it. 

I am from Germany and we normally dont also have a pill game over here. But in the last 3-5 years it really changed in the bigger citys. There are still in every bigger city an open air drug markethere in Germany. I think it is the same in italy isnt it? But anyways before I started using daily Heroin I used Tramadol and Tilidin of my dad who died and he left many pills behind. Thats how I started my addiction, using pills to cope with the death of my dad. Anyways adter I run out of pills and I then had my first day of wds I went to the nearest bigger city with an open air market and asked arround for pills. First all they got were benzos and then someone pointed me in the right direction and I found some dude with the same Sandoz Oxy HCL 80mg for 5€ a pill. He had the German version with 50 pills in a box. 

But what I want to say is that mostly the European Countrys dont got a pill game like it is in the USA but if you directly search for it you can definitly find some Oxy, Morphine, Tramadol, Tilidin and there are also many guys in Germany who are in the Mdone programm and get a take home script and sell their mdone on the street. The same thing happens now that subutex and suboxone are used more and more, here in Germany, with subs too. But I know from some older ""friends"" that at least here in Germany they started selling benzos in the 90s on the streets too. Back then was flunitrazepam (rohypnol) a big thing. The guys who smoked off the foil made the rohypnol to powder and smoked it together with their gear and the guys shooting shot the rohypnol together with their gear, which is a nasty blue mix with a brown tan mixed in from the H. Shooting rohypnol, coke and H is called in Germany a Frankfurter schuß cause Frankfurt was one of the biggest heroin citys and it still is. 


And I also know that in the German Capital city you can get on the Kotti many pills too. There has build up the first pill scene, you can get there literally every pill which is available in Germany. And even some which arent since most of our street benzos for example are Galenika brand from Serbia. And I was about one month ago there too and bought many pills very cheap cause none of them were from a German pharmacy. All the opioids were from Eastern Europe or India, Pakistan and such countrys. And the benzos were mostly all from Galenika brand in Serbia. 

90% of the dealers there though only sold Heroin, Coke or meth. But 5% sold both pills and H. And another 5% only sold pills. And I saw many guys in Suites buying pills. So I think they may want to know what they use and are willing to pay more for their high. ",1

192,2019-01-19 04:03:13+00:00,"I'm not going to try to change anyone's mind about anything, but in the name of learning I will be leaving my anecdote here.

I am currently a 19 year-old college student, and I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease almost 3 years ago. The basics of the disease is that your immune systems attacks your intestines, and causes you pain, it can last all day for the most severe cases. For me, I went from a straight-A High School student with a 4.6 GPA to dropping out of UCI. This disease is crippling, on good days I would go to the restroom 10 times, and depending on what I ate it could be worse. My pain level was 6-7/10 constantly, it was absolutely humiliating trying to walk to class in pain, shitting myself, then having to walk back to my dorm. Life was absolute hell.

For me, I was raised with the firm belief that any non-prescription drugs are absolutely unacceptable. My father was a hard-core drug dealer, and did over 5 years or prison time just while I've been alive. My mom always said that she'd swear me off should I ever dabble in drugs. I never smoked, drank, or even drink coffee, I wanted my body to be clean, but once the pain started kicking in I was begging the doctors for any relief.

When the pain first started I was having the absolute maximum amount of Tylenol you could have a day, and it wouldn't even cover half of my time awake, let alone getting up at 11pm, 2 am, and 5 am every night with excruciatingly painful diarrhea. I constantly interacted with my standard physician, my gastroenterologist, and even a pain doctor for how to deal with this pain. We tried several medicines, but with Crohn's you have much less options because any Steroidal Medicine (say for example, Ibuprofen) will worsen the pain and severity of the condition. It eventually went to me even trying Morphone, and even that wouldn't work. We were completely out of options.

A Veteran my mom New insisted that I try Medical Marijuana, because it worked for his battlefield injury when nothing else seemed to. I was very hesitant at first, WAY more hesitant than you'd expect from a person in extreme pain.after almost 2 weeks of insisting, I finally gave in and tried it. The first few times was extremely difficult to get used to, and I hated the effects (I like being in clear mind), but I eventually learned the dosage properly, and I have been a fully functional adult ever since I started. I used to not be able to walk a quarter of a mile from my dorm to my class, now I walk 1.7 miles both ways to and from school multiple times a week. The anti-inflammatory aspect of the CBD seems to decrease the amount of times I have to go to the restroom, and I don't feel any more pain. I am still taking the long-term medicine my Doctor prescribes (Inflectra/Remicade, and infusion I take every other month), but this has been a godsend. I don't need to worry about my Liver being eviscerated by Tylenol, or the harmful effects of Morphine, this has really let me live my life again.

Perhaps it could be a Placebo, but to go from 7/10 to 0-1/10 seems a bit strong to me, especially considering how Morphine didn't even truly mask the pain. I honestly don't know what I'd be doing with my life right now without the medicine.

[[Feel free to ask any questions or anything you want me to elaborate on further! I was just reading so many posts bashing Marijuana and the study, though the study is rightly being assaulted, so I wanted to hopefully try to show an example of how this has changed a life for the better. Cheers!]]",1

 Já na primeira cena, [Matt ](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/cinema-e-series/2019/01/fas-criam-peticao-e-conseguem-120-mil-assinaturas-para-a-volta-de-demolidor-cancelada.shtml)[Murdock](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/cinema-e-series/2019/01/fas-criam-peticao-e-conseguem-120-mil-assinaturas-para-a-volta-de-demolidor-cancelada.shtml), verdadeira identidade do herói, pergunta a um amigo como os eleitores escolheram o vilão. “Os outros candidatos eram a mesma coisa de sempre. [Fisk ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2016/03/1750003-segunda-temporada-de-demolidor-tera-viloes-incompreendidos.shtml)parecia diferente. Ele lançou uma candidatura independente, sem filiação partidária, não tinha o rabo preso com ninguém”, responde o amigo.

 [  ](https://fotografia.folha.uol.com.br/galerias/nova/1623006435384275-hq-do-demolidor-associacao-vilao-a-bolsonaro#foto-1623006435496173)HQ do Demolidor associação vilão a Bolsonaro A passagem está no volume 17 da HQ do Demolidor que acaba de chegar às bancas, pela editora Panini, e já causou uma polêmica entre fãs. Em um quadro no meio da história, há uma manifestação de partidários. Na versão brasileira, dois deles seguram placas que dizem “Fisk mito” —numa clara referência ao [presidente Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/01/eleitores-de-verde-e-amarelo-deliram-com-uma-brasilia-nostalgica-atras-de-bolsonaro.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/01/eleitores-de-verde-e-amarelo-deliram-com-uma-brasilia-nostalgica-atras-de-bolsonaro.shtml).

 No original em inglês, as placas diziam “Fisk rules”, que poderia ser traduzido como “Fisk governa” ou “comanda”. O assunto tomou os fóruns de quadrinhos nos últimos dias —boa parte elogiava a solução, mas outros afirmavam que o tradutor tentou inserir sua ideologia na história.

 A Panini, em nota, afirmou que o cartaz não faz referência a nenhum político brasileiro. “A editora esclarece que a tradução se apropria do termo ‘mito’ para se referir a alguém que as pessoas admiram, como é o caso do personagem Wilson Fisk.”

 O tradutor da edição, Paulo França, explica melhor sua decisão. Ele diz que traduzir “rules” por “governa” seria pouco natural em português —e que escolheu “mito” pensando na idolatria que os seguidores têm pelo personagem.

 “Temos um paralelo de um político que é idolatrado no Brasil, achei que seria algo próximo do leitor. Apelidaram o sujeito [Bolsonaro] de mito, mas ele não se apropriou da palavra”, afirma.

 “Mas não é uma alusão direta. É uma tradução aberta à interpretação. O pessoal que é eleitor do Bolsonaro está doído achando que é uma comparação com o vilão —mas pensei muito mais na questão da idolatria do que numa associação tão direta [de associá-lo a um vilão]. Comparação direta é algo meio raso.”

 Ainda que com muitas diferenças —o presidente americano não é um mafioso do submundo nova-iorquino como Fisk— a história original faz uma clara associação entre o inimigo do Demolidor e Donald Trump.

 Na [série da ](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/cinema-e-series/2019/01/fas-criam-peticao-e-conseguem-120-mil-assinaturas-para-a-volta-de-demolidor-cancelada.shtml)[Netflix](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/cinema-e-series/2019/01/fas-criam-peticao-e-conseguem-120-mil-assinaturas-para-a-volta-de-demolidor-cancelada.shtml), por exemplo, o Rei do Crime se safa de um processo judicial e ataca a imprensa. Diz que o povo foi manipulado por “fake news” dos jornalistas, que tentaram convencer todos de que ele era um criminoso. Tudo porque ele, Wilson Fisk, “desafia o sistema”.

 É o próprio Fisk quem espalha notícias falsas. Nos quadrinhos, o herói conseguiu junto à Suprema Corte que os super-heróis tivessem legitimidade no sistema legal. Mas o vilão quer criminalizá-los.

 “Impossível não fazer uma associação com a notícias [das ‘fake news’] espalhadas por WhatsApp [pela campanha de Bolsonaro]”, diz França. “Vejo paralelos, mas é a minha visão. Eu não coloquei uma alusão direta a nenhum político do Brasil.”

 Por exemplo, um grupo de policiais é assassinado e o prefeito culpa o Justiceiro. Em dado momento, o [Homem Aranha](https://guia.folha.uol.com.br/cinema/2019/01/novo-longa-do-homem-aranha-e-a-melhor-animacao-de-heroi-ja-lancada.shtml) faz um autorretrato em um prédio acompanhado da frase “Não sou um criminoso”.

 “A cidade está em polvorosa. As pessoas estão irritadas. Elas querem segurança... e Fisk está lhes prometendo isso e mais”, diz um personagem da HQ.

 “Gostei da solução”, diz o tradutor Fábio Bonillo. “Não é preguiçosa. Só o seria se a HQ fosse do começo do século, aí sim seria ridículo forçar uma associação. O tradutor vive e trabalha em um período histórico do qual não dá para fugir.”

 Vale dizer que não há na tradução de Paulo França, contudo, nenhuma associação entre os heróis e o PT.

The reason the provision requires an affidavit along with an FFL is because the state of Illinois doesn't know if your FFL is still valid or not. The Feds don't talk to the state very well. The ATF storage and security standards are a MINIMUM. This magical ATF FFL shouldn't be confused for some gold standard of licensing. 

Plus, there is a separation of powers - in america states get to make laws that affect our rights in the name of safety. If you want to have a rally you need to get a permit and plan for the masses. If you want to pursue your due process right you need to be screened at the door to the courthouse. 

This doesn't infringe on anyone's right to bear arms and is clearly a reasonable expectation of a business selling something that is inherently dangerous. We expect the exact same from a pharmacy.

If you use a 3ml for the 100mg and push it in pretty slow you will deff get a rush for sure, it's not as nice as a dope rush but still very nice.

You can draw the rush out to by pushing it in slowly, I like to count to 30 as I push off and push the 3ml in over that time.

But yeah man you will deff get a rush from the 100mg, just remember that 1ml of water will only hold 60mg of morphine, hence the suggestion to use a 3ml so you can dissolve the 100mg into 1 shot.

The best way is to powder the tablet as fine as possible, like really really fine, then add 3ml of water into a spoon and let it sit for 5 minutes the draw it up through a filter and push it into the back of another 3ml with the micron filter attached, push it through the micron filter into a clean spoon and then pull it up into the 3ml that you will use, push off and enjoy.

Don't add heat, you don't really need to if you are patient as letting it sit for 5 mins will absorb all the goodness anyhow. well, this works with 100mg MsContin tablets anyway. I'm not sure if your pills are the same being from the US not AUS  but they should be fairly similar anyhow.",1

220,2019-01-17 17:41:59+00:00,"I would be interested to know more about these patients; most seemed like they were at end-of-life care.

 It's not uncommon for doctors to prescribe large doses of opiates (1000mcg fentynyl is a lot, yes but for opiate - tolerant patients it can be necessary to adequately control pain) for palliative end of life care. 

Most physicians communicate to family that these drugs are to ease suffering but can decrease respiratory rate and hasten death, but often families would prefer their loved one not be in pain during their final moments.

If these families agreed to end life sustaining practices... Why are they suing? Did he not acquire signed consent forms regarding the risks?

I'd really appreciate input from medical professionals in this discussion because if I were the patient, I would much rather go out this way peacefully and with dignity. ",1

229,2019-01-17 00:33:45+00:00,"I really think the whole narrative about overperscribing leading to an epidemic is quite misleading.

You never hear the full story fron the ""news"" they only scratch the surface and after 10 years they are sometimes calling street ""dope"" fentanyl but still most of the time still heroin.  The news never talks about the chinese labs and how they are constantly tweaking the fentanyl skeleton to come up with different analogs.

Its seems to me that the epidemic is corallated with the continuing emergence of fentalouges from China.  Where before smartphones and the internet so widely available having a source for opiates meant either a script or heroin.  Making heroin from opium is labor intensive and supply is or at least was manipulated by the producers to keep a set price.

The wideapread internet comes and now all you need to do is a little research find a chinese lab and a strong analouge say carfentanil with enough money you could probably have a modest size shipping box contain the morphine equivalent of half the heroin produced by the whole world.  I remember doing the math on it.  IIRC 1g of carfent would be equianalgesic to 5kg of heroin.  So if you got a flat envelope holding 500g of carfent packaged with care you would have the ability to create 2500kg of mannitol and carfent mixture that mimics 100%potency diacetylmorphine.  Now unless you have a proper mixer for this type of thing which I'm sure is outrageously expensive, you are going to end up killing people.  - question- if you were dissolve your carfent and mannitol in water to get even dispertion and then dry it would it be uniformly distributed?  Or does fentany seek to recrystallize together making hot spots of fent?

To be able to deliver on a 2500kg order of real heroin 10 years ago you had to be highly connected with some pretty serious folks.  Due to this new fangled web now any asshole can get fent and sell bags with a profit margin that is astronomical.

Find a few acres and start a poppy field I have a feeling that if you want the time proven morphine and heroin you better start collecting opium so you can turn it to morphine base and smoke that and if you have the right chemicals heroin #3 and #4. 
 Unless you are connected with some legit old timer for real dope or out west as it doesnt seem to be as impacted yet with fent cut tar but ive seem it and it does happen.",1
230,2019-01-16 23:53:18+00:00,"&gt; Even with the first person she mentioned, maybe they were able to make the last few days relatively painless, but there may have been months or weeks leading up to it where they continued to suffer.

Yeah, my dad was one of those Greatest Generation Stoic types, so he never took any pain killing drugs stronger than Tylenol. His last seven months he _knew_ he was going to die soon, but he didn't want to get addicted to morpine, smh.

Up until that point he never complained, but in those last months I'd ask how he was doing and he'd say ""Not so good."" I wasn't able to be with him toward the end, but my mom said breathing was becoming increasingly uncomfortable for him. I remember talking over the phone to my brother-in-law when he was in the hospital, he said ""This morphine drip has changed his life, he's feeling good now, and totally relaxed!"" Um, yeah?

When I got a call at 5 in the morning, I knew what it was about. My mom said his last breath was like a kind of upheaval. He took a deep breath and arched his back, and then relaxed and let it all out. I'm glad he at least had a few days without pain, but also he was the kind of person who felt that pain was just something to bear. I wouldn't call it suffering, I don't think it was that extreme. And I don't think he would have taken assisted suicide, had it been available. But morphine being a respiratory depressant, he might have died in his sleep had he been on it those last few months.

235,2019-01-16 21:15:41+00:00,"""precisas de tirar uma licença"". Escreves tal sem pensar no que tal significa, como se fosse uma coisa normal. Metade das pessoas que fazem queimadas não sabem ler, não sabem preencher um formulário, não tem transporte para ir a uma camara municipal. E um monstro tentacular de repressão acha que isso é normal, que é preciso um papel para fazer uma actividade com milhares e milhares de anos. 

Escreves isso e achas que um pastor que já trabalha 365 dias por ano pode ir de taxi à vila pedir um papel para fazer aquilo que o seu pai, avô e bisavo sempre fizeram. 

Pois, ninguém faz papel e queima, queima ilegalmente, às escondidas e a más horas e em maus dias. Depois morrem.
Pesquisa quantos mortos em ""fogos"" há fora do verão e fica CHOCADO. São DEZENAS.

Sabes como é que a Galiza reduziu a area ardida na década de 90? Deixou-se de ""licenças"", olhou para o passado, de onde veem e quem são. Abrira um numero de telefone regional para ""apoio a queimadas"". O pastor que sempre queimou liga e dizem-lhe ""por favor queime, hoje é um dia perfeito, queime, queime que isso retira combustivel do monte e não arde no verão"". Ou dizem-lhe ""Espere por nós, vamos mandar os sapadores que hoje há um risco de correr mal. Queremos que queime e vamos ajudar"". Não é o velhinho de 90 anos ou o pastor anafalbeto que vai ter com os senhores na vila, é um GRUPO PROFISSIONAL de sapadores que vai o ano todo ter com eles, porque sabem que há milénios que são eles o garante de prevenção, de redução de combustiveis. Que o fogo é uma ferramenta crucial

Em Portugal vive-se acefalamente num ""Portugal sem fogos, depende de todos"". Mandam-se bombeiros e helicopetros em Janeiro apagar queimadas que apenas retiram combustivel. Vai arder no verão e matar pessoas. Manda-se a GNR multar e ameaçar de prisão aquele que mais trabalho, mais mérito e mais louvor tem: aquele que trabalha o monte como há milenios, aquele que retira combustivel. O REAL HEROI, o pastor e o velhinho que resta, mas os bombeiros insistem que são eles os herois.

Sabes porque não se faz em Portugal, ou faz, a AFOCELCA faz ""exactamente o mesmo"" (mas com queimadas iniciadas por eles)? Porque os bombeiros tem muito que fazer, e tem muito dinheiro, todo o dinheiro que o pais pode dedicar aos fogos. Os Bombeiros são o impecilho, o monstro tentacular obra do padre Melicias e marioneta Jaime Marta Soares que não deixam fazer nada, porque ""estão muito ocupados"" a gastar o dinheiro mas não sabem o que é fazer prevenção, nunca a fizeram e mataram a organização que a fazia, a guarda florestal.

São um tentaculo que acredita que é com ""acessos e enxadas"" que se retiram milhões de toneladas por ano do território. Não é, tem custos que levam o pais à falencia todos os anos.
O combustivel está lá porque deixaram de se fazer queimadas, porque o estrume deixou de ser necessario, porque os rebanhos desapareceram. O estrume nunca mais será preciso, há adubo sintético, os rebanhos são trabalho miseravel de 365 dias ao ano não o desejo a ninguem (já fui um deles), resta-nos queimar quando não mata. Queimar que nem tolos, como a Galiza e o Chile, a Austrália e a AFOCELCA, queimar queimar queimar para que não arda com sangue. 

Mas não ""basta uma licença"" dizem eles.

No, not really. Do a cursory google search for “most dangerous drugs” and read up on it.

&gt; My understanding is that you will rapidly build a tolerance and need to constantly increase you dosage in order to achieve the same high. This creates and unsustainable system.

You build up a tolerance to alcohol too. Look, I realize that I’m school they made you sit through DARE or some equivalent but I’m on my phone and I can’t be bothered to educate you seriously on the subject. Do some research, look into it for yourself, stop buying the anti-drug propaganda you’ve been served your whole life.

I don’t say this to be flippant. How much time have you seriously spent considering this topic? I realize this is reddit and CMV isn’t about writing dissertations, you’re just trying to persuade the OP to change their view. But reading through this thread it’s astounding at how little people seem to know about “harder” drugs and how they stack up to alcohol.

Here’s a fun little anecdote for you before I head off home. Back before the prohibition era they would treat alcoholics with *morpheine*, because the reasoning was that a person hooked on opium was better socially than an alcoholic. Food for thought.

Oh also, do some digging (if you’re interested in the topic) into the racist nature of our anti-drug laws. Ask yourself why San Francisco was the first city to ban opium dens.

&gt;The Netherlands has a great model here. They are decommissioning prisons because they have no criminals to fill them. They treat addition as a health problem. But they also don't allow albert heijn to sell drugs, and they don't allow anyone to sell hard drugs.

I agree. I prefer decriminalization to prohibition but I don’t understand why people want to continue fighting an ever escalating, bloody, and failing war on drugs. We could better spend that money on treatment and save countless lives.",1

 Quase desconhecido no início da campanha, o ex-juiz Wilson Witzel (PSC) passou de coadjuvante a governador do [Rio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/riodejaneiro/). Ele surpreendeu com uma forte arrancada nos dias anteriores ao primeiro turno.

 No início do governo, Witzel continua surpreendendo —desta vez com declarações e tradicionalismos inusitados.

 O governador do Rio de Janeiro, Wilson Witzel, se reúne com o secretariado - Carlos Magno - 12.jan.19/Secom [Na posse](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/01/witzel-toma-posse-no-rio-e-promete-apoio-a-bolsonaro-e-ataque-a-narcoterroristas.shtml), agarrou-se a uma faixa de governador que mandou confeccionar especialmente para a ocasião.

 Não retirou o adereço, que não é praxe neste tipo de cerimônia, nem quando reuniu-se com o secretariado.

 Naquela manhã, Witzel chegou à Assembleia em um Chrysler Town &amp; Country preto. Segundo sua assessoria, o carro blindado foi alugado pelo partido e já era utilizado desde a transição.

 Quando empossou o secretário de Polícia Militar, Rogério Figueiredo, o governador também vestiu uma faixa, honraria da corporação.

 Dias depois, Witzel participou de uma cerimônia mais descontraída. Na última terça (8), o ex-jogador Ronaldinho Gaúcho colocou o pé na calçada da fama do Maracanã e no joelho do governador, que fingiu engraxar sua chuteira para uma foto.

 Em dezembro, [Ronaldinho entregou seu passaporte](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/01/com-passaporte-apreendido-ronaldinho-e-chamado-de-heroi-por-governador-do-rio.shtml) ao Tribunal de Justiça do Rio Grande do Sul, em função de uma dívida com a Justiça gaúcha que já ultrapassou R$ 8 milhões. Foi condenado por dano ambiental e ainda não cumpriu a decisão.

 O imbróglio não pareceu incomodar Witzel, que disse que o ex-jogador é um “parceiro do povo do Rio”.

 Outras declarações, mais duras, continuam causando polêmica. Na posse do secretário da Polícia Civil, Marcus Vinícius Braga, o governador afirmou que o [estado precisa da sua própria Guantánamo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/01/rio-de-janeiro-precisa-ter-a-sua-gantanamo-para-traficantes-diz-witzel.shtml) para traficantes. Ele se referia à prisão americana em Cuba que abriga acusados de terrorismo.

 A fala vai ao encontro das demais soluções para a segurança pública apresentadas por Witzel. O governador já prometeu que atiradores de elite irão “abater” criminosos que portarem armas pesadas.

 Posicionamentos linha-dura para combater a criminalidade fizeram parte da estratégia de Witzel, que se apresentou ao eleitor como o candidato mais semelhante a Jair Bolsonaro.

 Ainda que tenha surfado na onda bolsonarista, Witzel surpreendeu outra vez ao firmar uma espécie de pacto de não agressão com o presidente da Alerj, André Ceciliano (PT), que tenta permanecer na cadeira.

 Com poucas chances de vitória na corrida para a presidência da Casa, Márcio Pacheco (PSC), escolhido líder do governo na Alerj, abriu mão da candidatura. Apesar das divergências, ele decidiu apoiar Ceciliano para dar governabilidade a Witzel.

 O governador não tem falado sobre o assunto, mas já fez elogios a Ceciliano e ao seu trabalho na Assembleia.

There's no policy that could ever hope to completely eliminate illicit drug deals. But legalization and regulation is our best option. Look at what happened during Prohibition, banning alcohol gave rise to bootleggers and large criminal organizations, such as the one Al Capone led. After the repeal of Prohibition,  illegal bootlegging was no longer profitable and organized crime dropped off sharply.

&gt; If Mexico's government wasn't so corrupt...

Gee, wouldn't that be great if we could just say, ""Hey Mexican government, can you stop being corrupt, please?""

Unfortunately, that hasn't worked so far. What will work though, is undermining the cartels, whose money *enables* corruption.

&gt; Streamlining the citizenship/asylum process will bring more in and we will have way too many that we can assimilate into your country.

Ah, at last the truth comes out. ""I don't like immigrants because they're different and that scares me."" At least you're being honest now.

&gt; We don’t have the resources to allow anyone and everyone in - we have our own citizens to worry about.

We actually do. Immigrants contribute billions to the economy every year. They work, they open businesses, they enrich our culture, they commit crimes at lower rates than non-immigrants, and as citizens they would pay taxes. Not only do we have enough resources for them, they're actually a net benefit to our society.

&gt; Most drug smugglers are coming to points of entry?? You’ve got to be joking.

I'm not joking. Page 2, paragraph 2 of this 2015 DEA [report](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44599.pdf) says the most Mexican criminal organizations move their illegal goods, in vehicles, through ports of entry.

Also, The Center for Migration Studies, a non-partisan think-tank, released a [report](http://cmsny.org/publications/jmhs-visa-overstays-border-wall/) that shows that the majority of illegal immigrants from Mexico came here *legally*, with a visa, and then just overstayed their Visa.

&gt; Spending billions on a wall is actually a pretty smart thing if it deters illegals from attempting to cross...

Beefing up security in places where people *aren't* generally trying to cross isn't going to deter them. They'll just keep smuggling drugs the same ways they always have, and innovating new ones like [drones](https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/20/mexican-drug-cartels-using-drones-to-smuggle-heroi/), which can fly over walls if you didn't know.

While I’m not an incel, I’ve had girlfriends and been with a handful of women, I do have an incredibly hard time in the dating scene.  For example it’s been two years right now since I’ve been with anyone for anything.  I grew up in a pretty shitty home life, my bad was really abusive and would call me a piece of shit and fuck up on a daily basis starting at about 8, and get physical every other week or so.  My moms new boyfriend was even worse, and my mom got into a bad car wreck which gave her really bad brain damage when I was five, and so we never have been able to really connect, and I cut my dad out of my life at 14.  I developed social anxiety to the point where I was basically confined to my room for several years from about 16 to 19, and I started using drugs to cope at 14 which quickly escalated to opiates, oxy, heroin, and fetanyl.  Ten years of my life were spent being constantly borderline suicidal and feeling completely unable to connect with anyone.  I did make some friends, and had a girlfriend for 3 years, but it was incredibly dysfunctional as I was a complete disaster.  Fast forward now I’ve been clean for about 18 months, and am slowly getting better.  The depression has finally gotten to a manageable level over these past six months where I don’t feel a constant sense of despair everyday.  I was recently diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder however, which is characterized by extreme social anxiety and fear of connecting with others and any sort of intimacy.  Anyways, things are the best they’ve been the past ten years right now, but I’m far from being out of the woods yet, maybe I never will be, we’ll see.  Anyways I’m not writing this looking for any ones sympathy or a pity party, it just goes to show that you never know why people are the way they are, and in the case of incels that stuff doesn’t happen in a vacuum, there is definitely some sort of trauma or mental health problem that is happening when people are unable to connect.

If you are using the clinic correctly it can be very helpful. Correctly being, as a tool and going to therapy and not using other drugs. I have 3 yrs clean from heroin, crack, Xanax and my journey started with methadone. I would encourage her to stay on the clinic bc methadone withdrawal is hard and an unstable person will probably end up doing heroin to deal with the pain. I had to wean off after some years and it took a long time. At one point I was actually going to the clinic for 2mg down from 140 mg. 

I tried getting sober so many times I can’t count. My kids couldn’t keep me sober, my job, being homeless, the courts, nothing. Finally I was 29 about to be 30 and shooting 6 grams of heroin a day, on 140mg of methadone, smoking crack, and exiting Xanax like candy and for the grace of god I don’t know how in the hell this happened but I met and unbelievable man. I knew he wouldn’t be with me strung out, so I stopped. We now have a baby and I have my other kids back full time. 

I know in Massachusetts’s we have a section 35 where a family member can pentition the court to have a family member put in treatment for 28-90 days. In Florida it’s called a baker act and California has something similar. Being a drug addict is a danger to herself or others and is reason for courts to take action. It’s been done to me. A warrant will be issued and the person will be forced to complete treatment. I know forced treatment isn’t the most successful form, but for some, something clicks. Maybe your sis needs to lose her child as harsh as that sounds. Enabling is the WORST thing you can do. At one point my dad was taking me to get heroin and coke every day bc he was afraid I was going to disappear one day (I had a habit of just disappearing for weeks on end). He was addicted to my addiction. 

I know you want to see your sister do well but it’s possible she hasn’t experienced enough pain, a bottom so to speak. My mentor used to tell me an addicts bottom had trap doors, meaning we can always go lower. 

So many people are dying from the disease of addiction, especially with the fetanyl they is around. My FB feed has become an obituary. I hope and pray your sister gets help before she isn’t able to anymore, at least for her child’s sake.

Long story short, its used for pain management and addiction management.


It can be abused though and, for me, personally i used it as a crutch during withdrawals till i could get my actual opiates. People do take the suboxone as thier drug of choice because it does give a Euphoric feeling.


While Saboxone can't be injected with a needle because of the Naloxone some brands of Buprenorphine do not add that to thier chemistry leading to potential IV abuse of the drug.


Opiates man, scurge of the country right now. I'm lucky to have survived through it, very easy to see the decline and how it became an epidemic. In my area circa 2007 till about 2012 all of the junkies were abusing perscriptions opiates. In 2010 Purdue Pharma changed the chemistry of OxyContin making it difficult to abuse, OxyContin as a brand was your defacto pharma opiate to abuse, since this wasn't the case as of 2010 you were left will typically Percocets. These were much more scarce as the scripts for OcyContin were still being prescribed but not put on that black market due to how hard it was to abuse. Scarcity and price of perscriptions made people, me included, seek heroin. I know a lot of people who also turned too dermal patches of fentanyl, me included. As a short interlude till i found out how cheep and how far heroin would get you.


 Very lucky to be alive, if i got my hands on some patches I would typically smoke 100 micrograms over a 12 hour binge. To give you an idea of severity to addiction, thatd net me maybe 25 inhales. That would 100% kill anyone each inhale that didnt have a dependence, so if i grabbed 25 random people and made them hit it, id have a kill streak of 25.


5 years high of my life were spent doing enough oxys to send an ox to rehab and 3 years deep into a heroin and fentanyl patch addiction. Had 1 overdose that i was lucky enough now to wake up from as it happened alone while in my room. Oddly enough it happened early in my years while on pills.

&gt;While the study counts the cost of benefits such as Medicaid and English-language programs used by the citizen children of unauthorized immigrants, they do not include the taxes those citizens pay once they become adults and move out of their parents' household.

&gt;A National Academies of Sciences report published in September 2016 found that while immigrants — especially ones with lower education levels like most undocumented immigrants — are probably a net fiscal drain, the children of all immigrants are among the highest economic contributors and taxpayers in the country. 

&gt;""If you throw out the impact of the kids, you are also sort of stacking the deck for your preferred outcome,"" said Gretchen Donehower a researcher from the University of California, Berkeley, and a consultant on the National Academies of Sciences report.

&gt;The libertarian Cato Institute, an organization which favors more open immigration policy, is critical of the FAIR estimate because it doesn't look at the total effect of immigrants on the economy.

377,2019-01-09 19:22:45+00:00,"I think when someone talks about ""privilege"" they're talking about how someone is treated due to their skin color. At least that's the way I look at it. 

These things don't bother me since most of the people that I'll encounter out in the wild I'll most likely never run across again. So when I'm treated differently due to me being black (which honestly either doesn't happen very often any longer or I simply don't notice or care enough for it to register). But I can tell you stories of how I was treated differently for what I can only assume was the color of my skin. And I am very aware that it happens. The quick dirty list are: stores and restaurants. In most cases if I and a caucasion person was dressed in the same casual attire I could receive worse service. In the case of a store I, out of the two of us, would be most likely to be followed or monitored by employees / security. 
I can remember times when I've walked into a store just to pass time or to see if they had anything interesting to buy only to rushed at the door by someone asking what I was looking for. This wasn't an over eager sales person but an actual attempt to discourage me from walking around the store (yes, you can feel when this is happening). I've had verying degrees of poor service, from normally service oriented restaurants, over time. Two fo the worse incidents being at a Joe's Crab Shack where my (now) wife and I were simply forgotten about for almost 45 mintes. Yes, we were seated, they took our order, and 45 minutes later someone there noticed that we were sitting around and when they asked if they could help us and we responed that we were waiting for our food they realized that not only was the food not ready but the order wasn't even entered. The second at the top of the list was breakfast at a Denny's while on vacation where the waitress simply didn't bother to check up on us during the meal. Once we received our bill we paid at the register. I left to load up the toddler and my wife's friend came out to tell me that the manager was refusing to let me wife leave as she'd accused her of attempting to dine and dash. I may have been able to overlook this if all of us wasn't at the register minutes earlier where that same manager took our payment. As it turns out someone run up the wrong bill so the credit went to another table vs ours. I may still be able to overlook this if anyone at the restaurant would have offered a simple apology once this was realized. 

I can't help but to feel that perhaps the staff would have felt like they would have shown that they gave a crap if I wasn't black. 

I can go into other things such as medical care. I can compare the care that I receive (especially when it comes to comfort) of myself vs my wife (who is Asian). One night I found myself at the emergency room due to what turned out to be peritonitis. peritonitis a very painful medical condition. In the end I was sent home, told to contact my primary doctor, and when I asked for something to help me cope with the pain I was told asprine should take care of it. 
To contrast that with a visit to the emergency room recently for the wife for what turned out to be a kidney stone. She was immediatly given morpine to take care of the pain while they diagnosed what the issue was. She was then sent home with a prescription to take care of the pain as well any possiblility of any nausia that she may experience. 

For myself there are ways around the poor treatment. I only shop at stores where I'm treated as any other customer would be treated. I vacation where every paying tourist is treated the same. The vast majority of my shopping for items are done online or using in-store pickup. And I normally cook my own meals negating the need to eat out (and saving money as a bonus). 

I'm sorry for what you're going through (I can empathise as I have my own medical issues). But nothing you mentioned will cause people to: follow you around a store, clutch their purse closer to themselves, assume that you don't have the money to pay for an item or service, assume that you're not intelligent enough to comprehend a topic, that you're only asking for pain medication in order to abuse or sell said medication, etc. ",1

So at least I've got a good idea of how sick I need to be.  Just nervous about messing it up again.  Pretty sure I'll get it right.  How long do you think I'll need to take the subs for?  How long  will it take the fentnyl to work out of my system?  I've got 5 subs I was going to take them over about a weeks time, weaning down.  Then after that prob nothing. What do you think? ",1

386,2019-01-09 02:45:21+00:00,"Physician here, wanted to clarify. I think people are confusing the drugs themselves with the level of sedation intended. Propofol, Versed, Ketamine, Fentayl are all commonly used drugs for anesthesia and while they all have varying mechanisms of action, your end goal is still sedation. It’s the dose that defines what level of sedation you’re shooting for. I’ll routinely give patients propofol and fentanyl for a reduction, and GI’s will often give fentanyl/versed for endoscopies/colonoscopies but we wouldn’t call that general anesthesia, rather we’re achieving only procedural/conscious sedation. But if I intubate someone, you bet I’m going to give them a big dose of fentanyl/propofol so they don’t wake up or have any pain. 

Ketamine is one of those drugs that’s getting increasingly popular, especially since it induces sedation and analgesia as a dissociative anesthetic. Psychiatrists are experimenting with using it to treat depression for example. That’s the so called “vitamin K” some people talk about. ",1

409,2019-01-08 16:05:25+00:00,"It's a lot like quitting smoking. Love/affection serve, in some ways, as an addiction - that mental cocktail of oxycotin and other excited endorphins were giving you a ""happiness high"" that you're now going through withdraw from, because the stimulation that caused it is now gone and your brain chemistry is out of whack because of it.

Because of this, there's no 100% method to speed up the process of recovery -- it takes a few weeks/months/years to recalibrate, and in the mean time, what you are experiencing is a form of chemical depression. It does *help*, however, to remove all the triggers/stimulations that you associate with the person you've lost, so that you feel fewer pangs in the mean time.

Block them on facebook, delete their number, don't try to stalk them on social media (if you can.) It's extremely hard to move on if you are keeping up to date on what they're doing without you. Associate with old friends, try to focus on doing the little things you *couldn't* do when you were in the relationship. Develop new habits or hobbies (I literally took up amateur taxidermy to get my mind off a 8-year LTR break-up. It was messy, smelly, time-consuming and a perfect distraction.)

410,2019-01-08 16:00:04+00:00,"It’s kind of a tie so I’ll tell both.

01: When I was pregnant with my first baby, I had to have a c-section. Three years later, I got pregnant with my son and wanted a VBAC (because my surgery sucked to recover from, I don’t have anything against c-sections). I was a good candidate so we just waited and waited and waited but I was a week overdue and the kid just wasn’t coming.

Now, when you have a c-section one time, it doesn’t mean you can’t have a vaginal birth later, but it does mean that you can’t have a chemical induction. Basically, I could have pitocin, but I couldn’t have cytotech or anything to make my cervix soften up and open. Those types of drugs can also soften the scar from your prior surgery and it increases the risk of uterine rupture.

So, if you want a VBAC and you need to be induced, they have to do it mechanically. For a lot of women, they are starting to dilate so some pitocin and breaking the waters gets things moving. Not me, I was just starting to pass a few bits and pieces of my mucus plug but I was at “fingertip” dilation, which basically means “haha fuckall.”

That means we have to get the cervix to open up. No drugs, so mechanically. This means they stick a balloon in your uterus between your cervix and the baby’s head, and then fill it up with water. A long tube hangs out of you and they tape that to your leg so that you are giving gentle tension, pulling down. They did this to me, and then started giving me a shit ton of pitocin to start me having contractions.

Thirty. Fucking. Hours. Of that agony. I was 100% for pain management too, but the gas and air didn’t work for these contractions, it just made me nauseous, but when we upped the ante to fentynyl, it would stall my labor. It was too early for an epidural, so nothing could be done. I would sit for 2-5 minutes, then the contraction would come and I’d feel the urge to stand up and bend over a pile of pillows on the bed while my husband rubbed my back. 

I cried, I made cow sounds, I breathed. Every now and then I’d need the toilet, but whenever I say on the toilet, I would have a massive agonizing contraction. I almost just wanted to piss myself instead of sitting down on the toilet like that. As you get closer to giving birth, your body knows and wants to give you as much room as possible, so you get a sudden urge to shit out everything in your entire body. I sat down, had that horrible toilet sitting contraction at the same time as terrible diarrhea stomach cramps. I couldn’t reach around to wipe myself, I remember crying and calling for my husband to help me, saying “nobody can do this, nobody can. It’s not possible, how could anyone do this? I’m going to die.”

When the balloon finally came out, I went into active labor, but it was like a sunny vacation in the Bahamas. I was so happy that the balloon was gone, I’d have had those contractions for the rest of my life with no complaint. They pulled it out, broke my water, and let me get in the bathtub and wash myself. Plus, I could finally have my epidural - which was one of the top ten experiences of my entire life. 

Anyway, after 42 hours of labor, I ended up with another c-section (my son had a short cord around his neck twice, which explained why he stubbornly resisted being born) but I will never forget that horrific balloon.

413,2019-01-08 14:37:33+00:00,"1. Dealers using fetanyl is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for a drug overdose fatality.

2. Even if that were the case, the causal chain still runs through the abrogation of personal responsibility on the part of the addict. One of the reasons the drug war still recieves widespread electoral support is the idea that drug addicts are somehow ""victims"" of a shady underworld of bad people, none of whom are at all related to the person having this thought, who are *really* responsible for the malaise that surrounds drug use. So drugs are illegal, people who sell drugs are prosecuted, and as a result, they have to take action to ensure that their commerce is clandestine, which means higher potency during distribution for dilution at the street level. Fentanyl abuse is a direct result of the prosecution of drug dealers, enabled by the social abrogation of personal responsibility by the families and communities that failed in their duty to provide an environment in which people don't want to go off and do heroin in the first place.

414,2019-01-08 14:35:55+00:00,I had an inflamed gall bladder with gall stones backing up into the common bile duct. I spent a night on the bathroom floor throwing up and wishing I was dead. It felt like I was being stabbed with a knife just below my rib cage. Eventually I went to the ER and they did an ultrasound and were pressing right where the pain was the worst. 15 minutes after the ultrasound a nurse came in and started an IV. I asked what she was giving me. “Morpheine.” I asked why I was getting morpheine. “The doctor will be in to explain in a few minutes.” That’s when I started to freak out a little. ,1

I had my appendix removed at around 21, the pain was reasonably bad. It didn't burst but it was a good deal of pain but I could at least get some small relief trying different ways to lie or put pressure on it etc. Went to hospital, had it removed, all better.

&amp;#x200B;

Gall bladder though. Holy hell. I had no idea what was wrong with me, I was convinced it was kidney related. I was vomiting hard enough to burst the blood vessels surrounding my eyes (I looked like a bloody panda) in desperation to get whatever was hurting me out of me. Didn't work. Went to hospital, they gave me some stuff, told me to keep and eye on it. I went home, the pain lessened and I had a couple of weeks feeling normal then BAM, same pain, up at 3am, in agony for like 2 hours before going back to hospital. NOTHING could relieve the pain.

I was in A&amp;E rolling around on the floor in agony. Actually rolling on the floor squashing my face into the earth hoping it would swallow me.

They gave me some codeine, I didn't feel it at all. I went on another hour or so before I could get morphene and ohhhh was it sweet. The nurse injected it and I was lifted to the sky. Amazing, yet I was still aware of the throbbing pain that I could just about still feel. Within about 5 minutes or so the pain was coming back faster and faster and I was beginning to suspect that I wasn't going to be allowed another hit for a couple hours or so.

It was hell, and after a day of it I took a suppository which dulled the pain and knocked me clean out and slept until morning when I got an ultrasound done and discovered gall stones.

The pain was bad enough but it was basically just normal gastro. However due to me having time off school my doctor got a little too invested into finding out what was wrong with me. Had to go through scan after scan, blood test after blood test. It was like I had been abducted by aliens. 

If anyone here has dealt with stomach pain and doctors, you probably know that 90% of the time they will never find what’s wrong and prescribe you with a bunch of random shit that does nothing but make problems worse. After finding nothing wrong with me, he decided it would be an awesome idea to prescribe me with some of the most powerful anti biotics you could give a 15 year old. Not sure what they were called, or if they were antibiotics at all but i’m pretty sure they were. 

I took the antibiotics for about roughly a week and a half every night before I went to bed. As I was taking them my stomach pain progressively got worse and worse until one morning my stomach snapped and I woke up in so much fucking pain I couldn’t think straight. You know that pain you get when you eat taco bell and you shit your guts out the next morning. Yeah well it was like that but x1000. I was in a catatonic state of pain and ended up running around in circles screaming in my front yard. In fact I was in so much pain that I was hallucinating that garden gnomes were talking to me and my dog was shouting at me. I’ve never been disembowelled but i’m gonna take a wild guess and assume the pain was that bad. My mother was yelling at me to get into the car and none of the words she was saying made sense. 

Mom rushed me to the hospital and I was taken into the emergency ward and dosed with morpheine. After spending all day in hospital, the head doctor came into my room and told me how lucky I was that I rushed to hospital. Turns out that the antibiotics I was taking, combined with their strength, were being rejected by my body. This ultimately triggered my nervous system into  attacking my stomach.  I’ve been burned, stabbed by rebar, fallen off a roof and broken my neck. Nothing can hold a light to the pain I was in that day.

There was a a rope of stretchy eslastic (the kind used in kids trampolines, like - https://www.picclickimg.com/d/w1600/pict/192656910924_/Dunlop-Childrens-Kids-Mini-Trampoline-new-bungee.jpg) that had metal hooks at either end (to hold it to the frame). My friend attached one end to a lamppost on the street, and I tied the other around my waist before running back and forth to use the elastic to help run faster in the other direction. 

I made an offhand comment about it getting tighter, and so my friend thinks I'm in pain, so goes to undo the cord wrapped around the lamppost. As I've pulled the other end of the cord tight. The metal hook rockets through the air. Bam. Pow. Right in the kisser. 

I can't really remember the pain, but I know it hurt. A lot. Also, sorry mum! I'm sure you didn't need to see your child coming home, cluthing their mouth, blood pouring from between their fingers.

The pain I do remember though is from the dentist - had to get a root canal done. The anasthetic wore off partway through the treatment. That was a bitch.

I've also broken an arm when I was very young (fell off a couch). I don't remember that anywhere near as much, but I know I had to stay in the hospital, and was given morphene. I've heard that I looked bad enough that my dad's colour pretty much drained from his face. ",1

But I was the only one who knew I wasn't willingly walking or riding our of there.they tried to move me to the shade and I screamed in pain. They then moved me to the shade each time the shade moved because they argued with me for four hours. This whole time I'd been staring at the ground with my forehead on the grass.

They lifted my collar on my shirt and told me I had just bruised my shoulder. But eventually I begged one of them to go to a nearby house and get help. It took him half an hr to return (the house wasn't that far) and he came back with a ten year old kid and an arm sling. I screamed at the kid who ran home and told his mum to call an ambulance. Another half hour later the 4x4 ambulance made the drive through the field to find me. Gave me a green whistle and some morphiene and began to cut my shirt off. Turns out the bruise went from my shoulder up past my ear and down to my thigh. So the shorts went too. Finally pain relief after five hours. But that wasn't the worst pain.

I was off my head on morphiene for the x-ray and don't remember that bit. But when I came too I was sat upright on a hospital bed in my underwear and a nurse was kneeling on the bed behind my.

The pain drained the last of the morphien from my system and it all hit me at once. At some point a doctor had told one of the nurses that I would need an upper back brace. He probably meant either later on...or while I was medicated.

The brace was a foam loop around each shoulder vertically. With three material straps with belt buckles to pull them tight ..and she couldn't get it tight enough in her books.

The problem was I had snapped my collar bone in two...long ways. Two big thin pointy slivers and they'd rotated so their joins were now the outsides. There was also several small chunks of bone just doing their own thing. So every time she yanked on the straps it shifted that whole bag of trouble around.

My stepdad ended up shoving her off me and I collapsed and blacked out.

Months and months of recovery and permanent bad posture and fucking nightmares from that moment.",1
426,2019-01-08 05:09:52+00:00,"I'm a long term (20 yrs) chronic pain patient due to multiple spinal issues. I've been through almost all of the IR and ER meds, as well as trying different combinations. I find that most drs. believe in utilizing both and in my experience almost all of the ER meds do not last as long as they are supposed to (but that may be my metabolism) so having breakthough meds just makes sense. 

  I went from just Norco to adding MSContin, which I HATED, due to some side effects that seriously affected my quality of life. It made me feel fuzzy and dopey and completely devoid of motivation and energy. In addition to that,  I found it to be the worst of all the opiates in regards to constipation and nausea. 

  After a few years of that I was switched to the Duragesic and stayed on it for about 6 years. It worked well, except for the dose dumping issues and unreliable coverage, which ended up in an increase in dosage from 25mcg/ 72 hrs to 50 mcg and having to start changing my patch every 48 hrs. My tolerance increased and I still had breakthough pain, especially when I would end up getting a shitty brand of generic from the pharmacy. I finally resorted to having them special order the Sandoz brand for me. A good brand of generic and a supply of Tegaderm is a must for anyone on fentanyl patches!! Eventually, the Dr. decided that it was time to decrease my fentanyl patches to 25mcg every 72 hrs., but change my breakthrough med to something stronger.  Unfortunately, that something was Opana. That med eventually almost ruined my life. I had never misused my meds (snorting, injecting, etc). I had managed to take them the right way from the time I was 18 till I was 34. I took my first opana and nothing happened. I kept taking them orally for days and I was absolutely miserable.  It felt like I had just taken a tylenol and I was in agonizing pain and having terrible withdrawal symptoms. So, Google led me to the fact that oxymorphone only has about a 10% bioavailability when taken orally, and a 40-60% bioavailability when taken intranasally. Sadly, at that point I was desperate enough to cross that line and as soon as I tried it, there was no turning back. For the first time in 15 years, I was pain free. I thought it was a blessing but I was so very wrong. When you've been through a lifetime of constant pain and you've been trying to be happy and functional with a pain level of 6, even with meds, having no pain at all is very addictive and turns out to be impossible to maintain.  I know that Opana isnt one of the options that you mentioned, but if it does turn out to be one that you are offered in the future or come to find is covered by your insurance.... beware. Its not effective orally and way too effective when snorted. I thought I had my life back and felt so relieved to feel human again and be able to do all the things with my kids that my pain had prevented me from for so long. It doesn't stay that way for more than a few months because most people's tolerance increases significantly faster with opana than with other meds.

  I hope you don't mind me telling you all this  in my attempt to possibly prevent you or anybody else who might read this, from accidentally falling into the same hellish fate that I suffered for 6 years. Everybody's body reacts differently to meds, but Ive heard many horror stories just like mine with the Opana. 

 Im sorry that you've suffered such pain for so long and that you're facing a med change that you are going into without knowing what choice will work for you. Its always a scary proposition when you have to make a decision that is going to affect your daily life and you might be stuck with that med for a month till you see the dr. 

  You know your body best, but if you've taken oxycodone in any form and it worked well for you and you didn't have any side effects.... I think your safest bet would be the  Xtampza ER. If your dr. approves of you staying on a breakthrough med, I would NOT turn that down becauase you need to be prepared for a rough adjustment period, when going from Duragesic to another ER med. If you are able to keep some of your meds on hand for the adjustment period, in case of emergency, I definitely would! The new med will work *at the right dose*, but who knows what dose the dr will start you at. 

It would be a good idea to go to the official website for Xtampza (or whichever med you choose) and use their conversion calculator and then have that information ready, in case you find that the dr. is giving you a dose of the new med that will be significantly less than the equivalent of 50mcg of Duragesic. That way, if you need to plead your case for a stronger dose, you have clinical proof that came directly from the manufacturers of the medicine he is prescribing. Drs. hate patients looking to ""Dr. Google "", but having proof of legitimate clinical recommendations about the appropriate dose, from the most valid source possible, will be hard for him to dismiss.

 So sorry for the super long post, but I really felt for you and wanted to help in anyway I could.  Hope it all works out okay and if you have any questions about any of the other meds (I didnt want to list every single ER and IR med I tried) or anything else, Im glad to help. I dont know everything about these meds, just my own experience and research, which Im glad to share if it will help anyone. Please let us know how it all turns out and Ill be sending good vibes and prayers for you.",1

Yes, but how would pharmaceutical heroin be any more dangerous than pharmaceutical OxyContin? It could be supplied in pill form just like OxyContin is.  If what I am advocating was actually implemented and USP grade heroin was available, likely OcyContin would present even more of a problem.

Din cunostintele mele  în Romania conform legii  [nr. 339 din 29 noiembrie 2005](http://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocumentAfis/66456)   Cap III art 12 este legal în scop medicinal DAR compusul THC din plantă este încadrat în tabelul I din anexă la substanțe interzise, doar ca la noi nu a cerut nimeni din cate stiu eu licenta de cultivare si distributie a acestei planete, sau vreun doctor care sa dea reteta pentru cannabis. In Grecia pana acum s-au investit 3 mld $ din partea canadienilor plus ceva din partea Israelului care sunt si cei mai mari jucatori pe piata mondiala iar ministrul de finante a [declarat](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-medicine-cannabis/greece-eyes-pot-of-gold-as-medicinal-cannabis-licensed-idUSKCN1NO1ZY) ca Grecia este deschisa pentru investitii in acest domeniu, tinand cont ca in Grecia consumul medicinal era interzis acum un an consider ca banii investitorilor joaca un rol foarte important despre cum si cand aceasta buruiana v-a ajunge si la noi sa fie fumata legal. In Romania au aparut doar doua fonduri de investitii care au vorbit despre asta dar daca cauti un pic despre ele  realizezi ca nu sunt ceva serios dar este un inceput.

Din pacate din cauza celor care nu au dorinta de a afla mai mult despre ce inseamna si ce va insemna bussiness-ul numit cannabis pe plan mondial si care doar spun ce aud de la tv sau nu considera aceasta idee ca fiind una semnificativa spunand ca nu este un lucru despre care merita sa vorbim ii afecteaza atat pe oamenii care chiar isi doresc sa nu mai fie considerati infractori sau sa se expuna la atatea riscuri pentru un drept uman, dar si economia tarii pentru ca iarba va fi legala indiferent daca ne place sau nu, doar ca Romania pierde startul, acum se impart feliile, ce tari vor importa cannabis si ce tari vor exporta cannabis, vom fi si producatori sau doar consumatori, potentialul pentru Romania ca si producator este urias dar banii nu vin in ape tulburi si nesigure.

I am not convinced realism is always equal cynicism.

Say a person began helping pay household bills at 15, but had no support from parents in regards to parenting (e.g. teaching economic responsibility) or even assistance with meals or chores at home. When a child's week with school and work is ~80% ""adulting"" whereas their parent had a work week that only consisted of smoking tobacco, drinking diet coke, and popping percacets. Now lets say this child manages to get into university against the odds, this person is already tired. Without any assistance and immense stress most of their peers never feel or will never know. This person hears their peers explain how parents paid for tuition and bought them a car.. Fast forward this person ""failed"" at univeristy, mostly because even with a meal plan they were starving every day. The shambles of a family that was has fallen apart even more because their sister's have all married and ""changed families"" ..... This kid never had a fucking dollar to save. Never knew a tooth fairy dollar: never knew what a birthday could mean to themselves. And so they finally come to terms with their socio-economic status, they realised and did the math: that they'd be able to start saving for a home at around 35 years of age. But that was before the price increases. Not to mention women don't give me the time of day because I am a ""renter"". So buy a car to get a farther ""better"" higher paying job which just pushes the prospect back more....

Sure, it IS my fault I will never be able to afford a home for myself.. It is my fault I am alone. But I ain't negative in day to day interactions, I am just a realist.

I fully expect to get hate for sharing my story but i feel like I need to. I found out I was pregnant with my youngest of my two daughters my first day at a methadone clinic. I was married to an abusive, heroin and crack addicted narcopath (psychopath or sociopath with narcissistic personality disorder), I had become a heroin addict because I had a doctor who I trusted 100% who prescribed me opiate painkillers for a variety of valid reasons for years (including ongoing pain from fracturing my hip during delivery with my first daughter that didn’t heal correctly and causes me daily pain that varies in intensity from mild to excruciating depending on the day, what position I slept in, if it’s raining or not, etc)(without making me aware just how easy it is to become physically dependent on opiate pain killers and until my marriage I didn’t have any experience with addiction) well when the government started to crack down hard on doctors prescribing these pain killers, he cut me off without warning or explanation just saying he was cutting all non cancer patients off because of the risk to him and his practice. All of the sudden there I was sicker than I’ve ever been In my entire life and up until that point I had no idea I was addicted, no idea I was physically dependent and I had a toddler daughter who depended on me. I couldn’t be vomiting and shitting and sweating with restless legs, unable to eat, with zero energy, unable to get out of bed, that wasn’t an option. My husband at the time couldn’t care for her alone as he was struggling as well. I’d always looked st him as the addict and me and the stable one trying to save him. I was living in an apartment building and had a neighbor who sold his methadone so he could get crack. He helped me out with some that day so I could function. I started getting it from him until one day he didn’t have any, I was the sickest I’ve ever physically and I felt like I was actually dying. I was terrified and my daughter needed me. My husband at the time was abusive and controlling and had isolated me from all of the friends I had had before our relationship (and none of them had become mothers yet, I had my daughter at 22 on purpose as all I ever wanted to be was a mother, I was completely sober when I had her and didn’t know that my husband at the time (now ex thank god) was an addict or a narcopath, at the time I just thought he was the man of my dreams) anyway I had absolutely ZERO support system, I had no one to turn to, no one who could watch my daughter Sofia while I detoxed or went to rehab. I felt like I had no choice but to figure something out. I look at my then husband and I said what can I do, how do I feel better? Sofia needs dinner and I’ll have to clean the house and potty train her and I can’t even get out of bed. 
He looked at me and said he needed $40 and he’d be back in 45 minutes. At that moment, as sick as I was, I would’ve sold you my grandmother to feel better. So I did exactly what he said. 
When he got back I told him I would never 1. Let my daughter see me use and 2. Learn to shoot up. And I never broke either of those. He did it for me every time. The only things i ever give him credit for is that he never let me learn to shoot up, he never pushed me to use in front of our daughter (though I found out after leaving him that he had done it in front of her when she got a toy doctor set with a syringe and showed me what daddy did... broke my heart.) and he always always always tried every batch before me because “if it’s got fetanyl in it, I’m a shit person and a shit father and everyone expects me to die, but our daughter needs her mother”.

489,2019-01-04 00:14:13+00:00,"I'm so sorry to hear this. The only advise I can give is that it varys not only by location but from doctor to doctor. I've had a cosmetic surgery performed by the NHS. It was much more minor than this so undoubtably cheaper and easier to get approved, I had a large uneven lumpy protrusive scar cut out and sewn back up in one neat flat line - I think it was about a 45 minutes  I was under rather than this surgery of many hours so again I do understand it was easier to get I'm only telling the story because I think it shows what a big difference who you see can make in a siutation where a human has to judge if it has a big enough impact on your mental wellbeing. The first doctor I saw about the fact I was unhappy about it basically told me I was just being a stereotypical insecure teenager (I was 16) and dismissed it on the spot telling me I can either learn to live with it or find the money to change it without even a proper conversation.  A few months later I brought it up with another doctor when I was visting for something else. He had a long conversation with me about it and asked lots of questions on how it effected my life and after a lot of deliberation refered me to a surgeon. He explained that it would be a long wait because it was very low priorety with NHS plastic surgeons usually focusing on reconstructions and such I guess but I was very happy knowing it would eventually be fixed. These were two GPs at \*the same practice\* 

The scar origionally came from a surgery I had and the reason it was so bad was because while I was morphined up I had scratched a load of stitches out. A couple of weeks after seeing the second GP I had a follow up consultation with the Dr from my origionall surgery. I mentioned to him about the conversation I had with the GP and without any more questions he said something along the lines of ""cancel that and I will refer you to someone I personally know and recommend within this hospital and it will be done within 2 months"" and it was. 

So I think my point is that if someone says no don't be scared to ask someone else. And since cosmetic surgeries are only covered by the NHS to help with mental well being you have to be ready to answer personal and hard questions about how it is effecting you completely honestly with no sugar coating.",1

Before surgery she was on 3x300mg carbamazepine a day and took 2x75mg lyrica as well. She briefly tried oxycodon but to no avail. On top of it all she took a lot of ibuprofen and paracetamol. She is convinced the carbamazepine does not work and her pain is almost always relieved shortly after taking paracetamol (ibuprofen is currently not an option due to her recent MVD).

 Teste de alcoolemia e drogas na estrada M-100, perto de Algete (Madri). Jaime villanueva A Polícia Local de [Ibiza](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/eivissa) prendeu um homem de 31 anos na madrugada do dia 1º de janeiro por um suposto crime contra a saúde pública e contra a segurança no trânsito depois de dar positivo para todas as substâncias detectáveis no teste de [drogas](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/drogas_diseno). O motorista deu resultado positivo para cocaína, metanfetamina, opiáceos, maconha e anfetaminas. O teste de [álcool](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/consumo_alcohol) deu negativo.

 Os fatos aconteceram na madrugada do [Ano Novo](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/ano_nuevo), às três horas da manhã. Conforme informado pela Prefeitura de Ibiza, a Polícia Local detectou um motorista que circulava pela calle Riambau, perto do porto, de maneira imprudente, colocando em perigo os outros usuários da via. Os agentes o pararam e o submeteram a um teste de drogas, que deu resultado positivo para as cinco substâncias que o teste pode detectar.

 Depois de revistar o carro do motorista, os policiais encontraram 26 comprimidos de diferentes tipos – 20 rosas e seis roxos – e duas embalagens com uma substância que poderia ser [cocaína](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/cocaina), conforme informou a Prefeitura de Ibiza. Além disso, os policiais apreenderam um pacote com uma substância marrom e peso de 0,15 grama que pode ser [heroína](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/heroina).

 Dirigir sob os efeitos de todas as drogas é punido com uma multa de 1.000 euros (cerca de 4.300 reais) e a perda de seis pontos na carteira de habilitação. Além da sanção administrativa, o motorista deve enfrentar um processo penal como autor de um crime contra a segurança no trânsito. O Código Penal dispõe que dirigir sob a influência de drogas é punível com pena de prisão de três a seis meses, multas ou trabalhos em benefício da comunidade durante 30 a 90 dias e a retirada da carteira de habilitação de um a quatro anos.

Illicit heroin will be adulterated with ""fentanyl"" which may contain any combination of fentanyl, 3-methylfentanyl, carfentanil, alpha methyl fentanyl, alpha fentayl etc. The pharmacology of these compounds including lipid solubility, duration of action is not as well understood. Here is an [Research Article](http://www.fresno.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2017-Fentanyl-Fentanyl-analogs-and-novel-synthetic.pdf) about it I have found. 

From my knowledge of pharmacology, I would guess that these compounds have as high or higher affinity to MOP (hence why they are used to adulterate heroin) and therefor produce a quicker and more severe withdrawal.

-yeah, trumps done a bit for the economy, mostly just his presence really though. Investors saw trump in office and knew things were going up, just out of market speculation. But then we have some things like coal: he did in deed boost this industry. How? By stripping major environmental protections like mandatory cleanup funds and waterway protection acts. Great job. 

-brought troops home: we'll give him this. But wait, we're just yanking out? No real plan? What about ISIS? What about our allies in the area? This is going to make a huge power vacuum and lead to exactly what brought us there to begin with. Not saying bringing our troops home is a bad thing, but just ripping them out? We've just fucked that whole part of the middle east and its gona spread like a virus. Great job. 

 -peace with north korea? Naw. North korea only agreed to talks after *a mount literally fell on top of its missile facility*. It didn't have any chance to continue for a ehile with that, the logical thing to do is get more aid. 

-prison reform? No. This was a bipartisan act that trump simply didn't fuck up. So good job not blowing an easy win. 

-fentynyl? I'll believe it when I see it, china said this in 2016 to Obama. 

-opium field: we do this all the time. 

-the media: it doesn't take a genious to see our media is fucked up. Him calling literally everything he disagrees with fake news isn't a good thing. 

-the trade deals weren't bad, he just said they were. It wasn't perfect, but it benifited all partys well and **quadrupled** trade between nations involved. 

-energy: we've been the top producer and consumer for a long fucking time. He didn't change anything except to stroke the oil and coal industries inflated egos and give them a tighter grip on the throat of the nation. Kudos trump, real nice. 

-military: he didn't rebuilld shit. What are you even talking about?

-being honest: is this a joke? We still haven't got a wall he promised and guess what? That walls getting smaller every day, by his own words. 

What criminals are going to jail? Because trumpnis currently accused of fucking over america hardest. ",1

He had been an opoid addict and was clean for 2 months. They found, fetanyl along with many other things in his system. He was super smart and always knew how much to take. I dont think he was aware of what was in the heroine he bought. I'll never know the real answer now. ",1
525,2019-01-01 02:51:40+00:00,"hope you dont mind i looked into your history a bit it seems like you get quite a bit of oxycodone and morphone. i think its great in this day and age you can find compassionate drs to help treat your pain.


its not really mentioned or i didnt dig deep enough to find out what it was you are taking the meds for though and if you dont mind me asking, id love to know.


about the ""tangent"" as you put it, or typing up a longer message, sometimes people just need an avenue to open up or vent a bit and i dont mind at all so no apology needed. seems most folks these days dont like to type more than what one can read comfortably on a mobile device, but i find its often hard to properly express myself in such a short or small space.

its a tough place to be in where opiates can and do help with your quality of life due to some type of illness or injury which causes pain, but they also provide a high that you really enjoy.


ive been addicted to opiates since the early 2000s but on and off and always just pills. i had just come home from living abroad for more than a few yrs and picked up a serious oxy habit, thanks to a great source and plenty of cash. towards the end of that run i fell and broke my hip. 


i realized that id be reliant on opiates to get me through the recovery from surgery and only used what was prescribed to me no more. then i began to run into problems. i got cut off and have had one hell of a time getting anything perscribed. now im walking again and without a walker or cane but limping and cant go far without severe pain. putting in the work and trying to do this wihtout opiates has been so fucking hard. whenever i get money i do like to indulge and also get some much needed relief from the pain which has come to rule my life. 

i have gotten so desperate for relief theres been several times where i consider seriously just going to a methadone clinic. i mean its sad to say it seems the only way to get access. thing is i dont want to give in so easy and jump to the top of the ladder. i dont want to be chemically handcuffed to such a strong opiate, and one day id like to live abroad again soon!",1
526,2018-12-31 23:29:05+00:00,"This is old but fetanyl is an amazing drug for shit like this. It's just a problem when China smuggles shit over for people to cut with other drugs because fetanyl is so powerful it's easy to miscalculate (dumass plugs) and cause an overdose. Also it's more shit that American companies are pushing onto doctors to use recklessly, just like what happened with Oxy. Now millions of seniors die because their doctor was feeding their addiction and constantly upping doses after companies brainwashed them with their education programs (""prescribe more painkillers!!!"")",1
527,2018-12-31 21:46:30+00:00,"Or maybe kindly go fuck yourself.  I will give any advice I wish, and you are more than welcome to do the same.  I did have psoriasis myself along with Morphea, ocular migraines, muscle spasms, and several gut issues as well.  Doctors were puzzled as all my tests were ""normal"".  I tried everything from otc topical to prescriptions.  There are millions of people that go undiagnosed and untreated a year due to misunderstanding or medical misdiagnosis and suffer from a very narrow list of treatments.  Yet somehow this doesn't factor into options.  No one talks about the medical failure rate of helping people solve their illnesses, because doctors are smart and always right, huh!  

I switched to a carnivore diet and all my problems ""magically"" went away.  There are hundreds of thousands of stories just like mine if you search the web.  She's a big girl, she can do what she wants with it.  ",-6
