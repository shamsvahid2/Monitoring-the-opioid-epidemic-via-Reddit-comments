Ali mislim da je način bio skroz pogrešan.

Ipak se radi o hrani. Teta tu hranu ne može ponovo staviti u prodaju i zašto bi točno morala nadoknaditi manjak od 180kn? Pa nije joj prodala pokvarenu salamu nego nije rezana na način koji je princdza zamislila. Zato jer je malo više narezala? Zato jer je ostavila ovitak? To nisu razlozi da žena mora baciti u smeće 180 kn narezaka i od bijedne plaće nadoknaditi štetu.

Naša heroina je trebala na vrijeme reagirati i sve bi se riješilo kako treba. Laprdala je s babom, na kasi nije gledala kaj plaća i koliko je izvagano i pasivno je pristala na to kaj je dobila.",1

31,2019-12-29 06:15:34+00:00,"I've seen a rheumatologist, but she wasn't too familiar with morphea. It ended up being dermatologists who figured it out. If you can, find a doctor who will refer you to either.

If you do have morphea (which would be confirmed through a biopsy) you'll probably get on a drug called methotrexate like me. You'll have bloodwork done regularly to make sure your liver is handling it well. It will slow down your immune system a bit because morphea is caused by essentially a confused immune system where it's attacking normal body cells, increasing the collagen and turning it into scar-like tissue.

Eventually morphea dies down on its own but the methotrexate will keep it from getting worse in the meantime. 

Additionally you may want to figure out if it's something in your diet causing you this immune response. Autoimmunity is often linked to your gut microbiome which is obviously linked to your diet, as well as lifestyle. 

It's not a hard thing to manage, so don't worry too much. But those are my recommendations, if this IS morphea. Additionally, you may have once had morphea in the past but it's no longer active. In that case you don't need to do anything. This is something a biopsy will confirm. 

If any areas of your body are red chronically, that typically implies the inflammation that comes with active morphea.

Again, it's not hard to manage, so you'll be alright if this is what you have.",1
32,2019-12-29 05:23:33+00:00,"NAD. What about your skin? Is it tighter on the underdeveloped side? 

Reason I ask is because morphea (autoimmune disease) typically affects only one side of the body. Look into it. But if you have it the skin on one side will also feel tighter than the other, like scar tissue. I have it localized on parts of my scalp and when I was little on my face as well. Some ppl have it affect larger parts of the body. For me it's resulted in hair loss, super tight skin in those areas, it's prevented some areas from developing and it has cause atrophy in others (eg dents in my flesh and also in my skull).",1

We were obviously in a highly restricted area of the complex and had security escorts, guards, checkpoints, etc. We had to turn in our cell phones before entering the building through a restricted yard each day.

This yard was where they would load up finished product to be sent out for packaging/shipment. They sent out OxyCotin and Methadone from THE SAME yard.

40,2019-12-28 19:30:50+00:00,"&gt;Why would Ransom expect Marta to realize that she had administered the wrong medicine, would discover the fact, and search for the antidote?

Because she's a nurse who (in Ransoms plan) was supposed to have given him the 100ml of morphene and would assumably recognize the symptoms of an overdose pretty quickly. He took the antidote to make her think she messed up and killed him (which is exactly what happened). The reveal being the switched labels made no difference - she wasn't as stupid as Ransom thought she would be.

&gt;Marta, knowing Harlan is dying, accede to his wishes? Would not a normal person immediately call 911 or drive a dying person to the nearest hospital?

She did try calling 911, Harlan stopped her. He then kicks her out of the room and then when she changes her mind and goes back in, he kills himself.

&gt; A call from the hospital relates that Fran is all right and will recover. With that misinformation, Ransom immediately and conveniently admits his guilt – rather far-fetched to do that immediately, and without a lawyer

It's a Murder She Wrote movie - it's a trope, but it's a trope popularized by this genre. It would be like ending a scooby doo episode with a lengthy legal battle over the lost profits of the haunted hotel. It's silly, but eh.

&gt;Why did Ransom hire investigator Benoit? If Ransom framed Marta, why did he not ask for a toxicology report by himself? The film also has the investigator proving the guilt of his own client -- a first in murder mysteries.

He thought Marta would be as stupid and as greedy as they were, and he needed James Bond to suspect murder (since the police just thought it was suicide) to pin it on her. He thought once she was implicated (and based on her not being able to lie, which he found out when they played Mafia, the movie suggests he thought this would be a slam dunk), her being the reason he died would invalidate her right to the inheritance (the Slayer ruling). The only reason his plan got complicated was because A) Marta wasn't as bad at her job as he assumed B) He got caught by the other housekeeper.",1
41,2019-12-28 19:01:37+00:00," Em outubro de 2014, John Landgraf, CEO do canal FX, previu que a produção de séries alcançaria o seu pico naquela temporada, somando cerca de 350 títulos novos. “Estamos provavelmente chegando bem perto do final da curva de crescimento”, disse na ocasião.

 A previsão do executivo embutia o receio de que a [indústria audiovisual americana estivesse criando uma bolha, que mais cedo ou mais tarde iria estourar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2014/10/1526670-o-fantasma-da-bolha.shtml). “Para os programadores, essa bolha criou o enorme desafio de encontrar histórias originais atraentes e o nível de talento necessário para sustentá-las.”

 Ano após ano, desde que esta previsão foi feita, o executivo é lembrado de que a curva de crescimento segue constante, sem dar sinais de refluxo. A previsão mais recente é que se chegue perto de 500 novos títulos ao final da temporada 2019-20.

 Para o espectador, esta oferta crescente é uma notícia boa, mas implica também em custos crescentes. O aumento do número de séries é resultado da disputa de mercado entre diferentes produtores de conteúdo e serviços de streaming, cada um apresentando suas armas para fisgar o consumidor.

 Esta avalanche de novos títulos gera burburinho nas redes sociais e na mídia especializada, com recomendações e discussões sobre os lançamentos. O espectador que acompanha essas conversas se angustia com o tanto que tem para ver e faz as suas listas.

  Os balanços de final de ano também produzem esse duplo efeito de satisfação e aflição. Você lê a lista de melhores do ano do crítico e fica feliz de concordar com algumas escolhas, mas frustrado porque não viu metade dos títulos citados e furioso que algumas favoritas suas não foram citadas.

 Confirmei a hipótese publicando nas minhas redes sociais as listas de melhores séries do ano [da revista The Economist (com 11 títulos)](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/12/20/the-best-television-shows-of-the-year-as-chosen-by-the-economist) e do jornal [The New York Times (com 12)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/arts/television/best-tv-shows.html?). Elas têm seis títulos em comum: [“Succession” ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/09/bastidores-do-negocio-da-noticia.shtml)e “Watchmen” (HBO), [“Fleabag” (Amazon)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/07/anti-heroina-em-busca-de-cumplicidade.shtml), “Inacreditável ”, “Boneca Russa” e “Olhos que Condenam” (Netflix).

 As outras séries citadas são: “Chernobyl” e “Barry” (HBO), “The Crown”, “Tuca &amp; Bertie”, “Pose” e “Documentary Now!” (Netflix), “The Imagineering Story” (Disney), “Better Things” (FX), “Catastrophe” (Amazon), “Pen15” (Hulu) e “Undone” (Amazon).

 Quantas séries os críticos viram para chegar a tais listas? Tentando fazer a minha, cheguei ao número de 53 séries vistas neste ano. Várias outras abandonei pelo caminho. Como dizem: a vida é muito curta para ver uma série ruim até o fim.

 Sei que 53 não é muito (o meu ofício exige que eu veja novelas também). Assim, o mais honesto é dizer que estas são as nove melhores séries que EU vi no ano.

 [“Fleabag” encabeça a lista. ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/07/anti-heroina-em-busca-de-cumplicidade.shtml)A segunda temporada da série criada, escrita e protagonizada pela atriz Phoebe Waller-Bridge é realmente desconcertante. Ela narra as estripulias de uma moça independente, valente e desbocada, mas também autodestrutiva, frágil e malvada.

[“Succession”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/09/bastidores-do-negocio-da-noticia.shtml), sobre uma família dona de um império de mídia, é uma série cuja segunda temporada é ainda mais impactante que a primeira. A sétima e última temporada de [“Veep” (HBO)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/04/veep-e-um-consolo-para-quem-esta-desesperado-com-a-situacao-politica.shtml), com suas alusões aos dias atuais, foi espetacular. [“O Método Kominsky” (Netflix)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/11/rir-para-nao-chorar.shtml) encara as agruras do envelhecimento em ritmo de tragicomédia, com pouca piedade e muito humor negro.

 Três séries brasileiras merecem destaque por aliar bons temas, roteiros bem escritos, ótimos elencos, produção impecável e excelente entretenimento: [“Irmãos Freitas” (Turner)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/11/do-retrato-a-caricatura.shtml), [“Filhos da Pátria”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/11/rir-para-nao-chorar.shtml) e “Sob Pressão” (Globo).

 Por fim, cito duas séries, a americana “Euphoria” (HBO) e a brasileira [“Sintonia” (Netflix)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/12/didatismo-e-urgencia.shtml), destinadas a públicos jovens, que me interessaram por mostrar realidades que desconheço.",1

It's not pleasant at all. I had to do that myself after having a pain clinic switch me from a non-narcotic med to fentantyl when i got pregnant(still can't find anyone who can explain that logic). I was on fentanyl for 5 or 6 months, going from doctor to doctor asking to be taken as a patient, before i found a neurologist willing to take me off it during pregnancy. I had to stay bed-bound and hooked up to all manner of monitors while they kept me sedated with high doses of IV benadryl. It was only partially effective, for an hour or 2 at a time, and my stay there was hell. After 5 days i was good to go home, and baby was perfectly healthy and had no withdrawal at birth. Unfortunately kiddo WAS hooked along with me in the womb and is probably predisposed to dependency on opiates as a result. I worry about that, especially since addiction runs through the whole family on both sides.
 
Most people will not have these resources available to them and the only reason i did was good insurance covering everything, a history of pregnancy complications and other medical issues that necessitated a team of doctors from several specialties coordinating their efforts, and access to a hospital that could provide all this.",1

47,2019-12-27 20:57:58+00:00,"Please stay off the dope.  I was lucky and never fell into heroin addiction, but lord knows I tried.  I had a good friend, he was a professional in his field, a college professor even.  He was a 20+ years addict but you wouldn’t know it to meet him.  The fentonyl movement caught him off guard.

He was not the first or the last of friends to be taken.  I guess my point is that heroin is a beast and no amount of experience can stave off the chance of death.

Another friend was clean for several years.  After some accident she found herself in pain but the hospital wouldn’t give her any opioids due to her record of abuse.  She decided to help herself to a little more dope and it dropped her.  

We all knew 20 years ago that the government was spurring on the opioid epidemic.  I remember OxyContin hitting the street and predicting the follow of heroin.",1

49,2019-12-27 08:23:25+00:00,"Currently on a run (week 37- vanilla game btw) with honestly not a lot of the bosses defeated. Long story short I lost 2 people on my main group of 4 and lost my entire 2nd best team. After losing 6 of my highest characters and 12 best magic items I kinda want to start a fresh run and do it the right way. Here are my questions:

1. Is it better to level up most of your characters at the same rate equally or have a 'Top/higher lvl' team of 4?
2. Is it important to kill bosses? I don't see any penalty for not doing it and collecting loot normally from dungeons etc
3. I never used the Abom, Occ, Antiq, Leper and very rarely the Arbalest. I felt they were too bad/limiting, am I missing something? Should I be using them?
4. What should I focus on early in my run? Say the first 15 weeks or so. Upgrades, gold, magic item hunting for my main party? etc

Thats all the questions I have now, I will likely have more later. Thanks in advance!",1
50,2019-12-27 05:29:33+00:00,"Some changes such as walp and shuirin will be included in the next rev. I personally have a lot of success with chrossy and v.miku against top 5/10 players. Chrossy for example is one of the two only heroes that does a full team quick (sort is the other), and with her slow resist passive it guarantee any quick for front 3 heroes to complete. It could also be somewhat gear dependent but human rangers and therian mages have a lot of good options. So I still do favor them being S tier heroes at this time. They're not as good as sort and levi respectively but I don't want to go into fractional rating where I would ideally place them between S and A. 

Guangmei is actually a very interesting hero, I don't think anyone figured out how to properly roll her yet, but some teams with guangmei are incredibly hard to beat because it is very difficult to kill her. If you run a team that can sustain with some heals or a bit tanky, I think that's definitely an A team. 

Esquire I think is still core right now, it's hard to counter esquire without nailing down every other ranged elf in terms of new hero releases from ateam. I would not recommend any average player to abandon esquire for any other choices other than maybe levi or morphea backline in a specialized team with sort support.

Thanks for your feedback, noticed you mentioned some new heroes not released yet, when I get more familiar with them or when they get global release, i will input them as well. Happy holidays",1
51,2019-12-26 22:12:09+00:00," **A [Natalia Tena](https://smoda.elpais.com/tag/natalia-tena/) (Londres, 1984) y a [Quim Gutiérrez](https://smoda.elpais.com/tag/quim-gutierrez/) (Barcelona, 1981) no les interesan las citas *online*. De hecho, los dos dicen que nunca han tenido una.** Ahora ambos protagonizan *Te quiero, imbécil* (en los cines el 17 de enero), donde Marcos, el personaje de Gutiérrez, es un treintañero abandonado por su novia de toda la vida que busca la solución a su crisis personal en gurús de Internet y aplicaciones de citas. Al contrario que Marcos, el catalán no es muy dado al [mundo digital](https://www.instagram.com/quimyo/). «Estoy haciendo un proceso de desconexión, si pudiera volver al 3G, mejor que el 5G. No me interesa nada estar conectado de forma permanente. El cerebro no puede estar eternamente entretenido, nos estamos cargando los procesos de silencio que necesita para metabolizar las cosas. Los daños que eso provocará no se verán hasta dentro de un tiempo», argumenta. [Tena](https://smoda.elpais.com/celebrities/natalia-tena-el-cine-infantil-necesita-una-heroina-lesbiana/), pese a haber participado en fenómenos como *Harry Potter* –fue la bruja Nymphadora Tonks en cuatro películas– y la serie [*Juego de tronos*](https://smoda.elpais.com/tag/juego-de-tronos/) –donde era la salvaje Osha, que acompañó más allá del muro a Brandon Stark–, permanece ajena a la fama de las redes. Utiliza su [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nattenalady/?hl=es) para hablar de viajes, amigos y mascotas, vive desde los 27 años en un barco que mueve por los canales de Londres cuando siente que su espíritu nómada necesita una mudanza y afirma que solo se da cuenta de la magnitud de algunos de sus proyectos cuando ve hordas de fans en los estrenos.

 Anda descalza por el estudio fotográfico, cuenta que viene de hacer el Camino de Santiago con su mejor amiga y que lloró al pisar la plaza del Obradoiro, en Santiago de Compostela: «Fue raro, es algo que te sale. Soy completamente atea, pero soy humana, me emociono». Quiere repetir la experiencia, pero por otra ruta, descubrir a fondo España, el país del que sus padres emigraron rumbo Londres durante el franquismo. «Mi madre, que trabajaba en Naciones Unidas, siempre habla de cómo una persona, un político, puede afectar muchísimo a una sociedad», reflexiona, y luego subraya su postura anti-Brexit: **«****Me considero europea, es una locura lo que está pasando». En su español con acento inglés recuerda los veranos en Hornachos (Extremadura), donde «pensaban que era la guiri» y que en Inglaterra, a su vez, la veían como «un bicho raro, una chica regordita, con *piercings* y rastas piojosas».**

 Tena ha trabajado en ‘Juego de tronos’ y Gutiérrez estrena el 31 de diciembre la serie ‘El vecino’ en Netflix. Foto: Fede Delibes

 Ese bicho raro llamó la atención de uno de sus profesores en [Bedales School](https://www.bedales.org.uk), un prestigioso internado situado a una hora y media al sur de Londres, célebre por fomentar las artes y la creatividad en un entorno natural, también escuela de Daniel Day-Lewis, Poppy y Cara Delevingne o Lily Allen. «Me pillaron fumando. Si se acumulaban las faltas te podían expulsar. Mi profesor de teatro me mandó a una sala y yo creía que era un cuarto de castigo, pero era un *casting*. Ahí conseguí mi primer papel». De esa forma, por pura casualidad, a los 16 años rodó su primera película, *Un niño adulto, *adaptación de la novela de Nick Hornby protagonizada por Hugh Grant y Rachel Weisz. No pensaba seguir en ese mundo, su idea al acabar en Bedales era irse a estudiar Filosofía en Australia o a desarrollar su carrera musical en la universidad especializada de Berklee, en Boston. Cuenta que tenía becas para hacer cualquiera de estas dos cosas, pero de la noche a la mañana sus prioridades dieron un giro. **«Se me cambiaron todos los planes por amor», afirma. Permaneció en el Reino Unido, empezó a hacer teatro y audiciones, creó el grupo Molotov Jukebox… Y en 2007 llegó *Harry Potter y la Orden del Fénix*. Tena no había leído los libros ni era consciente de lo que esto iba a suponer. «Fue una prueba más, como pasó con *Juego de tronos.* Es cuestión de suerte, creo que los trabajos surgen justo en el momento de tu vida que tienen que venir», sentencia ella, que también ha participado en series como *Origen* o *Black Mirror*** y ahora quiere trabajar más en el cine español, donde se estrenó de la mano de Carlos Marquet-Marcet con *10.000 kilómetros* en 2014 y en 2020 estrenará *Baby,* de Juanma Bajo Ulloa. 

 
&gt; Quim Gutiérrez: He hecho las cosas a mi manera, tal vez me habría gustado ser más gregario. La fórmula es no dar nada por sentado
&gt; 
&gt;  Quim Gutiérrez también empezó actuar en su adolescencia. A los 13 años ya era conocido, desde los 12 salía en la *tele* catalana, como Martí en la serie *Poble Nou* y luego en su *spin-off,* *Rosa*. Pero decidió dejarlo, ya no se lo pasaba bien rodando. «Iba a la escuela de interpretación, me gustaba la idea de estar delante del público, que se rieran conmigo. Luego llegó un momento en que sufría mucho las consecuencias de la popularidad de la serie y quise ser un niño normal», relata. **Afirma que «entonces no había ese deleite por la celebridad de ahora, esa voluntad de conseguir notoriedad a cualquier precio, de que si eres conocido no eres nadie».** Tras un parón de ocho años en los que estudió Humanidades en la Pompeu Fabra y teatro con Nancy Tuñón volvió a trabajar como actor. «Yo no recuerdo la idea de querer ser una estrella», comenta. Pero en 2007 ganó el Goya a Mejor actor revelación por *Azuloscurocasinegro* y se convirtió en el rostro de una nueva generación de intérpretes españoles. A pesar de ello, dice que no se siente «símbolo de nada» y que mantenerse en esta industria no resulta sencillo: «He hecho las cosas a mi manera, tal vez me habría gustado ser más gregario. El camino particular está lleno de claroscuros y dudas, te planteas renunciar y te cuestionas si compensa. La fórmula es no dar nada por sentado». El último año ha sido «el plan ideal» para él, porque ha combinado medios y realizado papeles variados (el 31 de diciembre estrena en Netflix* El vecino,* de Nacho Vigalondo, y en 2020 llegará a los cines *Jungle Cruise, *su debut en una superproducción internacional, dirigida por Jaume Collet-Serra, con Emily Blunt y The Rock en el elenco).

 **¿Notan los actores la influencia de movimientos como el Me Too o el Time’s Up en la industria? La londinense confirma que su trabajo se ha visto tocado de forma directa por sus efectos. En 2017 la cadena CBS canceló su serie *Inteligencia colectiva* tras una denuncia de acoso sexual a Jeremy Piven, que la protagonizaba junto a ella. La actriz Ariane Bellamar, que había trabajado con él en* El séquito* (HBO), lo acusó de arrinconarla y de tocamientos inapropiados.** Entonces Tena no habló mucho del tema, pero ahora es tajante: «Era una causa más grande que la mía, la serie se tenía que cancelar. Aunque me había trasladado a Estados Unidos y perdí un trabajo, era importante que pasara. Obvio». Gutiérrez sostiene que estos problemas no solo se dan en Hollywood: «Todos hemos escuchado hablar de rodajes chico-chica donde los límites de la seducción de chico con chica son ambiguos, y sabemos de casos donde se sobrepasa esa línea. Cuando compartiendo el camerino se dice ‘ven a cenar’, ‘ven a no sé qué’… Resulta extremadamente incómodo que tú vayas a comerte la boca con alguien y tengas la sensación de que está buscando otra cosa, o de que te están tocando más de lo que deberían». 

 **Laura Mañá, la directora de *Te quiero, imbécil, *es una de las fundadoras de la Asociación de mujeres cineastas y de medios audiovisuales (Cima), colectivo profesional que defiende la igualdad en el sector. Tena cree que la creciente presencia femenina en ciertos roles crea nuevas visiones de la mujer en la ficción: «Los personajes tienen más profundidad, antes era todo muy 2D, muy planos, novias, madres o putas. Ahora hay papeles mucho más complejos».** Recalca que el mundo avanza –»Hace no tantos años los hombres eran los machotes y los que trabajaban y las mujeres limpiaban en casa y tenían hijos»–, y subraya que todavía hay muchos problemas que deben abordarse, por lo que apoya causas como Orchid Project en su lucha contra la ablación. «Hasta que el mundo no vea a las mujeres sexualmente igual que los hombres no vamos a ser iguales socialmente», asegura. 

 
&gt; Natalia Tena: Hace no tantos años los hombres eran los machotes y los que trabajaban y las mujeres limpiaban en casa y tenían hijos
&gt; 
&gt;  **Según Gutiérrez, la clave para acabar con la masculinidad tóxica radica en la educación y en adaptarse a la transformación de la sociedad: «En el siglo XXI los cambios son muy rápidos, hay tantas cosas que si estamos atentos los hombres podemos utilizar para mejorar…». Lo importante, apunta, es «la responsabilidad individual, lo que uno hace en su día a día, ajeno a agendas que envían desde fuera».** Pararse a reflexionar sobre los temas presentes en el debate social, como el feminismo que, defiende, «es una revolución necesaria después de muchísimo tiempo de un *statu quo»*. Películas y series están contribuyendo a modificar viejos patrones de conducta, opina Tena: «Las historias ayudan a la humanidad. Con más ejemplos se pueden conocer otras formas de ser. Yo de niña veía *La sirenita.* La comparo con *Frozen* y no tiene nada que ver, te das cuenta de que no necesitas a un hombre que te salve. Es importante que eso se",1

I have a couple fun ones I'd like to share at some point for the hilarity of it (Flag with 188% bleed resist, Antiq with 60% PROT, and a Leper with 150% in almost every RES type, just to name a few) As these are ones that I think could get a chuckle, however since I play on Switch I cannot upload my screenshots here until I get a microsd adapter this holiday, and I hoped to post at least those.

When I play DD I like to screenshot whenever a character has a ridiculous amount of buffs (or debuffs) because I find it humorous (another example is my Occ got both black and red plague in one mission, making him have 0% res in Bleed, Blight, and Disease) 

I understand allowing things like that may cause a butterfly effect, but part of what makes DD so special is that everybody has completely different experiences, and every hero has multiple playstyles which can lead to wacky stuff. 

At the very least can we have an * or something like ""stat screens can be posted if something is particularly absurd, or requires somebody to go out of thier way to achieve"" so stuff like quirks would still be no go but stuff like trinkets, dmg, and res could still be allowed. As while the quirk stuff has gotten old, how many people have a Flag with 0 damaging spells with 188% bleed resist? Not many I assume, because that is something you must go out of your way to do. 


I think a limit should be necessary, however due to the vastly customizable nature of DD, I think banning stat screens entirely is a bit too much. Hell not even for a meme, some (like myself) have a few heroes I am particularly proud of raising and would like to show off my accomplishments. 

Sorry for rant. But I'd REALLY appreciate a mod response here",1

I don't understand your point?  It does not invalidate what I said.  Unless you are suggesting this person obtained 6 ($400) Spravto inhalers.  Not sure how they would do bumps though.  Oh, that's right, we can apply common sense here and arrive at the fact that it was not prescribed to them.

Your textbook definition above said ""amounts or by methods"".  Amounts can be argued, but the method can't.

You just gave me the definition above.

Not quite the ending I imagined for the ""it's all a dream"" idea...  I had imagined that Edward Alderson might be the one dreaming everything whilst being terminally ill and in pain, making the basis for the morphene addiction.  That the nightmare was a mash up of regret, opportunity, pop culture references and fear - made sense without needing to understand psychological terminology.  


I feel I'm still missing out on the reasoning behind some things, but my biggest question has to be:  Why is the show titled Mr.Robot?  


If Mr.Robot was the mastermind character developing the dream, that would have tied in.  It may also have been interesting if the ideas around Elliot's abuse had come from Edward's head, as in, the abuse didn't actually need to have happened at all, or maybe it did.  If it was Edward who had awoken to Elliot, Darlene and his wife sitting at his bedside, we would be left with some interesting questions.  As Elliot was the one to wake up, I have to believe the abuse was probably real.  


As an aside, I was positively willing to hear someone else's view as to what our paradoxical existence, that we call life, might be.  A sim?  One of many dimensions?  A loop of big bangs / creation and destruction through singularities?  Something that could play to modern science, but as a piece of fiction...  Of course, this could wobble over the borderline of creating a cult Jedi-like sci-fi religion that'd make a mockery of the big speech in S2, Ep 3!

105,2019-12-22 14:32:09+00:00,"Hello fellow Lupus and RA patient! Our immune systems are quite the overachievers, aren't they?!

I have absolutely never heard of that and if that were the case both my pain management physician and myself would be in big, big trouble. So I pulled up the most recent DEA [Practitioner's Manual](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubs/manuals/pract/pract_manual012508.pdf), and either your doctor is confused or fibbing. Or it's a state guideline. Or maybe he is saying your insurance will no longer cover both. Who knows.

I will say this though, the DEA is making pain management anesthesiologists' lives hell right now, so he may be trying to mitigate damages. Or maybe he's under investigation. Who knows. There is a lot of missing information here. I will say that my pain management clinic no longer even offers Duragesic, (unless your prescription was grandfathered in,) because of the heightened risk of abuse and diversion. Hell, if you're a new patient at the clinic I go to, the maximum you can get is 10/325 Percocet - no roxicodone IR unless you are unable to take APAP - and you only get those if you are also on MSContin or OxyContin. 

Illicit use is damaging compliant patients. I don't know how to convince your doctor to not DC your morphine, and for that I am sorry - he is more than allowed to decline to prescribe you a medication for any given reason. Hell, he could DC your Duragesic because you wore a turquoise shirt on Blue Shirt Tuesday. 

My best advice is to present him with the evidence you have for why you still need the morphine. Present it calmly, do not be accusatory, (since this is such an emotional topic, maybe write a letter?) Maybe he would be willing to continue the morphine if he gave you a lower amount of tablets each month? Go into your next appointment ready, willing, and able to work with him.

I am so sorry this is happening to you.

P.S. Do not use a heating pad with your Duragesic. There have been dozens of reports of accidental overdoses as the heat from the heating pad releases the fentanyl much more rapidly than it does from just your core body heat.",1

But realistically, he probably just doesn't have a phone to call you with ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Maybe he was well known with the PD. If he did get busted, hopefully they put him in rehab instead of the slammer though.

It's always nice to have someone that you expect to be seedy actually come through for you.  My supplier I have now is rough around the edges, from Dallas, been to the Federal pen twice for armed bank robbery, just so you get an idea.

Thank you for responding to me! It actually helps a lot to hear it from someone else who is going through the same thing rather than a doctor who barely explains things to me. I presume it's because the NHS is struggling right now and it's always incredibly busy so they just keep appointments going as quick as possible. 

This whole thing has felt so surreal cos it's all happened so quickly though not as quick as yours. I visited the opticians on 27 Oct 19 was sent to hospital the same day. Surgery on 01 Nov 19. 

I was on auto pilot the day of the surgery, was the 2nd patient in and was drugged up with fetanyl and propofol. They told me not to panic when I wake up because I won't be able to see since both my eyes were patched up. Stayed like that for 12 hours, I was fairly independent before the surgery and just like that I became completely dependent...

I just felt so incredibly angry and upset but I couldn't cry, and couldn't fall asleep over the irrational fear of losing all of my vision when I wake up. A week before the diagnosis a stalker of ours had actually attempted to enter the house by trying to open the door through the door letterbox. 

Also trying to stay as positive as I can be, I'm hoping I can look back 1 year from now and laugh / make jokes about it.

does anyone get or know what oxycodone XR's are exactly.  I get 10mg oxycodone er's each month  mine are round white pills with op on one side and 10 on the other.  so i am confused to what the fuck an oxycodone xr is and if he could get them at a higher does then say 30mg's.",1

My peers see this as a safe alternative to smelling like weed and getting hassled by the cops. I didn't wake up one day and decide to be a heroin user. Life gets to be so hard it seems like the only solution for some relief of having to be me.

I was diagnosed with a 12.5 mm Pituitary tumor in June 

September 22 I woke to a massive migraine headache.  Easily an 8 on the pain scale.   I was brought to the ER that day and given Fentinyl, which did basically nothing to ease the headache. 
A CT scan showed no brain bleed, I was discharged.

The headache persisted for 4 days without much improvement.   September 26, the headache eased, but I woke to my eye doing what's shown in the photo.

I called my neurologist who wanted to see me immediately.  
I was the referred straight to being admitted to the hospital and was put in the ICU on neurological supervisor.  

MRI confirmed growth of my tumor to 17mm

Surgery to remove the tumor happened and the surgeon found that the tumor had apparently outgrown blood supply causing Pituitary Apoplexy.

Treatment and all were hindered by my Stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease.   I cannot have steroids nor can I have contrast for MRIs.",1

144,2019-12-19 15:26:34+00:00,"Thank you very much because I'd really appreciate hearing your opinion on something.

Main question is this - is it at all possible that some of us are more suited to the effects of Opiates than others? Is it possible that we can take them for years without building up such a tolerance that they no longer work?

I'm a 62 year old female and have worked with horses all my life. I have Fibromyalgia, Osteoporosis, have recently been diagnosed with Degenerative Disc Disease, and they're now on about something like Complex something (?Regional?) Pain thingy.

I've had numerous injuries throughout the years from riding accidents, the last being about 10 years ago - fractured skull, elbow, a brain bleed and a 'cracked' vertebrae in my neck. 

So they had me taking Tramadol after a while as I'd started to suffer a bit and am outside in all kinds of weather too. The cold and damp are murder. I found they worked well for me. 

My surgery then fell out with Tramadol (have been given 3 different reasons so far as to why this is) and said I could have Morphine instead. Now, to me, this was something serious. Morphine for God's sake!! But off I pootled with my script for it. 

As with Tramadol, I find they work well, enough for me to stop taking the 30mg SR I was first prescribed, and now take 40mg a day, plus a glug of Oromorph (10-20ml) should I get any breakthrough pain. 

Sorry about this...... 

Have scaled back on riding my lovely horse but if I do, then I take Oromorph about half an hour prior and this makes it possible for me to do something I've loved all my life. 

Now they want me to cut down again and I am digging my heels in because I don't want to. 

My reasoning behind this, which I've made very plain to my Dr, the Practice Pharmacist, the Pain Specialist, all of my family (who are supportive) and whoever else has the misfortune to broach the subject to me, is that if I am lucky I have, at the most, probably 20 years of living left and if I have to take Morphine until the end but have a good quality of life then why can't I? 

I am still working on the farm with the horses, and when I'm really old I have a home there too, and am planning on getting a compact and sustainable pod to go in my favourite field. I am up and out every day in the best and worst of weather, and although I can't do anywhere near what I was once capable of doing, the family I work for are absolutely fantastic and make sure that I don't overdo it. They also bought a quad bike for me as walking distances was getting more difficult.

If Morphine or Tramadol work then why should I stop taking them? Perhaps some people don't build up a tolerance or need increasingly higher dosages to deal with their pain? Maybe our mu (?) receptors aren't as efficient as those of most people? 

I said to the Pain chappie that the only issue I have is that I think 70ml of Oromorph could be increased to 100ml as then the chemist could just give me a bottle in a box instead of having to faff around measuring out 70. He said Oromorph has been proven not to work. I replied that I begged to differ, and, as it is me who takes the stuff surely I'm in a favourable position to judge. 

When I asked if some people were more suited to Opiates in the way our bodies deal with them, he didn't know. 

What do you think? Are there freaks of nature out there who Opiates help and do so steadily over years of use? Or am I deluding myself? Never abused them, always take according to instructions and have never had a 'buzz' of any sort from them...just blessed pain relief. 

Phew, am very sorry, and I bet you are now for being so helpful. I have Aquired Brain Injury too and this is why I tend to ramble....my excuse and I'm sticking to it!",1

&gt; Every specimen collected will be tested for Marijuana (THC); Cocaine; Amphetamines (which include methamphetamines, MDMA (ecstasy), and MDA), heroin, opiates (which include, morphine and codeine), synthetic opioids (Oxycodone/ oxymorphone) known commonly as OxyCotin and Hydrocodone/hydromorphone) and Fentanyl, selected benzodiazepines and synthetic cannabinoids, known commonly as Spice.

Even if they were to somehow appear as a positive on a test, you would be fine as long as you have a valid prescription from your medical provider.

&gt; If your specimen result comes back positive from the lab for a drug that could have been a result of prescription medication, a medical doctor will review the result before any actions are taken.  The doctor will review your medical record, any prescriptions from outside providers, and possibly interviewyou, prior to making a medical determination.  If the doctor determines the drug positive was a result of valid prescription medication, then no actions will be taken against you.

And I should be more careful about what I call a ""fringe therapy"". Maybe ""unproven"" would be better.

Total de acord. Fie le faci pe toate ilegale fie le faci pe toate legale. D'asta mi se pare absurd ca esti lasat sa iti pierzi casa la pariuri da' sa fumezi iarba e ilegal.

&gt; Despre asta e toată discuția 

E, aici gresiti. Pt ca intreaga discutie a pornit de la ""iarba ar trebui sa fie legala PT CA NU CREEAZA DEPENDENTA"". Ceea ce e un argument prost daca pe asta iti sprijini pozitia pt legalizare. La fel si ala cu ""pai nu ma face agresi deci trebuie sa fiu lasat sa il consum"".

In schimb daca aduci argumentul ""sunt de parere ca nu trebuie sa intervina statul ce am/n-am eu voie sa fac cu propriul meu corp"" e o alta discutie si sunt total de acord.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Adică nu poți să pui dependența de heroină în aceeași oală cu „dependența” față de un joc video; și „dependența” de droguri recreaționale e clar asemănătoare nu cu prima, ci cu a doua. De unde și disctincția ta dintre fizic și psihic. 

Da, total de acord ca dependenta de heroina si cea de jocuri video nu sunt acelasi lucru' da' esenta e urmatoarea: ITI CREEAZA DEPENDENTA. D'asta e si stupid sa zici ""iarba nu creeaza dependenta"". Sigur, alte efecte and shit da' tot e dependenta este. Cam cu toti cu care am discutat despre droguri zic cat de safe sunt da' cumva uita partea de dependenta pshica.",1

My only wreck was due to a nasty blowout on I-77 near the I-85. It was dark, and the roads are packed in that area. Rush hour bumper to bumper, but at around 7ish, the same amount of cars, just all going 80+ mph. Lots of trucks.

I had a 98' Honda CRV, front driver's side tire blew while I was in the 2nd to the right  lane, and 20 yr old me thought it was the uneven pavement pulling my vehicle, so I went to merge onto the middle, but it somehow sent me straight into concrete divider, bounced me counterclockwise, went up on the passengers side wheels, and I stopped facing traffic. Only to see headlights of trucks coming at me.

My life didn't flash before my eyes, only calming acceptance that it was my time to die and hoped it would be quick.

Somehow, despite traffic, no one else wrecked. Everyone was able to miss me and a huge semi stopped in front of me to block anyone from hitting me (car was totaled, and lights no longer existed.)

There were so many times that I should have probably died in my lifetime. Hell, my biological mom shot heroin and meth during pregnancy, left me in a baby carrier long enough to flatten the back of my head, swell my stomach from starvation, jaundice, and even the diaper rash needed Dr's care at the ER. Drove drunk/high on wherever as a teen/early 20s so many times like an idiot (drinking WHILE driving was a thing too). Nasty opiate habit could have killed me, and after I signed myself into rehab, two weeks later my dealer died thanks to the same fentenyl laced bunk oxy 30s I was buying.

Still not sure what I'm still here for, but I guess there must be a reason?

Grabbing Ritalin, Xanax, Perocet, and cough syrup by the handfuls to get high.
Posted Sep 26, 2018

Unauthorized use of pharmaceutical and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs by teenagers is a growing national problem. This latest trend in drug abuse by adolescents is called pharming, or the nonmedical use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Pharm parties, also referred to as “skittles parties” is a simple concept: Teenagers take a handful of medications that are lying around in their parent’s medicine cabinet and mix it in a community bowl to share with peers at a party.

These parties can happen anywhere, in a basement, in a backyard, in a cornfield, in a hotel, in an abandoned building or in your living when you are not home. From cough medicines and sleep aids to opioid painkillers, ADHD medications and anti-anxiety pills; teens are hoping to get a temporary high off whichever pill they randomly choose from the community bowl. Many teenagers views prescription pills and over-the-counter medications as safe because they are prescribed by a doctor or easily obtained without a prescription. Opioids such as Vicodin, Percocet, and MS Contin are common prescription painkillers that are the leading substances of abuse among teenagers and adults in the United States.

The “opioid epidemic,” which is responsible for taking thousands of lives each year (42,000 in 2016), began in the 1990s with prescription pills, then reached a “second wave” in the early 2000s with heroin, and a “third wave” in the past few years with the introduction of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Prescription pills and over-the-counter pills can be extremely unsafe and even deadly, when taken incorrectly. A 2013 study reported in U.S. News &amp; World Report found that at least 1 in 4 teens has misused or abused prescription drugs at least once in their lifetime.

The deadly side effects of prescription and OTC medications

Skittling, or pharming, is a party game in which teenagers indiscriminately mix drugs together, putting themselves at risk for stroke, heart attack, or irreversible brain damage. Emergency room physicians struggle with discerning the combination of medications that an individual has ingested at a pharm party, resulting in delay and uncertainty of treatment. Many teenagers may be too afraid to seek medical attention, which can potentially lead to chronic neurological deficits or even death. Prescription pills are on the rise, and with unlocked medicine cabinets, easy communication due to advanced technology, and peer pressure, teenagers and adolescents are becoming more experimental when it comes time to altering their minds. Studies have shown that the majority of individuals who abuse prescription painkillers obtain them from friends or relatives, and ADHD drugs such as Ritalin and Concerta are widely sold among teenagers to increase athletic performance and study habits. In other words, these dangerous medications can be easily accessed.",1

The drug test wasn’t just for marijuana - but for a bunch of different hard drugs that I had never done and never plan to do. Anyways, I took the drug test expecting for it to come out clean when to my surprise - literally every drug came up positive. I’m talking Cocaine, Oxycotin, Heroin - you name it, it was there. So instead of saying to themselves “huh, what a shitty free drug test” my parents decided to take everything I owned away from me whilst I pleaded with them to just get another drug test. Instead, they assumed I knew how to tamper with drug tests so they took me to a local hospital where they tested my urine. The whole process took about 4 hours just to get the results back.

&amp;#x200B;

Several years ago, my cousin died of a disease called hantavirus. I had little to no contact with this cousin, but hearing this news got me interested in researching about it. One thing you should know about this disease is that the classic stereotype virus symptoms (e.g. fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc) are the least you need to worry about this. For reference, this can be compared to an extreme type of ebola.

My cousin was actually working on cleaning a grain silo. In this silo, feces of rats over a period of 12 years had stacked to be 2 inches of strait rat droppings. This is how you come in contact with hantavirus. Once rat feces particulates are inhaled, it incubates in your body for up to three weeks. After, you start to develop high fever (38.9**°**C) , diarrhea, vomiting. Here's the bad part. This disease is a pulmonary/circulatory infection, and literally turns your heart, lungs, and blood vessels to gel while you are still alive. If you don't want to be screaming in pain for the rest of your life, you will be put on high doses of fentalyl. Blood vessels will leak, causing severe bruising. On the bright side, \~2/3 people who experience this hell will live.",1

&gt;*You saying things like ""opioidergic"", ""mitragyna"" instead of  mitragynine, and ""binds to ligands"" shows that you have 0 understanding  of pharmacology and are just spreading misinformation so that kratom  doesn't get banned.*

Mitragyna referring to the whole leaf, not the single alkaloid. Perhaps I could have used better grammar, but let's digress. I'm still looking for that research showing kratom to be adversive to human health. I don't have to spread misinfo, half of the government is already in support of kratom (mostly congress and local govs). That's enough to keep the agencies at bay.

Try telling that to the mainstream media.  I did say this too as well, just using the proper term: ""opioidergic""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Thc isnt an opioid because its an allosteric modulator at opioid receptors. 

THC is not an opioid, you're right on that account. It is opioidergic though, which contradicts your statement above. Even PAMs are classified, see:

&gt;*""An opioidergic agent is a chemical which functions to* ***directly modulate the  opioid neuropeptide systems in the body or brain.*** *Examples include  opioid analgesics such as morphine and opioid antagonists such as  naloxone.* ***Opioidergics also comprise allosteric modulators*** *and enzyme affecting agents like enkephalinase inhibitors.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**Update on the Pharmacology and Legal Status of Kratom:**

&gt;*""Although no well-controlled clinical trials have been done,* ***strong evidence demonstrates that the effects of kratom are actually quite different from those of classic opioids****.4,5,26 For example, at low to moderate doses, kratom has mild stimulant properties, unlike opioids, which are mainly sedating. In addition, kratom does not usually produce an intense high or euphoria.1,2,13-15* ***Importantly, even at very high doses, kratom does not depress respiration.4 Atthe molecular level, mitragynines are structurally quite different from traditional opioids such as morphine****.1,27 Moreover, recent studies indicate that even though the mitragynines can interact with opioid receptors,* ***their molecular actions are different from those of opioids.****""*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*""Based on all of the evidence, it is clear that* ***kratom and its mitragynine constituents are not opioids and that they should not be classified as such****.""*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""*After evaluating the literature, I can reach no other conclusion than, in pure herbal form, when taken at moderate doses of less than 10 to 15 g, pure leaf kratom appears to be relatively benign in the vast majority of users.""*

246,2019-12-12 19:51:52+00:00,"First post here. I live in Norway so the system might be somewhat similar. 

After pain, vomiting and weight loss I saw my familydoctor in july this year. I had 1100 calprotectine so he sent me to a private specialist who had the shortest waiting time. So i did my first coloscopy in september where he saw signs in inflammation in the terminal ileum. 4 weeks waiting time after that I did a MR with contrast and after 2 weeks he diagnosed me with MC and requisitioned biological treatment on the local hospital. This was in October. 

The hospital response was their specialists wanted to do the coloscopy themself which they did in start of november. Still I had all symptoms, had no treatment other then what ive tried to do myself, so me and my girlfriend was starting to get worried and frustrated and trying to get started with some treatment as soon as possible. We were trying to call the hospital and my family doctor several times, telling how ill I felt. 

I got a appointment the 16. Des. For a consultation with the hospitals specialist. 

Last Thursday evening (5. Des.) I started to get severe pain again and was not able to eat. My girlfriend called the emergency room, telling the responder about my symptoms, crohns and that I had a appointment the 16. They denied the call and said I would call back if got any worse, if not I should go to my family doctor (which I was a week before). 

The next morning the pain was slightly better after almost not eating the day before. But at around noon the pain started again and got worse then ive ever felt before. My body started to shake uncontrollable, and by that time we knew this was serious. My girlfriend called the emergency room again, only telling my symptoms, and nothing about my appointment and MB(since we were afraid to get denied again). 

I got my first ambulance ride to the hospital, some morhine that eased the pain somewhat. CT scan showed ileus and small bowel rupture. Emergency surgery with a 40 small bowel resection and stricturplastic at the terminal ileum. 

The surgeon, who is absolutely amazing guy and surgeon, was wonderlingly why Ive not been set up to a elective resection earlier. Because on the MR scan i did in the start of October already then showed a critical stenosis and strain on my small bowel.

I am still on the hospital, doing very good under the circumstances. I can go home tomorrow when my antibioticstherapy is done. But I am frustrated and mad how poorly the health care system has worked for me.

Also I am waiting in anticipation for what the hospitals specialist has to say on the 16.",1

Ah didn't know that about reboxetine and its availability in the US. I don't live in the US but I think atomoxetine could be used in its place if one wanted a relatively selective and clean-ish NRI.

The pain kinda sucks on the first day, I’m not going to lie. But it wasn’t so bad that I couldn’t get up and move around if I needed to. Taking a shower that night and the next morning really helped for some reason. I was able to take my dog on a walk (albeit slowly) the next morning, and the pain had subsided for the most part after 72 hours. The worst of it was gone after 24.

If you’re nervous about the anesthesia, tell them. They can give you anti anxiety meds that will help.

I don’t remember much from that day. Also, ibuprofen worked better for the pain than the fetanyl/morphine they gave me. I might be an anomaly there, but it’s worth having some on hand in case the norco they’ll likely send you home with isn’t working.",1

Perhaps you can combine the Fent with the Bupe - that sounds to me like you could cut off my arm without me noticing. I assume a higher dose Fent didn't do the trick so I guess you need certain receptors to be activated for you to experience proper pain relief?",1

A medida será implantada em 2020.

 ### LINHA DIRETA

 Em caso de necessidade, a pasta acionará o Conselho Tutelar da região em que for registrado o descaso.

 ### VAMOS JUNTOS

 O ministério afirma que a iniciativa não pretende criar uma onda de denuncismo, mas sim mapear problemas.

 ### ME CHAMA

 Há algumas semanas, a ministra causou polêmica ao afirmar que criaria um canal para que pais denunciassem professores que, nas aulas, atentem contra a moral, a religião e a ética da família.

 ### FIRME

 O corregedor-geral da PM, Marcelino Fernandes, afirma que o órgão será firme na investigação sobre a [atuação da polícia na favela de Paraisópolis](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/12/testemunhas-nao-depoem-sobre-caso-de-paraisopolis-por-medo-de-represalias.shtml). “Não aliviaremos em nada! Nosso regulamento é rígido e essa sempre foi a postura institucional”, escreveu ele por mensagem à coluna.

  ### SEM NOÇÃO

 O clima de animosidade na Assembleia Legislativa de SP no primeiro ano da atual legislatura surpreendeu a presidente da Comissão de Ética e Decoro Parlamentar da Casa. “Passou dos limites”, afirma a deputada Maria Lúcia Amary (PSDB), que está em seu quinto mandato. 

 ### RUSGA

 Ela se refere ao episódio no qual os deputados Arthur do Val (sem partido) e Teonílio Barba (PT) [quase se socaram](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/12/briga-entre-deputados-na-assembleia-de-sp-vai-parar-no-conselho-de-etica.shtml) durante a discussão da reforma da Previdência. 

 ### SURPRESA

 “Eu imaginava que teríamos problemas, até por conta da renovação da Casa, que trouxe um novo perfil de deputados [de direita radical]. Mas não achei que fosse chegar a essa gravidade antidemocrática”, diz Maria Lúcia. “Dá vergonha.” 

 ### EXEMPLO

 Ela avalia que pelo fato de Arthur já ter sido advertido pelo conselho em outro episódio, “a reincidência” pode levar o relator que analisar uma eventual representação contra ele a sugerir uma penalidade mais grave.

  ### *PÁGINAS VERDES*

O ex-prefeito de SP Fernando Haddad, a psicóloga Priscila Haddad, a advogada Luciana Temer e o ex-presidente do Tribunal de Justiça de SP José Renato Nalini também passaram por lá.

  ### TELONA

 A atriz Deborah Secco e a ex-prostituta Raquel Pacheco, conhecida como [Bruna ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/08/prostituicao-para-mim-foi-a-busca-de-um-heroi-diz-bruna-surfistinha.shtml)[Surfistinha](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/08/prostituicao-para-mim-foi-a-busca-de-um-heroi-diz-bruna-surfistinha.shtml), vão participar de uma conversa com o público antes da exibição do filme ""Bruna Surfistinha"" em um telão montado na praça das Artes, em SP, no dia 18 de janeiro. 

 ### TELONA 2

 O evento integra a programação do festival [Verão sem Censura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/10/prefeitura-de-sp-promete-festival-com-pecas-censuradas-pelo-governo-bolsonaro.shtml), organizado pela Prefeitura de SP, que propõe acolher todas as atividades culturais censuradas por órgãos ligados ao governo federal. Em julho, Bolsonaro criticou o patrocínio federal a produções audiovisuais que, segundo ele, fazem ""ativismo"", e citou como exemplo o filme de Bruna Surfistinha. 

 ### LINHA DO TEMPO

 Dos 60 trabalhos que serão expostos na retrospectiva da dupla Osgemeos na Pinacoteca de SP, cerca de 50 são inéditos ou nunca foram exibidos no Brasil. Entre eles estão cadernos de anotações da dupla e uma instalação que foi concebida especialmente para o octógono da instituição. A mostra será inaugurada em março de 2020.

 ### SOLTA O SOM

 O compositor Marcos Valle concluiu as gravações do seu próximo disco, ""Cinzento"", que tem previsão de lançamento para o ano que vem.

      

 O álbum, que sairá pela gravadora Deck, reúne parcerias com Moreno Veloso, Bem Gil e Zélia Duncan.

 ### MOVIMENTO

 A Associação Brasileira de Imprensa (ABI), a Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil (OAB) e o Clube de Engenharia lançam, no dia 12 de dezembro, a Frente Estadual em Defesa da Petrobras, da Soberania Nacional e do Desenvolvimento. Ela tem como objetivo a mobilização contra a privatização da estatal.

  ### *NA ESTANTE*

 O desembargador aposentado do TJ de SP Walter Maierovitch, o jornalista José Hamilton Ribeiro e o diretor executivo do Instituto Vladimir Herzog, Rogério Sottili, estiveram no lançamento do livro ""Cásper Líbero - Jornalista que fez escola"", na Livraria da Vila do shopping Pátio Higienópolis, na quinta (5). O autor da obra, Dácio Nitrini, e o jornalista Albino Castro também compareceram.

That scared me from mdma and i found speed out which at the beginning felt nothing from it(remember this is gonna be important later)
And i started snorting more and more with stupid amounts of weed (hade some junkie friends and would let me snort of their stash)this lasted for 3 months and i found out i have adhd this is why speed calmed me down (got diagnosed and it explains how fucked up grades i had in school)i'm not dumb by no means could speak almost perfecr english by 12 and learned german in 3 years.But i didnt stop there i was dealing weed so i had money so i was again everyday smoking, speed every two weeks and mdma every 3 months got into opiates tilidin sometimes,i abused tramadol for couple of months and got serotonin syndrome but didnt stop there tried fentany and i loved it since this day i sweared if i se fentanyl ill runaway but continued smoking stupid amounts of weed ranging from 2-5 gram of weed a day and sometimes beer

313,2019-12-08 15:47:37+00:00,"Hey man I did methadone for a while before slowly cutting it out, and have been sober from pills for years. I know what you mean about being treated like subhuman trash. I was very fortunate that my doctor prescribed me methadone in pill form that I received once a month, like any prescription. 

I was also punished once for being honest. This has nothing to do with my addiction, but I was honest about being on Wellbutrin to the wrong doctor and was treated like a crazy person. On my birthday. When I was sick. I told my parents that if i HAD been suicidal when I came into the ER, they would have made it 100x worse. I learned the same lesson that day. 

I also agree with you about the “opioid crisis” (which is really just a fentenyl overdose crisis) that it’s going to just make it so honest people can’t get the meds they need. Dealers always find a way. 

If you need to talk, my DMs are open. I think I can help you out through this tough financial time.",2
314,2019-12-08 15:37:59+00:00,"The goal with methadone is to get to a stable dose where it is carrying you until the next dose. The only times I ever felt withdrawal were when I didn’t dose in the morning. Usually I wouldn’t even get sick until early the next morning (like 2-3AM) when I would miss my dose. And even then, it’s not a bad withdrawal... that is until you hit that second or third day. When I was at my highest dose (56mg... a lot of people wouldn’t consider this a high dose though) my box was stolen out of my car. I went in Friday and got my take homes for Saturday and Sunday. The next day I woke up around 10 AM. That’s when I realized my box was gone. The clinic closes at 9:30 on Saturdays and is closed Sundays. So the soonest I could dose was 5AM Monday. I was honestly fine until Sunday. But Monday morning I was running to the clinic lol.

My cravings for heroin/fetanyl are really non-existent at this point, when I got on the clinic I had the mindset where I was done with heroin. It was honestly my last option after many failed rehab attempts and doing horribly on suboxone. When I was prescribed subs I maybe took 10 strips in the 9 or so months I was on it. But, the last time I shot dope was the day before my first dose. My clinic (idk about other ones) was okay with testing hot for other opiates/opioids until you hit a stable dose that was holding you over. When I got on the clinic I was just starting to use again after a bad OD (8 days in a coma, hospitalized for 20+, had a stroke, had to learn how to walk again) and I received an ultimatum from my family. My (now) fiancé was doing great on the clinic for almost 6 months, So, I decided to give it a try. Best decision I ever made. I haven’t used dope since. Granted, the first couple months I would think about it, but I had a great support system with my family. Life couldn’t be better now, and I’m currently almost off that too, at 5mg.

I never crave my next dose as long as I took it the day before. And even then, if I could just stop taking it at this point I would. But I ain’t about that withdrawal lol. Slow and steady wins the race, and I’m only doing what my doc recommends.

After I got on a stable dose, where it was holding me and I wasn’t nodding out from it (once I hit 56mg I was literally nodding out for about a week or two on that dose. I had no tolerance when I got on it) I literally felt normal. No high, nothing. Just normal. Even in the beginning when I was nodding a lot, I didn’t feel particularly high.

Like I said, for me it was the best decision I ever made. I got on the clinic August 16, 2016. So I am a little over 3 years off of the shit. Life is really good now, in all aspects.",1

Spend at least 30 minutes online to know even a little bit of what drugs youre putting in ur body. Quit being ignorant.

Street drugs like dope and fake pills are pretty much all fent nowadays.  And when i say fent that is just a general term for dozens of fentanyl analogues.

Fent patches contain fentanyl citrate which is strong and short acting.

Street drugs can contain any of the 20+ fentanyl analogues such as flourofentanyl acetylfentanyl butyrfentanyl acrylfentanyl carfentanil sufentanil furanylfentanyl etc etc.

Theres not much research on them but lots of people like myself get precipitated wds from taking a sub even at 80 hours clean. This means whatever fents im getting lasts 4-5 days just like methadone does. 

Each fent analogue is its own drug and may have nothing in common with the fenanyl citrate patches",1

Usage of opioid seems to vary.  Some definitions specify chemically produced, but even the natural opium compounds can be chemically produced.  Other definitions say anything that acts on opioid receptors, but that is tautological. The best definition seems to be - ""possessing some properties characteristic of opiate narcotics but not derived from opium"".  You'll have to debate that with the various sources.

Sorry for the slow response I've been making this way too long reply. 

Jeez, the length people go to amazes me sometimes, sorry you had to go through that :( 

how can you tell the difference in a scan? If you have any experience looking at imaging or identifying this stuff it's way better than I've done because I honestly have no idea what's going on in these pictures ._.;  

As far as hormones, I go through weird periods of either no period (up to two years even though I wasn't dieting) or irregular bleeding but most of my life I've been on hormonal birth control. My mom put me on an estrogen birth control when I was 12 and went on and off of it at different times. I have more hair on one side of my body. 

I was pressured by my ob-gyn to take a hormonal IUD. I eventually rebelled and switched to a non hormonal IUD.  
For about a year I had severe irregular bleeding. Now it's stopped completely. Still on the copper IUD. I'm not pregnant and the very fine hair above my lip used to be really minor but now I have to shave it every other day. 

I only noticed the asymmetry when it showed up on my skin after developing a skin condition called localized scleroderma/morphea.

 A lot of little asymmetries I've always assumed were just odd variations. 

See below w/ some more CT/MRI scans.

I’m moving in with my sister in a island (where I don’t even think they have kratom) and she has known about my dependency for a while now so I basically have to quit because if she finds out I’m on it she will freak out and I’d rather quit on my own than being forced by my sister. 

I’ve been terrified because every time I quit it’s hell and I can’t work or function. But up until most recently I have some time off too stop. 

This is my third day off of kratom.  I went to a doctor and told her about it and she prescribed me some stuff. One of them being 5mg of oxycodine. I’ve never had an issue with pills and she intentionally only gave me 9 because she didn’t want another problem to arise. 

I’m wondering if this will extend the withdrawal or help it?

1. Nu te lasa manipulat (viata profesionala, personala sau societate).
2. Intotdeauna incearca in ceea ce faci (loc de munca, proiect propriu etc) sa faci ceva de calitate si de care poti fi mandru. Nu inseamna sa iti dai sufletul in fie are chestie ca te consumi prea repede.
3. Nu te apuca de fumat sau daca fumezi incearca sa te lasi. Si tot la capitolul de dependente, never ever ever heroina.
4. Multe lucruri iti vor iesi bine, dar poate si mai multe iti vor iesi prost. Sunt sigur ca printre prieteni sau apropiati, precum si pe acest sub, poti gasi o sursa de informatie buna sau sustinere.
5. Cunoasterea e valoroasa, intotdeauna sa verifici din mai multe surse ceva (precum o stire) dar si sa te dezvolti personal continuu. Aici ma refer o data daca iti gasesti ceea ce te atrage si poti face bani din asta, sa devii un specialist. A doua chestie e sa citesti sau sa asculti documentare, carti etc despre orice. Niciodata nu vei stii de unde vine inspiratia.
6. Fiind tanar te poti orienta la o bursa in strainatate sau chiar munca acolo si sa revii ulterior (daca nu ne ducem dracului pana atunci) si sa deschizi o afacere.

by saying the company will never procure these chemicals, aren't you foreclosing on other potential uses? A quick google indicates that misoprotosol is used for stomach ulcers, oxycotin is a pain reliever (albeit a highly addictive one). By saying that these chemicals will never be procured, as opposed to saying they will never be procured for or used in their capacity as abortifacients, it might be overboad.

Maybe in the last paragraph, add a part (c) for :

The above restricted products and services shall not be construed to forbid products or services (a) that prevent pregnancy via fertility awareness methods, or (b) that are procured, when there is no medical alternative available, with the primary goal of saving the life of the mother in the case of abortion, or with the primary goal of curing *or treating* physical injury or physical disease in the case of contraceptives or abortifacients. No Member shall otherwise be obligated by the Company to perform any service or product that contravenes the dogma or doctrine of the Catholic Church.

370,2019-12-05 01:03:11+00:00," O jornalista Glenn Greenwald interpelou Jair Bolsonaro no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) enviando à corte um pedido para que o presidente confirme ""se foi efetivamente o autor das frases"" em que chamou o americano de ""malandro que, para evitar um problema desse [deportação], casa com outro malandro ou adota criança no Brasil"". 

 O pedido de Greenwald também solicita que Bolsonaro informe ""a que fato, investigação ou processo estava se referindo quando afirmou"" que o jornalista talvez ""pegue uma cana"" no Brasil. ""[É] necessário que o requerido esclareça se efetivamente foi o autor de tais afirmações, tendo a presente ação finalidade preparatória para o ajuizamento de ação penal.""

 ""Aliás, há de se destacar neste ponto, que a adoção dos menores pelo casal, muito longe de se tratar de uma 'malandragem', é resultado de um desejo comum, expressão máxima de amor por duas crianças com suas próprias e delicadas histórias de vida e que, de maneira alguma, pode ser associada ao ardiloso interesse de autoproteção"", segue o documento. 

  ""A postura do requerido, muito longe de retratar uma manifestação da liberdade de expressão, consubstancia flagrante desrespeito a preceitos constitucionais"", consta na argumentação de Greenwald. 

 O texto ainda cita a criminalização da homofobia como argumento para sustentar o pedido. 

 ""É bem verdade que as diversas condutas do requerido, exemplificativamente apontadas por ocasião da presente, parecem ser, infelizmente, intrínsecas à sua pessoa. No entanto, tal fato não pode dar azo a repetidos episódios de LGBTfobia como os protagonizados pelo requerido, devendo este responder civil e, a partir da recente decisão do Supremo Tribunal Federal, penalmente pelos atos praticados contra esta categoria.

 ""Além disso, o requerido afirmou à imprensa que o requerente talvez 'pegue uma cana', o que indica que o mesmo tem conhecimento de fatos, investigações ou processos em curso que poderiam levar à prisão do requerente. É direito dele, portanto, saber a que fatos o requerido estava se referindo quando afirmou que o requerente talvez 'pegue uma cana'"".

But, since people are lazy and I like to educate opioid users, I'll do it for ya':

Go to Wikipedia's ""Equianalgesic"" page, scroll down.  Find ""hydrocodone"" and ""hydromorphone.""

Hydrocodone = 1; Hydromorphone = 4.  

Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) is 4 times stronger than hydrocodone, which also means 10 mg PO (oral) hydrocodone -- divide 10 by 4 -- equals 2.5 mg PO hydromorphone.

10 PO codone / 2.5 PO morphone ... ? po codone / 4 PO morphone

solve for the ?.  so, 2.5 times what equals 40?  40/2.5 = approximately 16 milligrams of oral hydrocodone is your answer.

everybody is different.  also, this does not account for cross-tolerance.  you should not substitute this info for a doctor's advice.

Mingo County has the highest Deaths From Despair rate in the country, at 161.1 per 100,000, and a non-hispanic minority population of 808.  This ends up less than one death per year.

Half of the people on grindr are creeps, and with a small pool the chances of running into them in person goes up. Drugs are rampant on grindr, even in small towns. Avoid it at all costs. We have had enough heroin/fetanyl overdoses already, the gay community is extra vulnerable.

Being out can and will still cause problems at school, especially in a small town. Be prepared, and make sure there's a support system.

As said above, PrEP only prevents HIV. Make sure they know its not a general purpose firewall. Use condoms. Support them, or find them a new doctor if their doctor pushes back or isn't helpful with LGBT issues.

I've seen people abuse and enjoy opiates, but barely any one stops after the long term withdrawals and side effects. When you're already struggling with addiction and living in constant physical torture especially after the opiate pains, resisting getting the fix you've become accustomed to is difficult. I knew people who got hooked on xanax, percocet, morhine, heroin, and basically every mind and physically numbing drug they could just to try and get back to being able to feel normal. Theres everything from from veterans, disabled people, mothers, grandmothers, and before they realized they messed up even young teens were getting opiates for pain relief and that has basically crippled them as bad as the original issue. It led to massive heroin epidemics when doctors cut people off after having them on it long enough to feel these effects and people you would never have thought were and are doing hard drugs just to cope.",83

413,2019-12-01 13:03:08+00:00," ""Um espírito bonito que sempre ficou do lado dos oprimidos"". Foi assim que David Merritt descreveu seu filho Jack Merritt, 25, que foi esfaqueado até a morte em um ataque na London Bridge, na região central de Londres.

 Uma mulher que também morreu no ataque, que foi descrito pela polícia como um caso de terrorismo, ainda não foi identificada. Outras três pessoas ficaram feridas.

 Graduado em direito e criminologia, Merritt foi coordenador, na Universidade de Cambridge, do programa de reabilitação prisional.

  O projeto Learning Together (em Português, significa ""aprendendo juntos"") oferece a estudantes e detentos a oportunidade de estudarem juntos, para ajudar a reduzir a reincidência. Merritt tinha um ""profundo compromisso"" com essa área, segundo pessoas que trabalharam com ele.

 Uma vigília foi realizada em Cambridge, cidade de Merritt, no sábado (30), dia seguinte ao ataque.

 Em um post no Twitter que foi deletado, o pai de Merritt escreveu: ""Meu filho Jack, que foi morto neste ataque, não gostaria que sua morte fosse usada como pretexto para sentenças mais draconianas ou para deter pessoas sem necessidade"".

 Em uma visita ao local do ataque, o primeiro-ministro, Boris Johnson, disse que a prática de reduzir à metade as penas de prisão e deixar infratores violentos saírem cedo ""simplesmente não está funcionando"". Ele defendeu ""endurecer sentenças"", enquanto o líder do partido trabalhista, Jeremy Corbyn, disse que ainda há perguntas a serem respondidas.

 Com eleições gerais marcadas para 12 de dezembro no Reino Unido, partidos políticos cancelaram alguns eventos no sábado. Bandeiras nos prédios do governo do Reino Unido foram hasteadas a meio mastro, como um sinal de respeito às vítimas do ataque.

 A rainha Elizabeth 2ª disse em um comunicado: ""O príncipe Philip e eu ficamos tristes ao saber dos ataques terroristas em London Bridge. Enviamos nossos pensamentos, orações e simpatias mais profundas a todos aqueles que perderam entes queridos e que foram afetados pela terrível violência de ontem (sexta)"".

 Amigos, familiares e aqueles que trabalharam com Merritt têm prestado homenagens.

 **'Bom demais para este mundo'**

 Emilee Hopper, que disse ter sido amiga de Merritt na escola, o descreveu como ""uma das pessoas mais gentis que já conheci e uma alma bonita"".

 Daisy Knock disse que Merritt era ""bom demais para este mundo"".

 ""Ele trabalhou e acreditou em algo que um dia mudará a forma como vemos o mundo"", acrescentou.

 Outra amiga disse que Merritt, graduado pela Universidade de Manchester e pela Universidade de Cambridge, era ""incrivelmente inteligente, com mais alegria de viver do que muitos da nossa idade e mais determinação em deixar sua marca no mundo"".

 O rapper britânico Dave disse que Merritt era ""o melhor cara"" e as notícias sobre sua morte eram ""uma das coisas mais dolorosas"".

 O álbum de Dave que venceu o Mercury Prize foi inspirado na terapia de reabilitação que seu irmão Christopher Omoregie recebeu enquanto cumpria pena de prisão perpétua por assassinato.

 O rapper nascido em Streatham disse que Merritt ""dedicou sua vida a ajudar os outros"". E afirmou: ""foi genuinamente uma honra conhecer alguém como você"".

 Dave disse que ""nunca esqueceria"" tudo o que Merritt tinha ""feito por nós"".

 Integrantes da comunidade de justiça criminal disseram estar ""em choque profundo"" pela morte de Merritt.

 A Prison Radio UK, que trabalha com prisioneiros e várias organizações para identificar os problemas mais importantes enfrentados por esse público, elogiou o jovem de 25 anos por sua ajuda com um podcast que explica leis aos presos.

 ""Ele era generoso com seu tempo e feliz demais em ajudar os outros. Sua vida deve[ inspirar a todos nós](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/11/heroi-de-ataque-terrorista-em-londres-nao-foi-primeiro-a-reagir-veja-outros-casos.shtml).""

 O comentarista de assuntos jurídicos Joshua Rozenberg entrevistou Merritt para a BBC em fevereiro, quando ele estava trabalhando com o Learning Together no HMP Warren Hill, em Suffolk.

 Rozenberg o descreveu como ""um bom jovem, dedicado a melhorar a vida das pessoas"".

 Tim Storrie, advogado que também disse que conheceu Merritt em Warren Hill, disse que ele ""salvou vidas por meio de seu trabalho"".

 ""Seu coração aberto, sua determinação e sua fé na redenção de prisioneiros através da educação brilharam"", acrescentou.

 A procuradora Audrey Ludwig disse que ""seu profundo compromisso com a educação e a reabilitação de prisioneiros foi profundamente impressionante"".

 ""Eu presto condolências à família dele, amigos e ao grupo de prisioneiros"", acrescentou.

 **O ataque**

 O ataque começou no início da tarde da sexta-feira no Fishmongers 'Hall, [no extremo norte da London Bridge](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/11/policia-britanica-afirma-que-ha-feridos-apos-esfaqueamento-proximo-a-london-bridge.shtml), onde uma conferência sobre reabilitação de prisioneiros estava ocorrendo e da qual Khan estava participando.

 Tudo começou dentro do prédio, antes de prosseguir para a ponte, onde Khan foi detido por membros do público antes de ser baleado pela polícia.

 Dois homens foram vistos segurando o agressor e um homem foi visto se afastando segurando uma faca grande que haviam recuperado.

 Um homem e uma mulher foram mortos durante o ataque e três outras pessoas (um homem e duas mulheres) também ficaram feridos e estão no hospital.

 O jornalista da BBC John McManus, que estava na região, disse que viu um grupo de homens brigando na ponte. A polícia então chegou e houve troca de tiros, disse ele.

 ""Eu estava andando pela London Bridge na parte sul em direção à parte norte. Parecia haver uma briga do outro lado da ponte, com vários homens atacando um homem. A polícia então chegou rapidamente, inclusive polícia armada, e vários tiros foram disparados em direção ao homem"", disse McManus ao canal da BBC News.",1
