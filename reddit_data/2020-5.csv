Gre predvsem za to, da treba tem osebam pomagat pri problemih zaradi katerih so se zatekli v zlorabo substanc. Lahko pogledaš  v Švico, ki je v 90 imela poskok odvisnikov od heroina in kako so to sanirali? Dekriminalizirali so heroin vzpostavili klinike za odvisnike kjer so imeli varne prosotre lahko so tudi dobili substanco tam in imeli so na voljo zdravniško in psihiatrično pomoč. V manj kot desetletju jim je upadlo za 90% število odvisnikov od heroina saj primarno ni problem substanca, ki jo zlorablajo ampak drugi vzroki, zaradi katerih se zatekajo v ta način escapizma. Torej  bi morali identificirati probleme zaradi katerih se naši mladi zatekajo v zlorabo bilokatere substance naj bo legalna ali ilegalna in poizkusiti te vzroke odpraviti. Da nekaj prepoveš ne ustaviš porabe te zadeve kar je Amerika v 30 letih prejšnjega tisočletja dokazala, ko so prepovedali alkohol in je samo narestel kriminal, konzum alkohola in illegalno kuhanje alkohola in poslabšal celotno situacijo.  Če pa legaliziraš pa imaš lažji nadzor nad porabo in se znebiš dela kriminala ter še davke od prodaje država pobere, ki pa jih del nameni kot že sedaj imamo pri alkoholu AA podobno društvo za travo in bo veliko manj ljudi zlorabljalo to substanco kot kaže primer Amerike in Kanade.",1

7,2020-05-31 07:03:59+00:00," Há quatro anos o criminalista Alberto Toron passeava de barco, no Rio de Janeiro, com a esposa e os filhos quando foi surpreendido por uma tempestade. Não enxergava um palmo diante do nariz e temeu pelo futuro da sua família. Após uma travessia turbulenta, a embarcação conseguiu chegar em terra firme.

 Neste ano, Toron, 61, diz ver o mar revolto novamente. O país atravessa [uma grave crise sanitária](https://arte.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/evolucao-nos-casos-do-novo-coronavirus/), acompanhada de um vendaval na política com sérios [danos à economia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/05/guedes-reconhece-que-financiamento-de-salario-falhou-e-estuda-mudanca-com-congresso.shtml). Agora é a democracia que ele considera que pode naufragar. “O que eu vejo é um cheiro de golpe, cheiro de milícia no ar”, diz.

 Advogado de políticos como a ex-presidente [Dilma Rousseff](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/dilma-nunca-me-pressionou-como-bolsonaro-pressionou-moro-diz-ex-ministro-da-petista.shtml) e o deputado [federal Aécio Neves](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/pf-indicia-aecio-neves-por-desvios-na-construcao-de-sede-do-governo-de-minas.shtml), Toron se diz espantado com o vídeo da reunião ministerial do dia 22 de abril, em que o presidente Jair Bolsonaro e seus ministros ofendem governadores e integrantes do STF.

 “Foi um desfilar de palavrões e agressões contra pessoas e instituições”, diz. “Falou-se disso, mas não falou-se da economia e da pandemia.”

 Crítico também de Sergio Moro, ex-ministro de Bolsonaro com quem travou embates na Lava Jato, Toron diz que a operação foi o nascedouro do momento político atual. ""Esse autoritarismo é um legado da Lava Jato, porque ela representou uma desconstrução do devido processo legal e forçou a legitimação de atos de repressão a pretexto de se coibir a corrupção.""

       

 **Vivemos uma grave crise sanitária e, em paralelo, uma crise política. Qual a gravidade disso? **De um lado a pandemia, que por si só apresenta um problema gravíssimo. De outro, há a ausência de uma administração efetiva e organizada. A impressão que tenho é que o desenho do projeto Bolsonaro nas eleições não contemplava a vitória.

 O ministro que aparentemente ia bem na Saúde, [o Luiz Henrique Mandetta, foi posto para fora](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-demite-mandetta-e-convida-nelson-teich-para-o-ministerio-da-saude.shtml) por discordar do achismo do presidente da República que queria cloroquina e não queria distanciamento social. Veio um segundo ministro, e [também foi posto para fora](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/05/apos-ultimato-sobre-cloroquina-teich-pede-demissao-do-ministerio-da-saude.shtml). E agora, provisoriamente, está no cargo o ministro general Eduardo Pazzuelo. É assustador, porque há uma dissonância de vozes sobre o que muitos governadores e prefeitos falam e o presidente.

 Moral da história, o distanciamento social acaba sendo relativizado, há uma dificuldade de impor essas políticas, e o país segue como se estivesse à deriva. Eu não vejo a curto prazo uma solução para isso. O que eu vejo é um cheiro de golpe, [cheiro de milícia no ar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/ex-pm-trabalhava-para-bicheiro-quando-foi-heroi-de-bolsonaro-diz-depoimento.shtml).

 **No vídeo que veio a público da reunião ministerial, em 22 de março, pouco se falou da pandemia. **O que se viu naquela reunião foi a antítese do que deve ser uma reunião governamental. Foi um desfilar de palavrões e [agressões contra pessoas e instituições](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/leia-a-integra-das-falas-de-bolsonaro-e-ministros-em-reuniao-ministerial-gravada.shtml). Não se tratou da coisa pública. Esse é o grave da história. Este é um governo que vive à sombra de um eterno golpe que ele mesmo engendra. É por isso ele quer armar as pessoas. Ele quer armar para garantir um regime que ele quer impor. Isso é o que precisa ficar muito claro.

 **O senhor vê riscos à democracia no Brasil? **Vejo risco muito concreto. O jornal Correio da Manhã de 1937 traz na manchete uma [frase do ditador italiano Benito Mussolini](https://hashtag.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2020/05/25/capa-de-jornal-de-1937-em-que-mussolini-falava-em-armar-a-italia-e-relembrada-nas-redes/) dizendo que o povo precisa estar armado para ser forte. É essa a estratégia do fascismo. Afora essa questão, que por si só é muito grave, há os ataques ao STF [Supremo Tribunal Federal] e ao Poder legislativo.

 O ataque ao STF não fica claro apenas na gravíssima [frase do ministro da Educação](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/moraes-manda-weintraub-prestar-depoimento-a-pf-em-5-dias-por-defender-prisao-de-ministros-do-stf.shtml), Abraham Weintraub. Ele fica claro também em outros momentos e, principalmente, quando o [general Augusto Heleno expede uma nota](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/militares-apoiam-nota-de-heleno-mas-negam-golpismo-diz-ministro-da-defesa.shtml), apoiado pelo ministro da Defesa, dizendo que, se for determinada a busca e apreensão do celular do presidente da República, isso não será tolerado e poderá trazer consequências incalculáveis. É uma ameaça ao Supremo Tribunal Federal e isso é muito grave.

 **O senhor considera que está se caracterizando uma tentativa de interferência do presidente na PF? **A primeira coisa que foi feita foi trocar o superintendente da PF do Rio de Janeiro. Se isso se faz para proteger a família do Bolsonaro ou não, é algo que vamos ter que conferir ainda.

 Mas um fato que me assusta é a maneira pela qual foi desencadeada a operação [contra o governador Wilson Witzel](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/operacao-contra-witzel-acirra-suspeitas-de-interferencia-de-bolsonaro-na-pf.shtml). Não é a operação em si. Se há indícios, há a necessidade da operação. Mas o caráter pirotécnico dela é exagerado e me parece que pode configurar algum tipo de abuso e, mais do que isso, a utilização da PF para perseguição de seus inimigos políticos.

 **O ex-ministro da Justiça Sergio Moro saiu do governo reclamando de tentativa de interferência na PF por parte do presidente Bolsonaro**. **Como o senhor vê o papel do ex-ministro da Justiça nessa crise? **A assunção de Moro ao cargo de ministro da Justiça merece uma reflexão, porque isso atina com o próprio exercício da atividade jurisdicional dele, particularmente na época do impeachment.

  

 Moro autorizou a divulgação da conversa entre a [ex-presidente Dilma com o ex-presidente Lula](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/conversas-de-lula-mantidas-sob-sigilo-pela-lava-jato-enfraquecem-tese-de-moro.shtml). Isso contribuiu em muito para a queda dela. E quando ele divulgou, às vésperas da eleição, a delação do Palocci, ajudou muito o candidato Bolsonaro. Ao meu modo de ver, neste momento, ele já estava jogando no time do Bolsonaro.

 **E qual o papel da Lava Jato na construção do momento atual do país? **Esse autoritarismo é um legado da Lava Jato, porque ela representou uma desconstrução do devido processo legal. Ela forçou a legitimação de atos de repressão a pretexto de se coibir a corrupção.

 O legado disso é um caldo de cultura do arbítrio, do autoritarismo, e o presidente Bolsonaro encarnou essa figura na candidatura e encarna como presidente da República. O legado da Operação Lava Jato no Brasil chama-se Jair Messias Bolsonaro.

 **Existem motivos para impeachment do presidente Bolsonaro? **Acho que há elementos objetivos que indicam a prática do crime de responsabilidade. Seja com a [ideia maluca de querer armar o povo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/janiodefreitas/2020/05/gana-de-bolsonaro-armar-todo-mundo-vem-da-sua-propensao-obsessiva-para-a-morte-alheia.shtml), o que é muito grave, seja com a interferência na PF.

 O ataque que se faz e que se fez mais de uma vez ao STF. Há condições jurídicas, mas não sei se há condições políticas. Minha opinião muito particular é que, se houvesse condições [políticas], o presidente da Câmara já teria deflagrado o início desse processo.

8,2020-05-31 01:51:59+00:00,"Here's a really unpopular opinion:

**You are a bad person if you are a social media activist**.

It's almost always self-aggrandization, virtue signalling and making yourself feel better. It's creating your own image for attention and recognition. It is not helping people unless you are an organizer and communicator of which there are a handful.

Most social media activists are just selfish and dishonest people trying to climb to their five minutes of fame using some tragedy or problem. 

I would even say that  being an ""activist"" in general is a red flag. People who just help others are just that - people who help others. Helping people is not activism. Activists have political causes and politics is always about getting into positions of power first and anything else second.  ""Activists"" are people who turn into professional helpers for their own sake and soon they forget about helping and just focus on getting support and funds. They use the cause to advance themselves. 

Activism is not heroim. It is not helping. It is just doing stuff for a cause and usually that cause is you.

You want to help?  Shut up, turn off social media and do what's necessary. Unless it's to inform people then it's still pretty useless to waste time on social media which is heavily manipulated, censored and in constant turmoil because of how subjective it is.",2

16,2020-05-30 20:03:10+00:00," ​O caminho de [Clint Eastwood](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/sao-paulo/2020/01/veja-onde-ver-filmes-de-clint-eastwood.shtml) até seus 90 anos, o que acontece agora, foi tortuoso. Da [infância ](https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/materia/se-eu-fosse-mais-disciplinado-poderia-ter-sido-musico/)errante nos anos da Depressão à figuração em Hollywood. Da oficina de talentos da Universal aos pequenos papéis e desses a um papel central na série “Rahwhide”, em 1959. Não tinha cara de ir muito longe —alto, cabelos cor de areia e tímido, ele mesmo não se via como o tipo certo para o estrelato. A época pedia morenos, mandões, românticos.

 Sergio Leone não viu as coisas assim. Com a ida à Itália e “Por um Punhado de Dólares”, de 1964, Clint tornou popular o caubói silencioso e durão, que chega a um lugar mudo e, aventuras depois, vai  
 embora calado como chegou.

 O sucesso popular chegou aos 34 anos e consagrou o tipo do estranho sem nome em cujo rosto parecia que o sol batia sempre forte. Mas, para todos os efeitos, era ainda um galãzinho do “western spaghetti”, um gênero popularesco, definitivamente menor, de um intruso no Velho Oeste como Leone.

 Mesmo o fato de um diretor estabelecido como Don Siegel o escalar em “Meu Nome É Coogan”, de 1968, e depois ao lado de Shirley MacLaine em “Os Abutres Têm Fome” não parecia credenciar o ator a altos voos, haja vista outros trabalhos em filmes menores, como “A Marca da Forca” e “Os Guerreiros Pilantras” ou simplesmente fracassados, como “Os Aventureiros do Ouro”.

 O sucesso como Harry, o Sujo, de “Perseguidor Implacável”, de 1971, com o mesmo Siegel, não ajudou em nada o reconhecimento dos méritos, no entanto óbvios, de sua estreia na direção com “Perversa Paixão”, de 1971. Ao contrário, houve uma identificação leviana entre Harry Callahan, o detetive agressivo e capaz de infringir a lei para chegar à justiça, e o ator que fazia o papel.

  O que veio depois foi uma sucessão vertiginosa de altos e baixos. “O Estranho Sem Nome”, de 1973, e “Josey Wales, o Fora da Lei”, de 1976, o firmaram no mundo já moribundo do faroeste, enquanto o tipo do tira valentão e com grande senso de dever se firmava em policiais como “Escalado para Morrer” ou “Rota Suicida”. Em contraste, os filmes em que fez o personagem de Philo Bedoe, o caminhoneiro que tinha por companheiro um orangotango, pareciam levar o ator a uma rota, digamos, suicida.

 Os anos 1980 mudam tudo. Apesar de filmes menores, “Raposa de Fogo”, de 1982, à frente, “Bronco Billy”, que dirige em 1980, aparece como uma reflexão profunda o bastante para alertar seus críticos. A história do vendedor de calçados de Nova Jersey que decide virar caubói num circo do Velho Oeste é uma reflexão sobre o deslocamento, a passagem do tempo, a liberdade e o faroeste forte o bastante para tornar ao menos perdoáveis suas incursões reacionárias ao mundo da guerra —fria ou não.

 E de certa forma já anuncia a fase luminosa que começa com “Bird”, de 1988, segue com “Coração de Caçador”, de 1990, que impressionam mesmo fracassando na bilheteria e se firma de vez com a obra-prima “Os Imperdoáveis”, de 1990.

 Clint chegava aos 56 anos em plena maturidade artística, de bem com a Warner, bem-sucedido com sua Malpaso. O que viria daí por diante seria um coleção de obras-primas, algumas incontornáveis, como “Um Mundo Perfeito”, de 1993, “As Pontes de Madison”, de 1995, “Meia-Noite no Jardim do Bem e do Mal”, de 1997, “Sobre Meninos e Lobos”, de 2003, “Menina de Ouro”, de 2004, “Cartas de Iwo Jima” e  
 “Conquista da Honra”, ambos também de 2004, “Gran Torino”, de 2008, culminando, dez anos depois, com [“A Mula”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/clint-eastwood-como-de-habito-esta-muito-acima-da-media-em-a-mula.shtml), de 2018, sua última aparição como ator até aqui, e [“O Caso Richard Jewell”, do ano passado.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/clint-eastwood-monta-relato-angustiante-sobre-heroi-injusticado.shtml)

 Num cinema cada vez mais tomado pela rapidez alucinada e quase sempre inconsequente, Clint impôs em todos esses anos um cinema de tempos longos, tensos, envolventes. Num tempo em que os orçamentos explodem, afirmou um cinema econômico. Numa era de “celebridades”, soube evitar os holofotes.

 Como o caubói taciturno de seus filmes com Leone, e ao contrário do irascível Harry que criou sua outra face como ator, dirige discretamente, evita atritos, respeita seus atores. Sobretudo, preserva a independência, faz os filmes que quer e, mais do que tudo, sabe o que quer. Não é uma má maneira de chegar aos 90 anos em Hollywood.",1

But yes, loads of time release drugs etc come with score lines without being splittable.

And it's a physical grove as well.


But the same problem exist for non modified kinetics as well:

In many cases there's no testing done of how the drug distributes within each tablet, so you could easily have quite se dose variation between two halves of the same tablet.


All of this isn't a problem for us pharmacists though, cause on one hand we got the software that does list whether the drug is cleared for splitting, and on the other hand even the patient information alone tells you the composition of the tablet, so you can infer if it's a coated tablet or drug pellets embedded in a regular instant release matrix etc.


It's a problem when physicians and other practitioners don't talk to pharmacists though.

Cause they'll just say, oh just break your (old formulation) Oxycodon retard (that's what extended release is called in German) to lower your dose. 

Which will get you a slightly high patient in the first two hours, and a very unhappy and in pain patient until it's time for their next 8/12hrs/24hrs dose.




And that's without the crushing problem: The Metoprolol you mentioned would be fine for simply breaking apart the tablet to make it easier to swallow. But some overly zealous nurse (or whoever else is feeding the TPN patient) crushing that tablet into a fine powder would bring a fainting patient about.



Funnily enough there's even tablets that can be split in half, but don't have a groove.



(No printed lines if that wasn't clear, the physical indentation is what I meant. People expect most tablets to have a kinda oblong shape with a physical depression around the equator is how it was explained during university, so manufacturer five the patients what they want, no idea whether that's true though, cause I only worked with veterinary and sterile stuff for a while, so no human tablets.

22,2020-05-30 17:03:17+00:00," Foi no Festival de Berlim do ano passado. Numa sessão para a imprensa, surge na tela a imagem do cantor Seu Jorge interpretando o guerrilheiro baiano Carlos Marighella. [O filme termina sob aplausos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/filme-marighella-de-wagner-moura-estreia-sob-aplausos-em-berlim.shtml) e, na mesma época, começam a chegar ao Internet Movie Database —ou [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home), um acervo de produções audiovisuais que também permite aos usuários dar notas a filmes e séries— milhares de avaliações raivosas para o filme.

 Não, os jornalistas e críticos presentes nas exibições de “Marighella” não se arrependeram das palmas batidas. As pessoas que avaliavam o filme de Wagner Moura online, na verdade, não tiveram a oportunidade de ver o longa.

 Figura controversa da ditadura militar, Marighella contaminou o trabalho de Moura com a polêmica que sempre acompanhou seu nome. Uma leva de gente se enfureceu com a mera existência de uma cinebiografia do guerrilheiro de esquerda e criou um verdadeiro exército para [atacar o longa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/vamos-enfrentar-muita-merda-no-brasil-diz-wagner-moura-sobre-filme-de-marighella-em-berlim.shtml).

 Mais de um ano depois, “Marighella” ainda [não teve uma estreia comercial](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/09/produtores-cancelam-estreia-de-marighella-de-wagner-moura.shtml) e foi exibido poucas vezes. Mesmo assim, sua página no IMDB ostenta a nota três, de um máximo de dez, numa média gerada a partir das avaliações de 42.588 frequentadores do site.

 Mas tramas consideradas de esquerda não estão sozinhas nas verdadeiras cruzadas que mobilizam as pessoas para detonar a imagem virtual de qualquer filme político. Longas de direita também enfrentam a ira de uma internet cada vez mais polarizada.

 É isso que evidencia um estudo do Grupo de Políticas Públicas para o Acesso à Informação da Universidade de São Paulo. Liderada pelo pesquisador em ciência de dados Leonardo Zeine, o cientista da computação Márcio Ribeiro e [Pablo Ortellado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/pablo-ortellado/), colunista deste jornal, a pesquisa se debruçou sobre os 15 filmes nacionais que mais dividem a opinião no IMDB. Na lista aparece, claro, “Marighella”.

  Na pesquisa, o trio coletou, em janeiro, as notas atribuídas a todos os filmes brasileiros listados no site e produzidos entre 1931 e 2019. A condição para participar da análise era que o título tivesse pelo menos cem avaliações.

 A essa lista foi aplicado o chamado índice de polarização, desenvolvido pelo grupo, e que identificou quais eram os longas com as notas mais concentradas em polos opostos.

 “O IMDB deixa uma parte de seus dados abertos, então você tem acesso a planilhas com algumas informações. O problema é que, nelas, os filmes não estão classificados por país”, afirma Zeine. “O que a gente fez, então, foi criar um programa, um robô, que simula um usuário para poder identificar os filmes que buscávamos.”

 Além de “Marighella” –em sétimo lugar–, aparecem na lista os associados à esquerda [“Democracia em Vertigem” ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/democracia-em-vertigem-e-o-filme-certo-na-hora-certa.shtml)–12º–, documentário sobre o impeachment de Dilma Rousseff [indicado ao Oscar,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/02/democracia-em-vertigem-perde-oscar-para-documentario-dos-obama.shtml) e “Que Bom Te Ver Viva” –15º–, sobre mulheres que lutaram contra a ditadura militar.

 Já alinhados com os interesses da direita estão “Bonifácio: O Fundador do Brasil” –o primeiríssimo–, “O Jardim das Aflições” –em quarto–, “1964: O Brasil entre Armas e Livros” –nono– e “Polícia Federal: A Lei É para Todos” –13º. Engrossam a lista os religiosos “Nada a Perder 2” –em segundo–, “Os Dez Mandamentos” –terceiro–, “Nada a Perder” –quinto– e “Milagre” –décimo. Vários deles têm alguma relação com Olavo de Carvalho, guru de Bolsonaro.

 “Como se Tornar o Pior Aluno da Escola”, fruto da mente de Danilo Gentili, aparece em 11º lugar e gerou polêmica quando foi lançado por seu tom politicamente incorreto. E, sem qualquer relação com bandeiras de direita ou de esquerda, completam o ranking “Inspetor Faustão e o Mallandro” –em sexto–, “Diário de um Exorcista - Zero” –oitavo– e “Eu Fico Loko” –14º.

 “Esses três são casos engraçados, porque parecem estar na lista por uma divergência estética, de conteúdo mesmo”, diz Zeine. “Parece que há pessoas que gostam deles por considerarem trash.”

 Mas, na avaliação da crítica especializada, o consenso é que os três são mesmo ruins. No caso de “Eu Fico Loko”, a trama narra a história de Christian Figueiredo, influencer com uma ampla base de fãs que deve, também, ter se mobilizado para elogiar o longa no IMDB.

 Quanto à presença na lista dos outros 12 filmes, que flertam com religião e política, Zeine lamenta. “Eu acho triste eles serem alvo da polarização política que tem crescido no país, porque com isso a experiência cinematográfica é enfraquecida”, afirma.

 “Parece que as pessoas precisam muito mais buscar uma identidade própria na tela do que simplesmente assistir a um filme. Se fala muito pouco de estética, de arte, e muito mais da política. E de um jeito atrofiado, não é nem um debate substancial. E isso cria um antagonismo barato, fraco, sem debate.”

 O fenômeno, no entanto, não é exclusivo da cada vez mais polarizada sociedade brasileira. Lá fora, o IMDB e outros sites que compilam avaliações de cinema também foram alvo de sabotagem por parte de pessoas avessas a temáticas abordadas em cena.

 Nos últimos anos, blockbusters têm abraçado cada vez mais a diversidade. E diversidade pode desagradar muita gente. Foi isso que superproduções como [“Pantera Negra”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/02/pantera-negra-agradara-quem-ve-pouca-densidade-nos-filmes-da-marvel.shtml), [“Capitã Marvel”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/03/capita-marvel-apresenta-heroina-de-poder-cosmico-em-aventura-arrebatadora.shtml) e [“Star Wars: Os Últimos Jedi”](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2017/12/1942769-novo-filme-resgata-grandiosidade-e-recicla-mitologias-de-star-wars.shtml) provaram quando foram lançados.

 O primeiro [atraiu a ira dos racistas por seus heróis negros](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/colunistas/tonygoes/2018/02/por-que-o-filme-pantera-negra-incomoda-tanta-gente.shtml). O segundo, a dos machistas por sua protagonista mulher. Já o último trouxe um combo das duas coisas, com a aspirante a jedi Rey e o ex-stormtrooper negro Finn no centro da trama.

 Quando estrearam, os longas, todos da Disney, foram alvo de campanhas virtuais ferrenhas que queriam boicotar as obras sem ao menos ter visto nenhuma delas. Diante das boas avaliações da crítica e do sucesso que títulos das franquias fariam, resolveram manchar a imagem dos filmes em agregadores de críticas.

 Grupos raivosos conseguiram enfiar milhares de avaliações negativas no [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/), plataforma de prestígio que orienta muita gente na hora de escolher o que ver no cinema. No caso de “Pantera Negra”, chegaram até mesmo a criar eventos no Facebook em que conclamavam outros a dedicarem um dia de suas vidas a sabotar o título da Marvel.

 À época, o agregador de críticas enviou uma [declaração ao portal The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/alt-right-facebook-group-wants-to-sabotage-black-panther-rotten-tomatoes-score/). “Nós no Rotten Tomatoes temos orgulho de termos nos tornado uma plataforma para fãs apaixonados debaterem e discutirem entretenimento e levamos essa responsabilidade a sério. Ao mesmo tempo em que respeitamos as opiniões diversas de nossos fãs, não perdoamos discursos de ódio”, dizia a nota.

 No ano seguinte, com a estreia de “Capitã Marvel”, o Rotten Tomatoes eliminou milhares de comentários negativos a respeito do filme que foram identificados como sabotagem. Para provar que havia preconceito embutido nas avaliações, o site destacou que, em poucas horas, o longa recebeu mais cotações do que a maioria dos blockbusters costumam receber em um mês.

 Segundo o pesquisador Leonardo Zeine, o fenômeno das campanhas de ódio na cultura é amplo e extrapola fronteiras. “Nos últimos 15, 20 anos, a gente tem visto crescer, nas pessoas, a necessidade de defender uma causa. Estamos em um jogo de identidades e o campo da cultura tem sido impregnado por isso. É uma polarização pobre e muito intensa.""",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

But the notion of living with my parents paying me all I want including the 3800€ orders . Together idea of a young adult chilling at parents house getting payed everything.

**TL;DR**: It's about $475 out of pocket for a 30 day supply of Concerta. Why? Just because pharmaceutical companies can and they're greedy pieces of crap.

The actual pill doesn't vary from country to county. The United States is different because our healthcare system is completely for-profit. For instance, the Opioid Crisis here in the States was kickstarted by a family of goons called the Sacklers. They pushed the advertising of oxycotin hard, just short of literally shoving it down patients' throats, and claiming it *might* be less addictive than other opioids. Spoiler: it wasn't.


In the United States, pharmaceutical companies arbitrarily set the price of their products (see: Mark Shkreli). After that, individual prescription insurance companies (which is different from health insurance companies) will negotiate the price down for their clients.

62,2020-05-28 19:41:37+00:00,"&gt; Pretty much every other drug should remain illegal, because one of two reasons. They are either addictive, and addiction leads to crime. There's no way to refute this, it is a cold, hard fact.

I study in the psychiatry and addiction field. There are two things I want to add. This is a long answer, tl;dr at the bottom.

1. None of your reasons by itself is for or against illegality. You base your assumptions that them being illegal means less people consume them and become addicted etc.. If that were true, you would be totally right! From all we know and what I have seen, this is not the case though. Them being illegal actually doesn't decrease people taking them. Last numbers I had are that for every 1€ spent on addiction help, 7€ are spent on prohibition of drugs. All while just 5-10% of the total market volume is confiscated every year. Cannabis legalisation in Canada didn't increase user numbers by a lot, all while decreasing usage of it from teenagers by a good bit. This seems to be true for different substances too. Illegalisation only helps if it decreases use so much that it outweighs all the negatives.

2. But even more important. One of the biggest reason of why addiction leads to crime and high costs, is not the drug, but the criminalisation of the drug. I have a nice paper on that but it sadly is not in english so I will try to sum it up. Take Heroin for example. Heroin itself is quite harmless for the body. The problem is, that average street heroin has around 15% heroin in it and 85% of other stuff. The other stuff is what wrecks your body. Thats also often the reason for overdoses. The black market can also dictate the price, making it quite expensive.

 You said addiction leads to crime, and while that can be true, it doesn't have to be. Switzerland had a huge heroin problem several decades ago IIRC. They no give out diamorphin/100% heroin for free to people who are addicted. There were also model projects in Germany which did the same. And it worked fucking great. It works even better than substitutes like methadon. These people don't have to resort to crime for getting the money for the substances. They can have a normal job, earn money, don't get their lives ruined by the effects on the body of impure heroin. They have clean syringes and there are social workers to talk to. This helped immensely there. Decriminalisation of it in portugal (combined with other programs) lead to 95% less overdose deaths and less hepatitis and HIV infections of the same size.
Of course it costs money because the state essentially gives these people free heroin. But this cost is way less than the cost for the crimes of these people, having to treat their health problems, them not earning money (taxes), the complete blackmarket system and crime related to them etc.



I totally get that the first notion if something damaging exist is to ban it. However, from the experience of the last 50 years (and before) we can say with quite a confidence: That is idealistic and noble, but ignores reality and doesn't work sadly.

Also, a lot of drug problems only are based on the US system. IIRC 4 out of 5 addicts of heroin became addicted from prescribed painkillers  which were given out like candy because the pharma companys lied about their potential. Then you have the LSD problems in 1960-1970. Big part of that was CIAs project MKULTRA were they drugged random people on the street, set up fake brothels to blackmail people and drugging them etc... Also partly based on the US healthcare system but that is a different topic.

I am not saying that these drugs aren't problematic and I would advice anyone to stay from the substances you listed. But from everything I read on it, making them illegal only increases the problem.

&gt; A bad trip can lead to violence very quickly. I heard of a story recently where a guy attacked his roommate with a fake ninja sword while high on LSD. There are plenty of stories of people high on psychedelics losing their shit because of a bad trip and hurting themselves or someone else because of it.

A lot of that is exaggeration. I know that sounds like making ecxuses but I will cite sources below. There was one officialy confirmed suicide on LSD. That man was btw. drugged from a collegue in the CIA. There are definetly other cases, but you rarely read about them in medical reports. Suicide on a paranoid weed response can happen too, just like with LSD and shrooms. It just often doesn't. But I said I will give sources.

There are to my knowledge 4 studies done which compare drugs harm potential. IIRC these were all done unter the lead of Nutt et al. or van Amsterdam et al.. You will find them if you google form them, if anyone doesn't find a fulltext I will gladly provide them for you.

The newest and imo best is ""European rating of drug harms"" from 2015 by van Amsterdam et al.

All 4 of these studies find LSD and shrooms to be the last on the drug harm score. Shrooms have close to no points for ""harm to others"".  From 18 drugs, LSD is at place 18 and shrooms at 20. As a comparison, weed is at place 8.

This is consistent through all 4 studies. 

There sadly is not much research on bad trips but I found one study.

All of the participants of this study had a really bad trip.

To make it clear how bad, 62% rated it one of the 10 most challenging psychological experiences of their life.

Now first, most were caused by their setting. The median dose were 4g of shrooms which is definetly on the higher end. Also, only 25% had trip sitters. 50% plus also smoked weed meanwhile.

Yet, 84% said that they benefited from the challenging experience. 76% reported that experiences during the psilocybin session
led to increases in current well-being and life satisfaction.

There was a part where people could write what they want which was analyzed. And here comes an important part. This was a study with over 1200 people of which atleast 700 said it was one of their top 10 difficult moments in their life. From the review mentioned above, 5 cases of increased suicidality were noted, and 6 cases of decreased suicidality.

Also, while tripping 2.6% reported behaving in a
physically aggressive or violent manner towards themselves or
others.

There is also this (specific though) longitudal study that found a reduced suicidality

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5623475/

We have this population study from Krebs &amp; Johansen that found no increased mental health risks with liftetime psychedelic use, even lower rates for suicidality too https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25744618/

There is also older research but since it is from the 1960s I don't want to quote it.

Tl;dr: You would be right about illegalising them if it decreases use. From all we know it doesn't. The criminalisation also leads to black marcet crime, stigma, more dangerous drug use, less medical help, more infections and overdose deaths, huge costs for the police and state, more crime from users etc.

And last, all research I have seen on psychedelics and suicide implies that the suicide rate is either the same as the general population, or even more often: It is lower than that of the general population.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

&gt; If you are anti-science you are anti-West.

Maybe you need to either A. stop drinking your patients' anethesia, or B. make sure you're reading what you're responding to. Becausae I indicated that political science is not a real science, and you decide to post that ""rightists"" (lmao, what?) don't believe in climate science, embryology, medicine, and something else (don't remember, who cares?). To prove that these political scientists are scientists you bring up Einstein, physicist, and Isaac Newton, renaissance man/physicist, and Oppenheimer, physicist, and Pasteur, biologist/doctor (can't remember, who cares?) In other words, in respose to me mocking dumbass leftist beloved ""scientists"" like Marx, various Marxists, and various social ""scientists"" you bring up actual scientists as if that negates that. It doesn't. Looks like you didn't learn much about logic in Medical school, which makes me shudder at the thought of future scientists. The older docs treating me now, I can tell, they're men of science, and their methods are obviously scientific and follow the modern logical methods of actual science. It seems odd you'd bring up these various sciences, and then *not* bring up the minds of those sciences, but of the sciences that are not even remotely controversial. No one will dispute that Einstein's relativity is science. 

&gt;If you are anti-science you are anti-West.

I agree, that's why I designate those push the men can be women ideology as anti-west, which includes most of the Democrat party. 

&gt;No one else acknowledges you are smart because you have to prove it.

No I don't. A fact is a fact, regardless of who acknowledges it. 

&gt;but unless you actually contribute to society, you are still worthless.

Worthless to who? Society? Who cares? Not me. The only thing that is worthy to me is what I can do for myself. 

&gt;Since you acknowledge you don't contribute, you acknowledge you are worthless. 

Only if I also acknowledge your edict that to have worth you must contribute to society. Which I don't. Logic isn't your strong point is it? Let's hope those elder doctors whip you into shape before you accidentally let one of those welfare blacks coax you into letting them take enough fetanyl to become blues. 

&gt;Untermenschen.

It's funny how liberals point the finger to others as the fascists... 

&gt;You know we work in shifts, right? We have time off...

Maybe you should go about reading peer reviewed studies, honing your craft beyond what is necessary for a paycheck boost, instead of wasting time on reddit. Maybe you could use your excellent extra-medicinal abilities to become a renaissance man like your beloved Newton. This is seriously the best use of your time? I'm beating myself up for not reading something more substantive myself, but at least I have chemo brain and it's difficult to teach myself more complex things for 1 out of every two weeks. So at least I have a partial excuse. 

&gt;So you are a leech? So why does your opinion matter?

You no longer like Democracy? You sure do when it's an illegal or black who doesn't work. Then you suddenly want their opinion to matter. When I go vote for Trump, I'll think of you, and how my inferior ass has equal to more say over the election than you. 

&gt;Doesn't it bother you that you are a useless slug that doesn't contribute to the things you profess to be protecting?

I'm currently experimenting. Not going to reveal the findings of my  experiments until it's too late for anyone to use them against me. 

&gt;People like you are why the West is in decline. You think the West is the best, but you don't actually do anything to contribute to it.

The West is in decline because people like you are importing foreigners who hate the West and are trying to destroy the nuclear family. Lol. What could be more stupid than that? Me not doing anything at the moment because I have cancer? Lol. Must make you feel big saying that... ""I support warlords' immigration to the west, but fuck this hick who has slightly different values to me."" Besides, this whole notion that the West is powerful because of science is quite simplistic. Our capital and business is what controls the world, as well as our military. That involves science, but it's science that is useful to power projection. That hardly constitutes your anesthesia. Your anesthesia is good for cutting open people. That's about it.

It all has to do with history and culture. America has proven time and time again it cannot control its economy. So when the Great Depression happened because bankers couldn't control themselves (as well as raising tariffs on imported goods...it's almost comical how we're repeating history) the way we got out of it was WWII. And let's face it, it worked.

So now the thinking is we can deregulate and go nuts with our finances as much as we want, raise tariffs on imports, fuck up the planet (the dustbowl contributed to the Great Depression)  because there's always a war out there to bail us out. And if there isn't one, we simply create one. In fact, we can have forever wars like the war on terror.

And so it goes on and on. There will always be a war to make America great again. And when those in charge reap the rewards, the soldier will return home with massive mental and physical problems. And the state sure isn't going to pick up the tab if it can help it. Fixing that is *expensive.* Let's just throw Oxycotin at them and make Purdue Pharma rich. Cops can clean up the mess when they become heroin addicts and lose their family. If they don't come back, well, the wife certainly can't afford to keep the house, so the bank gets it.

I have read news reports of kids dying or being left with permanent brain damage after only one or a couple of uses, you don’t need to abuse it for it to be dangerous.

That is like saying Diamorphin is harmful for the body because people die from overdoses. Clean diamorphin has basically no harmful effects on the body, it just slows your breathing down. If you take too much that will kill you. Otherwise there is no damage. People dying itself is no indicator of danger of normal use, only danger of overdose.

&gt;  I have read news reports of kids dying or being left with permanent brain damage after only one or a couple of uses,

News are always a good measurement. To quote wikipedia on deaths from nitrous

""Deaths linked to nitrous oxide are rare, but do happen when done incorrectly or overused.""

If you take way too much nitrous you may die. Same if you take a lot of it over a long time.

&gt; Plus, people are abusing them nowadays, a lot more than you probably realise. I seen kids on my Snapchat going through like 10 boxes of canisters in a single session multiple times a week.

That is a problem. And they will definetly fuck themselves up. But it is different from your comment man. Taking 2 breaths of nitrous for a 30 second high will neither give you a vitamin B12 defiancy nor will it lead to brain damage because you stopped breathing oxygen for 2 minutes.


&gt; I just think it’s a stupid drug to use and really isn’t worth the risk just for a shitty 30 second high. Not to mention that these kids are using them whilst high on other drugs such as ketamine and cocaine which probably make it even less safe to use.

No. You have a problem with people abusing it. People taking incredibly high doses, going through 10 boxes of canisters, mixing it with several other drugs which are dangerous in combination.

Anyone who disagrees with you on that is a retard. 

But that is different from what you first claimed. If you don't abuse nitrous it is not dangerous. As long as you don't go through several whippets without taking your time to breath and as long as you don't do it every weekend you are fine and it is not dangerous.

Tl;dr: Abusing nitrous is dangerous. Not abusing it is not dangerous. You have a problem with abuse. Your first comment sounds like you having a problem with general consumption which is different",1

What species are the adopters, what species is the adoptee, and where is this taking place? 

&gt;My name is Kotulg Hivatu, I’m about sixteen now give or take a year. The only reason I know that because “Hivatu” just means fourth daughter in Ki so I had to be less than three when Dad took me in.   My parents are Wa ˈWouyīthë, they’re about the only people that “adopt” around here. It says I’m Kaian on my official registration but that’s was just a catch-all for unknown peoples before the courts got settled in the desert provinces. I’ve got an older brother of sorts who’s Jiˈvusä, but he was a “gift” from a Ki headman which might be the closest thing that the tribes do. 

How common is this sort of situation?  

&gt;Like I said, only the ˈWouyīthë adopt so its not the most common thing but they do have an office for records in each province. Tribal fostering would kind of fit the bill, but you aren’t really tied to them like a family. I was adopted during “The Great Push” so there’s plenty of adopted “Kaian”s around my age. Now that the fighting is reduced to a few skirmishes in the midlands not to many need to be taken in.

What unique problems might the child and their adoptive family face? 

&gt;Ugh, the reporting. Every quarter I got to show up to the courts with all these documents and prove I’m still “An upright citizen; displaying the true and noble values of Wa.” I get it I guess; things are still a little dicey on the frontier but were in Aãɱthel. Nothing spells fun like fumbling through Imperial Wa for five days. My parents said it’s to prevent what happened back when the fighting was still heavy, and they’d used children for all types of things. We still have some idiots whispering about why they picked some girl off the streets now and then but you can’t convince everyone.

How well can the child integrate into their family's society? 

&gt;Since ˈWouyīthë don’t have a lot of clan structure, it’s pretty easy. Even Tuwachāī born into their families have a harder time navigating at least from what I see. I mean if you’re the first son of a secondary wife do you out rank a only daughter of the primary. It might be hard making my own family but Mom still thinks I’m way too young for that and even if I wasn’t I could adopt too. 

Have they bonded? What were their lives like before and what are they like now? 

&gt;I don’t remember much before mom and dad, I could barely walk around then. I’m as close to my parents as any other Waia. As far as my grandparents, its more of the distance but we write back and forth.

Bonus: Does the child have any identity issues? Alternately, what do they know of their true heredity?

&gt;I can’t speak for anyone else but, no. Even if I’m not ˈWouyīthë, I’m still Waian or if you want to get technical Waki.  Honestly, I think my dad listening to his clients is starting to give him the complex. Like last month, his oh so helpful tailor tried to offer him a pair of goats to help marry me off.  One, I just like the food and two I know I’m Tuwachāī… maybe River Ki but, mom said they don’t stray that far out of the floodplain. Shasha, that’s my good good friend, keeps telling everyone I’m small enough to be Âni but I just think she just says that so her husband will let her take me as a concubine or whatever, eww.

 [Em entrevista ao programa Fantástico, da TV Globo](https://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2020/05/24/exclusivo-moro-critica-alianca-com-centrao-e-diz-que-bolsonaro-nao-apoiou-o-combate-a-corrupcao.ghtml), o ex-juiz criticou as [substituições realizadas no comando do Ministério da Saúde](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/05/apos-ultimato-sobre-cloroquina-teich-pede-demissao-do-ministerio-da-saude.shtml) durante a crise sanitária.

 Em meio à pandemia, divergências com o presidente sobre o uso do medicamento cloroquina derrubaram os ministros [Luiz Henrique Mandetta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/em-embate-com-bolsonaro-mandetta-dispara-em-popularidade-digital-e-supera-lula-e-huck.shtml) e [Nelson Teich](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/05/nelson-teich-recusa-convite-para-ser-conselheiro-do-ministerio-da-saude.shtml).

 “As substituições no Ministério da Saúde acho que são absolutamente controversas. Claro que o presidente escolhe os seus ministros, mas são substituições bastante questionáveis do ponto de vista técnico”, afirmou Moro.

 O ex-magistrado disse que se sentia desconfortável com a gestão que Bolsonaro faz da crise sanitária. “[A posição do governo federal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/veja-o-que-bolsonaro-ja-disse-sobre-coronavirus-de-certa-histeria-a-fantasia-e-nerouse.shtml) em relação à pandemia é muito pouco construtiva.”

  Para o ex-ministro, o presidente tem uma posição negacionista sobre a crise. Enquanto ainda fazia parte do governo, Moro [chegou a defender](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/moro-diz-que-isolamento-tem-que-ser-o-necessario-para-debelar-epidemia-de-coronavirus.shtml), em redes sociais, o isolamento social para tentar reduzir a disseminação do novo coronavírus.

 Segundo ele, em várias reuniões o governo foi alertado para o risco da escalada de mortes na pandemia —que [atingiu neste domingo a marca de 22.666 óbitos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/05/brasil-regista-653-novas-mortes-por-coronavirus-nas-ultimas-24-h.shtml). Ainda assim, disse, faltou planejamento federal para enfrentar a crise.

 “Acho que a minha [lealdade ao próprio presidente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/ha-lealdades-maiores-do-que-as-pessoais-diz-moro-apos-bolsonaro-chama-lo-de-judas.shtml) demanda que eu me posicione com hombridade, com o que eu penso, e não apenas concordando com a posição do presidente. Se for assim, não precisa de um ministro, precisa de um papagaio”, criticou.

 Na entrevista, o ex-juiz afirmou que Bolsonaro não se esforçou para implementar uma agenda de combate à corrupção. Como exemplos disso, citou o fato de o governo não ter se empenhado para manter o Coaf (Conselho de Controle de Atividades Financeiras) [na estrutura do Ministério da Justiça](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/12/moro-perde-status-e-sofre-derrotas-mas-segue-popular-em-1o-ano-com-bolsonaro.shtml) —depois de [idas e vindas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/bolsonaro-minimiza-derrota-de-moro-e-diz-que-coaf-continua-no-governo.shtml), o órgão foi parar sob o guarda-chuva do Banco Central.

 Também afirmou que o presidente não apoiou o [pacote anticrime](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/12/nao-e-o-projeto-dos-sonhos-mas-vamos-em-frente-diz-moro-sobre-pacote-anticrime.shtml), uma de suas principais bandeiras à frente do ministério, e que não saiu em defesa da [prisão após condenação em segunda instância](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/11/com-decisao-sobre-prisao-apos-2a-instancia-stf-corrige-proprio-erro.shtml).

 “O governo se vale da [minha imagem](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/angela-alonso/2019/06/so-nao-viram-deslizes-do-heroi-moro-os-cegos-de-odio-pelo-vilao.shtml), que eu tenho esse passado de combate ao crime, contra a corrupção, e de fato o governo não está fazendo isso. Não está fortalecendo as instituições para o combate à corrupção”, complementou.

 Moro também criticou as [alianças recentes do governo com o chamado centrão](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/veja-quem-bolsonaro-ja-nomeou-em-troca-de-apoio-do-centrao-para-evitar-impeachment.shtml), formado por partidos como PP, PL e Republicanos, na base da velha política de [apoio em troca de cargos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/em-busca-de-aliados-bolsonaro-da-cargos-a-ex-ministro-de-temer-e-a-cacique-do-dem.shtml).

 “Claro que existe todo esse contexto de desapontamento em relação à falta de empenho do presidente em relação à agenda anticorrupção, que envolve agora essas alianças políticas, algumas questionáveis”, disse.

 Moro falou ainda sobre [sua saída do Ministério da Justiça e Segurança Pública](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/leia-a-integra-do-discurso-de-despedida-de-moro-e-entenda-ponto-a-ponto.shtml), atribuída a uma [tentativa de interferência](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ao-anunciar-demissao-moro-critica-interferencia-de-bolsonaro-na-pf-e-destaca-autonomia-em-gestoes-do-pt.shtml) de Bolsonaro no comando da Polícia Federal.

 Segundo ele, [o vídeo da reunião ministerial de 22 de abril](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/celso-de-mello-libere-integra-de-video-de-reuniao-ministerial-com-moro-e-bolsonaro.shtml) é uma prova da ingerência do presidente no órgão.

 No vídeo, Bolsonaro se queixa da falta de dados dos órgãos de inteligência e de uma suposta perseguição a irmãos. Daí, faz uma declaração central para [o inquérito que apura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/stf-acelera-busca-de-provas-e-bolsonaro-ensaia-plano-para-evitar-retaliacoes.shtml) se ele tentou, de fato, interferir indevidamente na Polícia Federal, [especialmente na superintendência da corporação no Rio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/entenda-o-interesse-de-bolsonaro-na-troca-do-chefe-da-superintendencia-da-pf-no-rio.shtml).

 “Já tentei trocar gente da segurança nossa no Rio de Janeiro, oficialmente, e não consegui. E isso acabou. Eu não vou esperar foder a minha família toda, de sacanagem, ou amigos meus, porque eu não posso trocar alguém da segurança na ponta da linha que pertence a estrutura nossa. Vai trocar! Se não puder trocar, troca o chefe dele! Não pode trocar o chefe dele? Troca o ministro! E ponto final! Não estamos aqui pra brincadeira”, bradou o presidente.

 Em depoimento, Moro afirmou que Bolsonaro se referia, naquele contexto, à mudança em alguns postos-chave da PF, ante sua preocupação com apurações em curso.

A época do sequestro lulu kamayura(filha dos indigenas) tava pesadamente desnutrida e pelo que vi das informações a tradição indígena na época é de enterrar as crianças nesse estado.

A lei brasileira faz vista grossa a essa tradição indigena de enterrar crianças vivas. E sendo toda essa história verdade pra mim Damares é heroina e não vilã, ainda que ela tenha cometidos atos ilícitos nessa história.

Eu como ateu tenho muitas críticas a Damares, mas essa história ai ta longe de ser uma, sendo verdade essa história(que não é lá tão bem contada) pra mim ela é heroina.

Existem gêmeos na aldeia, mas a maior parte da comunidade não aceita”.**

Por ejemplo la marihuana, científicamente no produce una adicción física, lo mismo con los hongos mágicos o el LSD, son igual de recreacionales y los riesgos asociados a su consumo (motricidad, distorsión de la realidad, etc) no son muy diferentes a los de alguien que ha tomado alcohol. Es más me atrevería a decir que es mucho menos peligroso y malo para la salud en condiciones controladas.

La wea es que siempre se pasa por alto la gente que es alcohólica por que es legal o la gente que es adicta al tabaco, todos ellos son una carga enorme al sistema y no se hace nada por lucas. Y se pasan por alto otras adicciones como ludopatía, adicción a la comida, consumismo, adicción al ocio, etc. pero es por que se obvian los motivos.

Uno puede caer en adicción por 3 motivos, el primero son weas que te producen una adicción fisicoquimica, el segundo es por una tendencia adictiva de las personas por lo que si no se hacen adictos a una droga se hacen adictos a otras cosas (trabajo, videojuegos, cigarros, deporte, etc), y la tercera es como un medio de escape a su propia realidad que no les gusta y que probablemente genera un desapego personal o en otros casos depresión.

Por lo general es una mezcla del motivo 2 y 3, donde algunas personas tienen la mala suerte de vivir en ambientes donde hay drogas duras (motivo 1). Pero el problema principal no son las drogas en sí.

2. My point is that this amount of vaccines is ludacris and is causing negative effects on children and families all over the world, while some people are making insane amounts of money, while having IMMUNITY to being at fault.

I think it is a lawless and crazy situation.

Also please keep in mind the billions of dollars already paid out to victims before this law.

It gets released also by being around someone you love but in lesser quantity,s then the first example. Oxycotin in such sitiuations is fine and essential for bonding.


However when applying oxycotin as medication purely to treat autism it has shown that while it causes the Autistic person to be more empathetic to other people.which is fine if people have good intentions. But  It can cause over-emphaty. Meaning the person will try to bond or trust people that clearly have bad intentions.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

164,2020-05-22 22:44:42+00:00,"Last weekend, [u/BaronZhiro](https://www.reddit.com/u/BaronZhiro/) and I hypothesized about the order in which Jeff Milton's photo sets were actually shot. As a Jeff addict, I've always taken an interest in sets that appear to have been shot around the same time, so I found the extra challenge of trying to figure out their order irresistible. I've spent the past few days examining her sets very closely, taking note of changes in her hairstyles, body weight, tan lines, makeup, and settings (tough assignment, I know) and have sorted her sets into a rough order of when they were shot. I also took a stab at guessing the dates (well, seasons anyway) when I think they were taken.

In the list below, when sets are grouped together, I listed them in the order the sets were released. Videos are shown in *italic*.

Disclaimer: I have no inside information at all, these are nothing more than educated guesses by a fan. Feedback and corrections from fellow Jeff obsessives is welcome!

\---

**SPRING 2013 (possibly even quite earlier)**

1. Walking in My Shoes, Dreaming of Me, Presenting Jeff Milton (purple dress portion), Estao (windowsill portion), Aryud, Breathe
2. Presenting Jeff Milton (wet wall portion), Estao (white backdrop in the studio portion), Precious, Pafarko

The first batch of sets appears to have been shot on location in and around a house with some pretty gardens around it. The second batch was shot around the same time, in a studio with a backdrop.

**LATER SPRING 2013**

3. Enjoy the Seyelence, Fadinu

4. In Your Room, Notlar, One Caress, *Rumuri video* (green top scene)

There's a clear time gap between the first two batches of sets and these here, she's lost some weight and her hair and makeup is very different. Her hair is curled in all of these appearances, but there are differences in the shapes of her curled hair that made me think to group these into these two batches.

**LATE SPRING / EARLY SUMMER 2013**

5. Little Treasure, Be Higher, *Undress Code video*

6. Ensete, Jotzen, Tapjoa, *Allogaj video*

Another change in hairstyle, this time to a straighter, more layered style. These sets were likely shot within a few weeks of each other, but there's a little bit of a time gap as she has some light tan lines in the latter sets.

**SUMMER 2013**

7. Sommar, Tameda (bedroom portion)

8. Postolje

9. Boudo, Luft, Muziko

10. Fireplace, Paiso, *Yes I Am Video*

Very difficult to place these in order, but based on her tan lines, all of these sets were clearly shot in the summertime. Sets are grouped together mainly by slight changes in her hairstyle.

**FALL 2013**

11. Pejalan

12. Exciter, Weten, Klupa

13. Want it All (yellow backdrop portion)

Here, she's added a little weight (winter is coming after all), and though her tan lines are fading she still has a little bit of summer color.

**WINTER 2013-2014**

14. Want it all (outdoors in the snow portion), Floroj

15. Happiest Girl

16. Not Tonight

A little added-winter-weight softness and very pale skin in all of these sets. Her eye makeup in Floroj and Happiest Girl is the same, but one looks like it was shot on location and the other shot in a studio, so I separated them. The order could be reversed, but based on her hockey t-shirt in the ""Want it All"" set intro, and some shots from one of her backstage sets, I'm guessing that was the studio session.

**WINTER-SPRING 2014**

17. Music 4 the Masses, Esque, Always

18. Peace, Convol

19. My Joy, Barbecutie

20. Oh Well

21. Larogi, *Personal, Time Again, and Ultra videos*

22. Plago

At this point, Jeff's first dozen or sets had hit the web, and she and Rylsky became much more prolific over the next few months. The sets in #17 and #18 were shot very close together, as well as the sets in #20 and #21. The videos could have been shot in either #20 or #21, But I put them under #21 because of the bedroom setting.

**SUMMER 2014**

23. Tunggal, Asas

24. Autuno

25. Jinde, Manne, Tameda (outdoor crop top portion)

26. Esedans

27. Iwaon, Banujo

28. Nuzie, Greetz (clothed outdoor portion)

29. Jemne, Leteroj

30. Nirasu, Gift

The team keeps up their prolific pace, at this point getting together to shoot a new set every couple of weeks, it appears. As in the previous year's summer, it's difficult to figure out the exact order, though her tan lines get more distinct and the shade of her hair lightens and darkens, presumably bleached by the sun. The frequent use of gray backgrounds makes figuring the order more complicated as well. #23 and 24 were shot very similarly, but a change in eye shadow color made me separate Autuno from the other two. #25 and 26 were shot very close together, but Esedans was shot in a different location than the other two. Her tan lines in #30 are fainter than in the rest of these sets, so they could have been the earliest of these that were shot, but I put them at the end of summer based on the order in which they were released.

**FALL 2014**

31. Nuria, Opedel, Lito, *Rumuri video* (bathtub scene)

32. See You, Sanra

33. Cubism, Antiq, Tovarna

34. Choto

Her tan lines are still visible but fading in the sets in #31. The sets in #32 are clearly shot at the exact same time. There's a break of a few weeks, then they shot the sets in #33 and #34, all with pale skin and curled hair. This is probably the time period where it's easiest to figure out the order.

**WINTER 2014-2015**

36. Greetz (indoor, barn-like portion)

37. Patio

38. Urunga

39. Gravica, Danetla, Sirkel

More delightful pale skinned winter-body softness in these sets. Not sure at all about the order, but these are almost certainly the correct groupings. Not sure about when the 20 or so shots from Greetz with the happy birthday message were shot, but they don't show continuity with any of the rest of her work, so I'm guessing they were shot as a quick one-off.

**MORE TO COME?**

Based on her backstage sets, I'm guessing there are at least nine more sets to come from Jeff, if and when Rylsky decides to post them. They include:

* A companion photo set to the ""Yes I Am"" video
* A companion photo set to the ""Personal"" video
* A companion photo set to the ""Ultra"" video
* A backdrop set that was shot in the same session as Pejalan
* An in-studio set where she's spraying water on another model
* An on-location set that doesn't look like it's grouped with any of the above
* A set that looks like it was shot around the same time as #17-18 above
* A set that looks like it was shot around the same time as #33 above
* A set that was shot in the same location as Nuzie

&gt;Não abdicam??? Mas tu tens alguma noção do que é a vida de um enfermeiro??? As horas a mais que não são pagas, a saúde que está sempre em risco em contacto com doentes, a saúde mental de ver pessoas a morrer à sua frente, o stress inerente à profissão (têm a vida das pessoas em jogo), o tempo dispendido a estudar e actualizar-se que obviamente é retirado do tempo pessoal e não é pago. Não abdicam de um salário de jeito noutra profissão qualquer? Achas que é o facto de receber um (extremamente baixo para o que é) salário que faz com que deixem de ser heróis? Não podiam todos mandar tudo para o caralho e trocar de profissão para algo com menos riscos, menos stresses, menos cansativo e a ganhar mais? Pois, mas não o fazem

Acho que não leste a minha definição de heroi e ficaste te pelas minhas 3 primeiras palavras. Como disse, herói para mim é aquele que abdica de algo pela vida de outrem sendo 100% voluntário. Desta minha frase repara o que tu assumiste. Assumiste que eu disse que eles não abdicam de nada. E tudo, mas exatamente tudo o que tu escreveste em cima também se passa em muitas outras profissões. Não existe só stress na medicina, não existe abdicar do teu tempo para aprofundares conhecimento só na medicina. Volto a dizer, são das profissões melhores pagas em Portugal e foram por eles escolhidas. Quem quer mandar tudo para o caralho é porque não tem vocação para tal, por isso que saia e dê o lugar a outro. 

&gt;LOL, não me digas que achas que alguém vai para enfermeiro pelo salário.

Mas uma vez, cortaste a minha definição de herói para o que te deu jeito, isso não é honestidade. 

&gt;Completamente abaixo do que deviam receber.

Como 99% dos trabalhadores em Portugal... 

&gt;Não é o dever do estado? Não está a cumprir a sua função? O estado investe muito dinheiro para ter muito mais em troca, obviamente! Os enfermeiros/médicos investem muito mais e obtêm muito menos em troca.

Verdade, para acabarem os cursos e fugirem para o privado. Incrível o que disseste em cima...


&gt;Honestamente não tenho palavras para comentar isto...=/ Eles podem para uns ser heróis e para outros não, mas são certamente idiotas chapados por aceitar fazer o que fazem nas condições que o fazem, pelo salário que o fazem e depois ainda ter gente mal agradecida a falar do que não sabem.

Eles não tinham uma arma apontada durante todo o secundaria para tirarem 19 e 20. Eles não tinham uma arma apontada na escolha do curso, eles não têm uma arma apontada agora. Se calhar e agora estou so eu a supor, aqueles que reclamam tanto que querem ser chamados de heróis são aqueles que foram obrigados a seguir medicina pelos pais e agora sentem na pele o que realmente é ser médico. E  não estou a ser mal agradecido, simplesmente não vou com estas bajulacoes infundadas a quem está a cumprir o seu dever, a quem está a ser pago para tal, o que nos caso dos médicos equivale a 3 ou 4 vezes mais que o salario mínimo, para tal.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

I mean 150€ for 150mg Oxycodon is very common and dude, most stuff from the deep web arent pressed shit. If you are really worried, get a testkit. Also, 150mg of Oxy is a large amount to someone who has never even tried Opioids. Back when i was 16 we would get completely high of like 10, max 20mg; Maybe smoke some weed with it and such a dose probably suffices to get you high af.
Maybe take a look at Tramadol, Tilidin or DHC, Hydrocodone... you name it. Those are way cheaper than Oxy and Codein (these are ALWAYS expensive) and also safer for someone who has never Opioids.
And these are way safer than some random RC that is known to be caustic and very addictive (may be because its a fentanyl analouge...).

 Não espere que Charlize Theron interprete a personagem, porém.

 Quando discutiu a produção de “Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria”, Miller confirmou os rumores de que está levando adiante um projeto autônomo sobre a heroína do filme de ação, que se tornou muito popular entre os fãs devido à interpretação determinada de Theron.

 Mas, para aqueles que esperavam ver a atriz vencedora do Oscar de volta ao assento de piloto, talvez seja preciso ajustar as expectativas. O filme na verdade é uma história de origem sobre Furiosa em sua juventude, e Miller está em busca de uma atriz na faixa dos 20 anos de idade para assumir o papel.

 Miller espera produzir o novo filme sobre Furiosa assim que concluir o drama “Three Thousand Years of Longing”, com Tilda Swinton e Idris Elba, que deveria ter começado a ser rodado no segundo trimestre, mas a produção foi adiada quando o medo do coronavírus forçou a paralisação dos trabalhos na 

[indústria do cinema.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2020/05/coronavirus-vai-marcar-o-fim-de-uma-era-no-cinema.shtml) “Assim, depois que terminarmos, e, com sorte, resolvermos o problema da pandemia, veremos o que o mundo nos permite fazer com Furiosa”, disse Miller.

  O projeto está em preparação há muito tempo. Na década e meia que foi necessária para levar “Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria” às telas, Miller e seu parceiro roteirista, Nick Lathouris, criaram histórias detalhadas sobre os antecedentes dos personagens, do antagonista Immortan Joe ao Doof Warrior, um papel relativamente pequeno, de um guerreiro armado com uma guitarra que lança chamas.

 Mas foi Furiosa que recebeu a maior parte de sua atenção. Miller buscou responder a perguntas sobre como era a vida da personagem no idílico “Green Place”, por que ela foi escolhida em meio ao grupo de guerreiras conhecidas como Vuvalini e como ela se tornou a lutadora implacável que encontramos no momento em que a história de “Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria” começa.

 “Foi simplesmente uma maneira de ajudar Charlize e de explicar a história para nós mesmos”, disse Miller.

 Mas eles consideraram que a história pregressa de Furiosa era tão interessante que decidiram escrever um segundo roteiro antes mesmo que começassem as filmagens de “Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria”. “Eu li esse roteiro ao ser escalada”, disse Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, que interpreta Splendid, uma das cônjuges no primeiro filme. “É genial. Sempre fiquei imaginando se o filme vai ser feito ou não.”

 Durante anos, parecia que não, porque Miller está envolvido numa batalha judicial contra a Warner Bros. quanto a pagamentos não realizados por “Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria”. Mas, agora que ele recebeu luz verde para prosseguir, o diretor começou a testar atrizes para o papel principal e reconheceu que, não importa quem venha a ser escalada para o papel de Furiosa, o desafio da comparação será grande.

 “Eu pensei durante muito tempo que poderíamos usar computação gráfica para criar uma Charlize mais jovem, mas não acho que a tecnologia já tenha chegado a esse ponto”, disse Miller. “Apesar do esforço corajoso em [‘O Irlandês’](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/11/obra-prima-de-scorsese-o-irlandes-o-revela-como-um-anti-coppola.shtml), na minha opinião a distância ainda é grande demais. Todo mundo está à beira de resolver o problema, a começar pelos criadores de videogames japoneses, mas a distância ainda é muito grande, acredito.”

 Ainda que Theron não deva retornar, outros membros cruciais da equipe de “Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria” se disponibilizaram para o novo projeto. Um é o diretor de arte Colin Gibson, premiado com o Oscar, que revelou um detalhe fascinante sobre a escala do projeto. Quando conversamos sobre todos os veículos que ele criou para “Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria” —88 foram vistos nas telas, mas ele criou 135 deles—, Gibson provocou, dizendo que “a nova versão do filme, que está sendo discutida, vai ter ainda mais veículos”.

 Um filme com Furiosa ainda maior do que “Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria”? Isso bastou para atrair de volta o diretor de fotografia John Seale, que completou seu trabalho no primeiro filme em 2013 e viveu os anos seguintes em regime de aposentadoria parcial.

 “Tive ótimas oportunidades de trabalho depois de ‘Mad Max: Estrada da Fúria’, como você bem pode imaginar, mas recusei todas elas”, disse Seale. “Mas no fim daquele filme eu disse a George que, se alguém mais telefonasse, eu estaria aposentado; se ele telefonasse, almoçaríamos para conversar. E, sete anos depois, ele ligou.”

Pain medication is prescribed and a fluid hump is administered to keep her hydrated.

There are two drugs my vets prescribe for me:  

Metacam, a steroid anti-inflammatory used for pain during the first few weeks or days to manage moderate pain.  

Tramadol, an opiate that helps with the more difficult pain while her body prepares.  It also has a calming effect.

Or, the vet can give her a morphine hump that may give you time to make it home and place her with her cagemates.  It takes about 20 to 30 minutes after it's administered.  But confirm this with your vet first.

If you know you won't make it home, it may be best to bring all of them with in a bin cage and let the mophine take effect outside at the vet or nearby park.  Bring a small carrier to place her in for the vet.

Because of Covid 19 the vet will come to your car and take your mouse to treat her and bring her back.

If you go with the morphine and want to make it home, tell the vet you want them to administer it right before handing her over to you.  Explain that you want to pay and be ready to leave before the morphine is administered.

I'm sorry you and your mouse are going through this.

If you can't afford to take her to a vet st least call and ask to talk to one.  Ask the vet what you've posted here.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution.

Só uma digressão: antes de entrar no reddit eu estava morrendo de medo de ser rechaçado justamente por não ter fomação nas áreas que tenho estudado rescentemente (e filosofia é uma delas). Então é um alívio poder conversar sem precisar de uma linguagem rebuscada ou de precisão no discurso. Acho que essa abertura e margem para o erro são o que dão leveza ao diálogo e constroem um pensamento mais saudável.

Feita a digressão: vamos ao Nietzsche ao Poe.

Antes de mais nada, isso que você fez se chama nobreza e humildade haha. ""Não sei nada do cara, então vou lê-lo"". Mas também pode ser chamado de masoquismo, a se tratar de uma leitura pesada dessas.

Acho que a trip de uma leitura de nietzsche só é menos psicodélica que uma trip de Dostoiévski.

Mas eu concordo demais contigo; é muito difícil tomá-los como exemplo quando se observa a vida que eles tiveram. A impressão que surge é que não há *vitória* no pensamento. Não são poucos os exemplos de pensadores exímios ou escritores maravilhosos que tiveram vidas miseráveis.

Porém, ao mesmo tempo, eu me pego pensando: que tipo de vitória, exatamente, estou tomando por referência? Se for uma vitória capital, de fato, esses caras não são modelos. Mas também não acredito que sejam modelos de uma vitória ""intelectual"".

Talvez o maior erro de quem começa a ler esses pensadores é começar a se gabar por tê-los lido. Por esse motivo, a sua visão de que a vida deve ser experimentada (apesar do risco de ter sifilis) em vez de ditada, é uma maneira saudável de interpretar esse pensamento.

A obra que eu mais li dele foi ""Assim Falou Zaratustra"".

À primeira leitura, a impressão que tive era que eu estava sendo convocado a ser um ""além-do-homem"" (gosto mais dessa versão do que a tradução ""super-homem""). Me senti, àquela altura, como o ser superior que podia fazer o que quisesse (isso foi a três anos atrás). E acho que foi sobre esse argumento que os alemães também fundaram o nazismo (mas como Nietzsche repudiava o estado e a supressão de outras vontades com base na violência, o que os nazistas fizeram foi se apropriarem de um discurso intelectual para fundar um movimento social). Contudo, esse sentimento não se sustenta.

Eu tenho um amigo que diz: se colocassemos um homem e um superhomem num ring, o superhomem sairia perdendo todas as vezes.

A princípio, esse pensamento não fez o menor sentido para mim. Porque se um é super, por que ele perderia para o outro que *só é* homem?

Mas na minha terceira leitura de Assim falou Zaratustra foi quando veio a primeira virada de chave.

O grande problema do pensamento metafísico, segundo o que entendo de Nietzsche, é a aposta do valor da vida no que está após. Por esse motivo os códigos morais se tornam tão fortes, porque sem eles não é possível trasncender. E à época, esse código era a moral cristão.

Se só os bons vão para o céu, e o céu é o que nega a terra, Niestzsche começa a atacar a compreensão do que é o bem e o mal. Em algum momento (não lembro quando), ele se diz uma dinamite e se propõe a demolir toda moral.

O ser amoral que ele propõe, ou que eu vejo ele propondo, não é o ser que se sobrepõe aos outros seres em nome de uma vontade superior. Essa vontade seria a vontade de Deus, mas que ele nega. Portanto sobrepuljar a si próprio ante os outros não é diferente de querer ser outro homem bom, ou um homem melhor.

A proposta do super-homem, portanto, seria uma desvinculação dessa vontade de superioridade. Não sou perito e não posso discorrer a respeito da vontade de potência. Mas compreendi essa ideia quando comecei a ler o Heroi de Mil Faces do Campbell. Essa obra tem muito a ver com Assim Falou Zaratustra.

Apesar de uma tratar de mitos religiosos e a outra tratar-se de um messias arreligioso e amoral, ambos tratam do retorno do ser mudado, transformado, do espírito libertado ao meio que foi responsável pela forja de suas algemas. No fundo, o que ele *prega*, é um reencontro com a terra, um tratado de paz com o corpo e com a humanidade.

Portanto o superhomem sempre perderia porque a briga, a conquista e a superioridade são características do homem que *devemos* superar.

224,2020-05-20 15:01:09+00:00,"Had a complete bowel obstruction that required emergency surgery, tore my intestine wall, and had me septic- it was absolutely,hands down, the worst pain of my entire life. 

I have Crohn's disease and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. 

This happened at the height of the opiod epidemic in Florida. 

I take extended release Morphine and, at the time, oxycodone, to deal with the pain of having dozens and dozens of joint dislocations non-stop. My hips tear out of the socket endlessly- it's very painful. The extended release morphine and breakthrough meds help- they allow me to walk, to eat, to function- but they do cause g.i. slowdown. 

This was not a problem until I had swelling from a crohns flare. One of the main problems caused by Ehlers Danlos Syndrome is faulty connective tissue- this doesn't just make your JOINTS extremely loose and overly flexible... It also affects anything with connective tissue... Like your colon and intestines. 

So the swelling, the gi slowdown from the meds- I started with a small blockage. My colon stretched. And stretched. And stretched. Nothing was passing, and I didn't realize it was an emergency- I just thought I hadn't pooped in a couple days. 

But see- I was in Florida to see my former sheriff supervisor's retirement... I was with my husband of just 9 months and our young son. We were sharing a small hotel room - we were doing much more, eating much more than I usually did... And I was taking more breakthrough meds as a result of my pain being increased- all of this was the PERFECT storm.

I woke up in my hotel during a trip to Florida thinking I needed to go to the bathroom.. It was 430am and my first thought was ""oh good. I can use the bathroom while everyone else is asleep"" (I can't help it- Im the type that doesn't even use public restrooms!) To my surprise- despite some pretty intense pressure to go... NOTHING happened. No gas.. nothing. 

Within 30 minutes, the pain was so intense,I could barely hold myself upright. Not even the smallest air bubble would move- my intestines felt like they were 10 times the size they should be. (Turns out my colon WAS actually WELL beyond normal). 
 
I could barely scream out to wake my husband- I told him to call an ambulance immediately. I had to pull my pants back up- and to ride to the ER, desperate to go - I thought that id get to the ER- they would give me some medication, and I'd be able to go... Instead, I got there, and was treated like absolute garbage. 

The ER doctor just outside my room, told my nurse ""white female, early 30's with OIC? Just let her sit in the restroom for a few hours. She'll never do this to herself again.""

He saw opiods on my chart- didn't bother to even look into WHY I was on them- he just assumed I was a junkie suffering opiod enduced constipation- and that since it was ""my own fault""- he'd let me just suffer. They didn't give me anything but fluids- and they made me sit on the hallway/ER toilet- with the door unlocked so they could check on me- but this also means people opening the door and SEEING ME in absolute agony, for over an hour. The pain was so bad that I wanted to die. The doctor's only words to me in the first few hours were an offer to do ""manual disimpaction"". All humility goes out the window when you're in such severe pain. I didn't care what he did- I just knew I couldn't live much longer...I was blacking out from the pain and they wouldn't give me anything because, they said- it would just make the sortation worse. 

I began throwing up- I felt like someone was digging through my abdomen with an ice pick and rusty spoons- finally my husband was able to get my specialist back home in NJ on the phone (it was early morning on a Sunday). My pain management doctor called the ER, Got the doctor on the phone and told him that I was very likely going to have a rupture and die- and explained my genetic condition. My husband overhead my specialist tearing into the ER doctor about his total disregard for me simply because I was on pain medication- and, my specialist told the ER doctor that he hopes I'd sue him personally for malpractice- and that he'll absolutely fly to Florida to testify. 

Within minutes, the ER doctor, a GI consult and a surgeon rushed me into surgery. My husband was told that I was VERY LUCKY to have had the timing that my doctor had- if I hadn't been cut down when I was- I may not have survived. 

I'm STILL angry about that f'n ER doctor and how dismissive he was of me- all because, in his eyes, I deserved to die a painful death I guess, since I was ""just a junkie"" anyway. He couldn't have cared less to know WHY I take morphine every 12 hours. 

I wouldn't wish that pain on almost anyone. It was 1,000 times worse than a broken jaw, my x section, my shattered knee cap and a multitude of other injuries. 


Anyway- I tell my story specifically to make people aware of a VERY real and serious problem in medicine; 

The treatment of chronic pain patients by doctors should be scary to everyone- after all-  one day you too could be in pain 24/7. The way we are ignored, dismissed, misdiagnosed, talked down to, treated as if we are nothing but liars and less than human .. it's vile. And most recently- most of us have had our pain medications stopped entirely or at least, cut down severely... 

All because of addicts overdosing on illegal &amp; dangerous fake fentynyl. Chronic long term pain patients - even cancer patients- are finding themselves limited by CDC dosage guidelines that were NEVER meant for pain management physicians- and we're being  denied adequate pain management - and in many cases- ANY pain management at all. People with chronic conditions are resorting to illegal street drugs or suicide out of despiration. 

Things need to get better and fast. We all deserve better. Chronic Pain patients are easily silenced since, without medication, we're all dead or stuck at home suffering. So please- make others aware of this serious epidemic. Pain should be treated - and pain patients should be treated with respect, not abuse and distrust. :-/",1

229,2020-05-20 06:03:50+00:00," [A entrevista do empresário Paulo Marinho à colunista Mônica Bergamo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/pf-antecipou-a-flavio-bolsonaro-que-queiroz-seria-alvo-de-operacao-diz-suplente-do-senador.shtml) recolocou no centro da mesa a mesma pergunta: por que o presidente Jair Bolsonaro demitiu seu chevalier servant, o ex-PM Fabrício Queiroz, no dia 15 de outubro de 2018, uma semana depois do primeiro turno da eleição e duas semanas antes do segundo? 

 No mesmo lance, dispensou também a filha de Queiroz. Se eles fizeram algo de errado, nunca se soube. Ela ganhava R$ 10 mil mensais no gabinete do então deputado Jair Bolsonaro e ele recebia R$ 9.000 servindo ao seu filho Flávio, que acabara de ser eleito senador.

 [Desde os primeiros dias do governo de Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/bolsonaro-diz-que-ex-aliado-tera-que-provar-acusacao-de-vazamento-de-operacao-da-pf.shtml) conhecem-se as movimentações financeiras de Queiroz. 

 Ele nunca explicou suas operações, limitando-se a dizer que ""fazia dinheiro"" comprando e vendendo carros. Queiroz empregou no gabinete de Flávio Bolsonaro a mãe do[ ex-PM e miliciano da ativa Adriano da Nóbrega](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/heroi-para-bolsonaro-ex-capitao-acumulava-punicoes-da-pm-quando-homenageado.shtml), foragido da Justiça por quase dois anos até que foi morto pela polícia baiana em fevereiro passado.

 Paulo Marinho é suplente do senador Bolsonaro e revelou que os Queiroz foram demitidos dias depois do cinematográfico encontro de três colaboradores de Flávio Bolsonaro com um delegado da Polícia Federal na segunda semana de outubro de 2018. 

 Ele teria revelado que uma investigação apontava para traficâncias de Queiroz. Dias depois, ele e sua filha foram demitidos. O alerta teria mobilizado os Bolsonaros, Marinho, o futuro ministro Gustavo Bebianno e três advogados. O ex-PM assustou-se, temendo ir para a cadeia, chegou a vomitar no banheiro de um escritório e desapareceu.

  Quando o Ministério Público investigava suas atividades, Queiroz queixou-se da falta de ajuda, sentindo-se ameaçado. Achava que os procuradores tinham um objeto ""do tamanho de um cometa para enterrar na gente"".

 O que seria uma história de 2018 [juntou-se a uma encrenca de hoje, com a denúncia do ex-ministro Sergio Moro de que Bolsonaro tentou interferir no trabalho da PF do Rio de Janeiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/05/suposto-vazamento-da-pf-ainda-na-eleicao-e-entrave-para-denuncia-de-bolsonaro-entenda.shtml), onde havia servido o delegado Alexandre Ramagem. Ele cuidou da Operação Cadeia Velha, que investigava malfeitorias na Assembleia Legislativa.

 Tudo voltou ao ponto de partida: a Superintendência da Polícia Federal do Rio de Janeiro. Bebianno morreu e Flávio Bolsonaro desqualifica as revelações de seu suplente, mas Marinho colocou na roda pessoas que discutiram a estratégia de defesa de Queiroz. Algumas delas teriam presenciado a conversa com o delegado. Marinho não a presenciou.

 Só as investigações do Ministério Público e da PF poderão esclarecer essa questão, mas uma coisa é certa há mais de um ano: a demissão de Queiroz e de sua filha tem cheiro de vazamento.

 Paulo Marinho está no PSDB, alinhado com o governador João Doria e é pré-candidato a prefeito do Rio.   
 Durante a campanha abrigou em sua casa do Jardim Botânico o quartel-general do candidato. Lá realizavam-se gravações e reuniões da equipe de Bolsonaro. Nessa relação estreita ele ganhou a suplência do senador Flávio Bolsonaro e perdeu uma cozinheira de várias décadas, levada pelo presidente para Brasília.",1

While alcohol is an extremely dangerous drug and has a therapeutic index more narrow than morphine or fantanyl (relative to threshold doses of course, I’m not saying it’s harder to overdose on fentanyl than alcohol... but if it were diluted in a bottle where 1 shot was equal to a single average dose the way an alcoholic beverage is, it would... especially if it tasted as shitty) but ecstasy is one of the few recreational drugs that would cause even more serious brain damage to people who routinely abused it like alcohol than alcohol itself.  Alcohol is a neurotoxin, one of few drugs of abuse with a neurotoxicity that is independent of overdose (heroin is a neurotoxin if you stop breathing... not normal without an overdose, same with benzos).  Stimulants like cocaine and amphetamine are not inherently toxic at lower recreational doses, in fact, even methamphetamine is not particularly toxic at lower doses (at higher doses it is neurotoxic and a nasty one at that, but lower and it’s a “safe” and at one point widely prescribed stimulant that often presents with less negative side effects than something like methylphenidate, of course it’s abuse potential makes it extremely dangerous).

Ecstasy (MDMA I should say) is methamphetamine with a modified group which allows the molecule to activate similar serotonin receptors as hallucinations like LSD as well as do what methamphetamine does which is stimulate dopamine and norepinephrine releases as well as inhibit reuptake.  MDMA on its own and in reasonable doses is likely not particularly toxic, however, a major metabolite of the drug is much more toxic (all though it is dependent on things like temperature and other factors).  If abused at high doses and frequently (like weekend drinking is done) I believe the evidence is more than sufficient to expect a decline in cognition in a way most people would probably really like to avoid.

Once in a while and especially for therapeutic purposes I think MDMA shows a vast potential, but claims that it is less harmful to have people abusing MDMA recreationally in similar regular intervals as alcohol is abused does not have much evidence to stand on.  While ethanol is nasty, MDMA can be as well, and it shouldn’t be thought of as a safer alternative.  At least until we know a lot more about long term effects and chronic effects.  Which is a major reason why we need to facilitate research on schedule 1 narcotics.

I do agree that alcohol is more addictive than either LSD or MDMA.

Everything else (including the ~2003 articles that report on the original seretonergic neuron degeneration following MDMA exposure, which I agree with the earlier source are likely rather harsh and that infrequent recreational use of reasonable doses is not going to noticeable inhibit ones ability to feel happy in the long run.",1
244,2020-05-19 17:17:34+00:00,"I’m a pharmacologist, toxicologist, and I think that this post is a it misleading in that the primary reason that MDMA might be safer than ethanol is  because people underestimate how dangerous ethanol is.  LSD I’ll back as inarguably safer than ethanol when taking all factors into consideration but the research on MDMA still suggests that it (like alcohol) is one of few drugs in which any use is neurotoxic.  As someone whose passed doctoral comprehensive exams focused on pharmacological research and drug development as well as someone whose curiosity has led him to experiment with just about every family of psychoactive drugs at one point or another I consider MDMA to be the drug that infrequent usage and lower doses of is probably the most important due to the potential for neurotoxicity in areas that are very important for long term happiness and function.  I think that the jury is still out on whether this is overcautious or not, but either way, it’s a bad idea, with current research, to consider weekly use of recreational doses of MDMA.

284,2020-05-17 13:19:00+00:00,"He probably first took opioids around that age. Most people don't just start on fentanyl (or more accurately almost no one ever intentionally does fentanyl). Most people get addicted to vicoden, oxycotin, percocet, etc. then when they don't have access to those drugs they turn to unregulated drugs like heroin. Heroin is often cut with different substances. Some more toxic than others. Fentanyl has been a pretty bad one because it only takes a very small amount to kill someone. It's very unlikely that his intention was ever to use fentanyl. ""Fentanyl overdose"" has been more and more commonly used lately because it helps to move the blame from US pharmaceutical companies that created the addiction to a substance that's being imported into the US from China.",1

Ya te recomendaron Pappo. Pappo blues vol I, II y III son una trilogía que hay que escuchar si o sí del rock argentino.

Durante la última dictadura militar 1976/1983 el rock sufre una fuerte censura. Si bien muchos artistas se quedaron tuvieron varios inconvenientes entonces las letras por ahí vienen camufladas con muchas sutilezas. No hay una oleada significativa de nuevos artistas.

En los 80 y con el final de la dictadura llega una nueva ola de influencias y se puede decir que hay una ""nueva oleada"" de estilos.

Does this apply to this analog as well? Can we make a 6-monobenzoyl derivative instead with increased potency?

Also, fuck acetic anhydride. Just take morphine with glacial acetic with a sulfuric acid catalyst, then you have 6-(mono)acetylmorphine which is 20% more active than heroin. It metabolizes into mostly morphine. This is better than heroin since it breaks down into both 3 and 6 acetylmorphines, so you are selectively getting the more active compound.

Also, do you have any knowledge on forming a potentially more lipid soluble and potent hydrogenated analogue of it? Hence the morphones vs morphines. Maybe add in some step to use a noble metal and hydrogen atmosphere to hydrogenate 7 and 8? Just a thought. Hopefully that’d be a more potent, more euphoric, and harder hitting derivative.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

313,2020-05-15 06:50:42+00:00,"Auch Zigaretten haben eine extrem hohe Suchtgefahr. Eine Sucht kann zwar kacke sein, ist an sich aber weniger schlimm. Soziale Degradation und Suizidrate entstehen auch erst durch die Kriminalisierung. Erstens wird es oft in psychischen Krisen konsumiert. D.h. z.b. bei Obdachlosigkeit u.ä.. Das hängt mit der Suizidrate zusammen, erzeugt sie aber nicht. Der andere Punkt entsteht durch die hohen Schwarzmarkt Preise und dadurch, dass du den ganzen Tag dich darum kümmern musst, Geld für den Stoff aufzutreiben. Bei Langzeitkonsumenten kommt es auch gar nicht mehr zu einem wirklichen Rausch.

Es gibt in DE 10 Heroin Ausgabestelle und die funktionieren alle super. Die Leute gehen ein mal Tag hin, kriegen das und den Rest des Tages können sie ihrem normalen Leben nachgehen.

Oder anders: Wieso führt eine Zigarettenabhängikeit nicht zum Suizid und sozialen Verfall? Und das wo Tabak deutlich schädlicher wäre als reines Heroin? 

Heroinabhängigkeit ist genau wie Tabakabhängigkeit scheiße. Die großen Unterschiede bei Konsumieren den und den Auswirkungen kommen aber nicht dadurch, dass Tabak weniger schädlich wäre oder man es seltener braucht (eher häufiger), sondern dadurch, dass es legal ist und erschwinglicher. Ansonsten könnte ein Heroinkonsument genau so gut funktionieren im Alltag wie ein Raucher. Und davon kennst du bestimmt einige.

Außerdem wird es nicht verharmlost. Es ist eine Erklärung wieso Heroin so gefährlich ist, denn das ist es. Das liegt aber nicht rein am Diamorphin.

This event was a party where the quarterback at a school who's BFFs with everyone dies from water poisoning. He took heroin for the first time in his life, and it was bad and made him thirsty, so he just kept drinking water and drinking water and drinking water until he collapsed.

Each book follows another person who knew him well like His cheerleader sister who gets hooked on OxyCotin to cope, the class nerd/loner who found his only real friend in this quarterback, and the secret girlfriend his parents didn't approve of. I can't remember who the fourth book is about. They were released around the time I was in grade 7 because I remember being in summer science camp reading one of them.

The story is told by a character identified as the ""Central Scrutinizer"" narrating the story of Joe, an average adolescent male, from LA, who forms a garage rock band, has unsatisfying relationships with women, gives all of his money to a government-assisted and insincere religion, explores sexual activities with appliances, and is imprisoned. After being released from prison into a dystopian society in which music itself has been criminalized, he lapses into insanity.""",1

mas pq? sem a mão esquerda do estado ainda tinhas trabalho infantil, horários de 14h, insegurança no trabalho, analfabetismo, doenças evitáveis, mortalidade infantil ... a lista é infindável... e determinante para o nível de riqueza de um povo. ou achas que é possível ter trabalhadores a produzir riqueza para accionistas parasitas se a maior parte desses trabalhadores não tiver onde cair morto ou não souber ler? O mercado, por si só, não cria riqueza alguma, apenas a distribui (e de forma injusta).

&gt;O preço a que foi conseguido o crescismento foram milhões salvos da pobreza e podia ter vindo muito mais cedo. 

diz isso a todos os que pereceram por miséria ou que vivem na abjecta pobreza. O preço são milhões de vidas perdidas ou estropiadas pelo mundo fora.

&gt;Se estás a dizer que estas pessoas não devem receber do estado estou contigo, 

não é o que estou a dizer. De resto, preocupa-te é com os accionistas que recebem **dos trabalhadores e do estado**, é sempre a sugar.

&gt;mas essas pessoas só conseguiram ficar assim ricas porque ofereceram às pessoas produtos e serviços que elas queriam mais do que o dinheiro na carteira.

ou então tinham capital social, cultural e económico para poderem tornar-se capitalistas, e assim enriquecer à conta do trabalho dos outros. E o meu ponto era o de que a riqueza que o capitalismo supostamente cria é ínfima quando comparada com a que pode ser criada noutro tipo de sistema que não canalize a riqueza produzida para os bolsos de meia dúzia de accionistas. Chegaste a ver aquele indicador que referi sobre riqueza representada à escala?

&gt; Mostra-me as linhas a não desaparecerem num mercado livre. 

Tipo, vais dizer que a pobreza acabou? Repara, o meu ponto não é o de que o capitalismo não cria riqueza nenhuma, mas sim que o preço dessa riqueza vem da miséria de incontáveis pessoas que, por não terem dinheiro, não têm direitos na prática. As linhas, enquanto não desaparecem, custam milhões de vidas. E podiam desaparecer num ápice, mas a economia de mercado tem outras prioridades: o lucro de accionistas.

&gt;É importante invocar estas pessoas 

neste contexto? LOL repara como não tens quase nada a dizer sobre a proposta. E o problema não é falar do gajo A ou B. Estou sempre pronto a isso, como aliás ainda estou aqui a fazer. O problema é usar isso como forma de impedir as críticas à economia de mercado, e sempre de forma superficial, como um credo memorizado.

&gt;para que se lebrem do que o vosso  sistema faz, mas pronto talvez tenhass menos comichão se invocar o  presente. 

invoca quem quiseres, já estou habituado à vossa feitiçaria e tigres de papel

&gt;O problema do teu sistema é que ninguém ganha excepto Kim,  Maduro, Al-Assad, Putin, Xi Jinping, Ortega, Díaz-Canel, etc. 

diz isso aos milhões e milhões de pessoas que passaram a saber ler e escrever, têm casa própria, comida, acesso a saúde, planeamento familiar, lazer. Deves achar que a URSS ter chegado a segunda potência do mundo caiu do céu e não significava melhorias nenhumas.

&gt;Não reduz  nada a liberdade à dimensão da conta bancária, nem a qualquer outra  dimensão, no mercado livre há alternativas mais baratas, és livre de  seguir vocações que te tragam mais rendimentos, és livre para pedir  ajuda e as pessoas são livres para te ajudar. 

lol ""és livre para pedir ajuda"" é um novo baixo ideológico neste tipo de conversa. Repara, sem dinheiro... que liberdade tens na prática? Se não percebes a questão, envia-me o teu dinheiro todo para perceberes melhor o que estou a tentar dizer sobre liberdade e capital. Mais, sem a tal mão esquerda do estado, o mercado simplesmente não quer saber se podes ou não comprar determinado artigo, mesmo que seja essencial. E em última análise liberdade é mais do que poder escolher entre mcdonalds e pizza hut.

&gt;Ao contrário do teu  sistema que sim reduz a liberdade das pessoas à sua ideologia e que se  opuser morrem logo. 

Também vi esse filme mas sinceramente achei os atores fraquinhos

&gt;Mas são verdadeiros por isso é que não os contriastes. Ou não os percebestes?

&gt;O teu sistema só pode funcionar e mal com os  impostos que cobras aos ricos que são as pessoas que dizes ser  gananciosas, burgeois e malvadas.

pobres ricos ;(

&gt;Como já te mostrei antes graças ao mercado livre os salários  aumentaram e a pobreza diminui.

como já respondi antes, os salários sobem graças à mobilização dos trabalhadores e sempre com a resistência violenta da classe dominante.

&gt;O teu sistema  implementa uma solução única e espera que sirva toda a gente de igual  forma, quando isso não acontece as pessoas sofrem, de fome na maior  parte das vezes, e executam os ""culpados"", para implementar a tal  solução precisaram de controlo através de poder centralizado.

Repara como podes ter, por exemplo, um SNS e mesmo assim garantir que cada um recebe o tratamento apropriado, ou que há médicos de diferentes especialidades, ou exames adequados a cada caso, etc... Achares que toda a gente recebe o mesmo tratamento apenas porque um serviço é público é apenas ridículo, como se houvesse apenas uma solução igual para todos. Benuron para toda a gente!1! E quem teve de ser executado para criar o SNS? Não percebo porque falas em execuções no contexto da notícia que estamos a comentar, como se não pudesse ser implementada de outra forma.

&gt;Quem começou com o comunismo foste tu ao defender a tabelação de preços e  atacar o mercado livre por não se importar com as pessoas. 

nunca falei em comunismo a não ser depois de teres introduzido o tema. Isso porque não conseguias falar apenas de preços ou da economia de mercado ou da proposta.

&gt;Fi-lo na  esperança que as minhas descrições factuais e corretas iluminem quem tem  um cérebro e não é um obsecado por controlo. 

ok, fica registada a intenção.

&gt;Mas sabes ler? Uma constituição que limita os abusos de uma democracia  não é apoiar regimes facistas, 

LOL poesia de novo? Entretanto vais dizer que o Salazar nem era fascista coitado ;(

&gt;aliás muitas democracias têm sistemas  para prevenir isso como, por exemplo, não existir democracia direta.  

pois, mas sabes bem que não é disso que se trata ali ;) É mesmo de achar que a democracia é perigosa. O teu amigo é um elitista, nunca te esqueças disso.

&gt;Também não é suportar regimes facistas ao ser nomeado presidente do *think tank* que transformou o país numa economia de mercado livre. 

não, é só gostar um bocadinho do Salazar ou do Pinochet

&gt;Ele não é o meu heroi só o referi porque acho que tinha literatura  relevante ao tema que estava a ser discutido, mas também não está errado  sobre isso. 

só falta dizeres que também acreditas no marxismo cultural e que a onu é um dos seus instrumentos. Depois partilhas um vídeo do Alex Jones que tb não é teu herói.

&gt;Como já te disseram essas idieologias são opostas uma à  outra os facistas desprezam os liberais e os liberais desprezam os  facistas. 

Como já respondi: como podem ser opostas se são ambas versões de capitalismo? Juro que curtia perceber. Na verdade, esse desprezo entre liberais e fascistas rapidamente desaparece em nome do inimigo comum: a esquerda. Respondo à segunda parte amanhã. Abraços",1

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution.

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

&gt;You imply some assumptions. 

&gt;1. That physicians are incapable of making appropriate decisions in caring for patients if provided a tiny piece of inaccurate and unreliable information- an absolutely preposterous suggestion. Physicians are licensed to practice because of their capability of making constant and accurate reassessments on the appropriateness if interventions and make necessary adjustments. They do so a thousand times a day and have done so millions of times in their careers. 


First, I am not a doctor, an I understand they go through extraordinary training. Training designed to cull those unfit for the profession. I. Very grateful I can rely on the experience and expertise you and your compatriots have.
I also realize that doctors are human, and subject to the same flaws as other humans.  

This opinion assumes that doctors are immune to advertising in general and that the drug marketing is in good faith, both of which are not true. You call marketing lies as tiny inaccuracies or unreliable info, Perdue said oxycotin and similar drugs were non-addictive, safe to be used cure all for pain, and marketed it that way. Would you still call that info a tiny thing? Or do you think if a drug rep told you that you could have gleaned that all of the official info about drug safety from the manufacturer was wrong and that's okay?


&gt;No one ever did anything consistently forever because a drug rep told them it is okay despite what they see in outcomes.

How about we don't make it where we have to poison patients to dissern marketing from reality. As the opioid crisis has proven, once doctors figured out they were lied to repeatedly, they changed their behavior. Purdue knew that they were selling a false bill of goods and killed people. Those people would not be dead if Perdue wasn't allowed to advertise. 

&gt;2. That interactions with pharmaceutical sales representatives accounting for a miniscule fraction of one percent of professional time have some profound effect on whether or not opiates are prescribed- they don’t. The marketing isn’t about whether or not to prescribe the drug appropriate to the treatment plan, it’s whose drug to prescribe and why. 

Get me a source proving that, here is a source proving my point. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622774/

&gt;It’s clear from all your statements that you have formulated a belief that opiate medication is fundamentally evil, harmful, and has no place in the treatment of humans. Yet all the evidence in the world exists to refute that, which is why opiates are used appropriately all the time. I’m sure you have friends that believe firearms are also fundamentally evil and should be banned for the same reasons. 

Absolutely wrong, no object in inherently evil, it's all to do with how it's used,  Opioids have been used in medicine in some form before recorded history. It's dangers have been well documented. My issue is companies knowingly profiting from the deaths of people due to their lies. 

&gt;Is addiction a bad thing? Sure. Is self destruction a bad thing? Sure. Would the prohibition of opiate marketing have any meaningful effect in the prevalence of addiction and self destruction behavior patterns in the population? No they would likely not. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622774/

&gt;The simple fact of the matter is that while there are a few physicians out there that hand out opiate prescriptions like candy as a business model, the vast majority prescribe them as appropriate tools that they are extremely well informed about. No one can claim that they weren’t properly educated about opiates because opiate prescribing education and competence is required continuing education for every physician license renewal. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622774/

&gt;But it doesn’t matter how misinformed you are on this issue, or how much accurate information you are provided to the contrary. You’ve clearly taken this up as your standard to bear and aren’t going to change your belief about it one bit. I’m fine with that. We can disagree forever.
 
I'm not against opioids or opiates being used, so I think that might impact the conversation. If you are unwilling to continue the discussion that's fine. I sure would like your opinion on any of the scholarly sources I've cited that you claim are full of misinformation or see any sources to provide me accurate information, unless you think I should just believe the word of a random internet stranger over a scholarly source.  

 From where I'm sitting I've provided sources for my claims, not everyone was scholarly but you haven't refuted any claims there in. I'd love to evolve my understanding, but I'm not going to just take your word for it. I hope this post clarifies my objections.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

Training wise will be similar to other PTP coys as there’s a lesson plan to follow.  But treatment by commanders may differ, punishments and regimentation &amp; discipline may be stricter in a mono-intake coy compared to non-mono intake. PTP phase is mostly PT sessions (1-2 a day) with some route marches and technical handling. The high keys like field camp will only kick in during BMT phase, so just take this time to train up your physical fitness. Training will be progressive so not to worry, if you’re planing to go command school, try to get a pass during PTP and then a gold/silver during BMT phase. I was from a mono and although there were a few “gangsters/pai kia” the vast majority were decent and normal people. After PTP phase is over, your company might double in size with a new BMT intake as mono-intakes are often hybrid BMT-PTP. One good way to know is through your current section strength, a full section should be 16. Make friends and get along well with your peers, peer appraisal is also a determinant for command school. If you do end up going to command school there’s a chance of ending up in infantry pro term in OCS/SCS and being posted back to 1SIR to lead your fellow batch mates as a 2nd year commander after your current 1st year commanders ORD. If you don’t, you may be posted to 1SIR as a trooper after POP.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Me lembro de uma entrevista no programa do jô com um cara que fazia novelas para os povos árabes.

Ele disse que um dos personagens era para ser o vilão.

Então ele colocou o cara batendo na esposa e fazendo outros atos de malfeitoria.

Mas o produtor da novela ficou surpreso que a coisa mais vilanesca aos olhos do público, foi que o cara ""prometeu e não cumpriu"".

.

O que eu quero dizer é que eu acredito que seja verdade o que José Padilha disse. E acredito que o Padilha não fez uma boa leitura dos valores morais da população brasileira para poder fazer com que Capitão nascimento fosse de fato vilão, ao invés de anti heroi.

.

Pro povo de faculdade, é claro como o dia que o Capitão é vilão.

.

Pro povo da comunidade, isso pode variar.

.

Pro povo ""burguês"", capitão saiu como quase heroi.

.

O que que este personagem precisava fazer para ser odiado?

~~Fumar maconha?~~ cheirar cocaína?

Ser ateista? (se bem que ""põe na conta do papa"" não foi o suficiente para manchar a imagem do personagem)

Ser corrupto desde o início?

Vale notar que acontece coisa parecida com outros filmes como ""O Poderoso Chefão"". 

Talvez a questão é que o personagem é protagonista. Talvez tenha gente que pensa que o protagonista nunca pode ser o vilão

A questão é que, no anti-herói, a falta das virtudes clássicas serve para que nos aproximemos do personagem. Entender sua história é o que torna a figura fascinante. É o que apontam as fontes que consultei (vide [1](https://educacaopublica.cecierj.edu.br/artigos/19/31/heroi-anti-heroi-e-vilao-a-percepcao-critica-contextualizada-a-sala-de-aula), [2](https://edtl.fcsh.unl.pt/encyclopedia/anti-heroi/), [3](http://tede2.pucgoias.edu.br:8080/handle/tede/3730#preview-link0), [4](http://www.relici.org.br/index.php/relici/article/view/146/166)).

Na minha visão, o fato de Petyr não ter as virtudes clássicas não faz dele um anti-herói, tanto porque desconhecemos suas motivações, quanto porque quase todos os personagens de ASOIAF são espécies de anti-heróis.

Por outro lado, mesmo que seja difícil entender quem é o protagonista de ASOIAF no meio de tantos POVs, podemos ter alguma certeza que os personagens secundários, com certeza não são os protagonistas. E Petyr é o antagonista de diversos deles (Ned, Tyrion, Catelyn, Sansa, Arya e Cersei me vêm a mente).

O trabalho de ter vendido 4 dos jogadores chave da época anterior em 2017/2018 que nos fez perder o pentacampeonato ou no de trazer um camião de jogadores em vez de reforçar as posições mais carenciadas como um Defesa Central ou um Lateral Direito?

Tu tens noção que para uma cena destas ir para os tribunais é preciso dinheiro certo? É que de um lado tens um simples cidadão que deu a sua opinião como tu e eu e foi repreendido pelo próprio presimente da pior maneira possível, do outro tens um tipo que tem o dobro ou o triplo da capacidade de arranjar advogados que o tirem de lá e arquivem por completo o caso. E nem é preciso levar um caso destes a julgamento para dizer que foi um episódio LAMENTÁVEL e NEGRO na história do clube que jamais aconteceu com mais ninguém. Discordar com uma opinião é aceitável, passar à agressão física para além de abuso verbal é atravessar por completo a linha.

I have a couple of points to make about this. I'm not being very low-key right now, but I am in fact a bit of an amateur drug dealer. I'll honestly sell anything that I can get my hands on. (Never fetanyl I don't want to kill anybody) 

So typically I would never ever be in favor of ratting someone out who is doing this job. As far as I'm concerned the war on drugs is evil and drug dealers are just normal people trying to get by in life.

But the idea of trying to sell to recovering addicts in rehabilitation environments is so, so, seriously, deeply fucked up.

I don't even need to really elaborate on that. I'm sure these comments are full of that.

But the fact that she just brought that up in the first conversation with you is incredibly trashy and ignorant. This woman just discussed commiting a felony crime with a complete stranger. Even if I didn't want you to expose her, the absolute mind-blowing ignorance of that is just too much. You have a truly trailer-trash worker here who can't even keep her business to herself at all. 

She might have been joking. I think if you are going to tell your doctor you should at least have one more conversation about it with her, just to see if she's being serious. 

Also I think her boyfriend should run from the relationship. This girl is clearly telling everybody his business, even her mom. What an idiot. Goddamn",1

*Of note: I take one pound off because it will be used by DEA/State boys as sting bait in later ops. 

1. 260 lbs of meth. Depends on if it's powdered or crystal, but it can go as low as $3500/lb to $10,000/lb, which puts this stash alone at $1.3 million (assuming the purchaser tips, $5000/lb)

2. 13 lbs of cocaine. Again, depending on its composition and RP, a kilo is usually $10-15k/kilo, so assuming average + tip would round out to $75,000 ($12,500/kilo=$73,750 + $1,250 tip)

3. 29 lbs of heroin - now this one was interesting because he had both white (30lb) and brown(13.75lb) heroin. Breaks down to 13.65/6.25kg, which avg $1,638,000 (white) and $168,750 (brown) for $1.81 million w/tip

#Fentany Reagent Testing

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Hmmm, I don't think you will get very far googling either of those terms in relation to chanting.  Perhaps you mean **endorphins** and **oxytocin**?  nb Oxycontin is an opioid medication, not a hormone, easily confused I know, but a very important difference if you are researching/googling.



Here's some info from an old post of mine from about a year ago which I hope you will find helpful. 



 https://www.worldtribune.org/2017/06/why-chant-out-loud/ - extract from article in the World Tribune:



“Recent studies also show that those who sing—or, in our case, chant—are happier. While singing releases endorphins, associated with feelings of pleasure,[1] singing in a group is said to release oxytocin, which enhances feelings of trust and well-being toward others, and alleviates anxiety and stress.[2]]”




This is true and it's important to know how we are chemically altering our thinking when we chant. 



Unfortunately, the WT only informs about beneficial effects of inducing oxytocin release.  Sure it has feel-good effects, but for balance, *especially* if you are trying to avoid bias and faulty conclusions from your research, it is important to look at other views.



It seems that oxytocin isn’t just a feel-good hormone/neurotransmitter. Recent research shows that “oxytocin has a dark side — for example, it can spur envy and gloating, and also promote ethnocentrism, potentially fueling xenophobia, prejudice and violence. Now researchers find it might enhance lying that serves one’s group.”




This has serious implications for anyone who chants regularly in a group setting.

#Fentany Reagent Testing

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

They'll take molds of your teeth and effectively do a practice alignment of everything using molds.

You'll then get to have braces again! Yay!! (Said no one ever). Which will align all your teeth back to where they should be.  These will stay on after the surgery for quite some time to stop things moving.

The day of surgery is quite simple. But you'll definitely be nervous, and the anithatists will give you various injections to help you relax.
And you'll wake up, sore, but not in horible pain, and they'll probably start off giving you morphene. Which is amazing.  But that's only needed for the first couple of hours, then it's just Panadol basically.

512,2020-05-03 23:21:32+00:00,"Compreendo, mas acho que tens uma visão paternalista do resto do mundo. Já viajei e vivi em vários continentes, incluindo África, tanto lusófona ou anglófona, e sempre que vejo formas de pensar como essa não deixo de pensar que a síndrome do ""heroi branco"" continua acesa. Acredita-se de facto na Europa que os Europeus detêm o ceptro do poder capaz de dar vida, morte, civilização ou degredo ao resto do mundo.

No século XIX, formas de pensar como a que referes deram origem à tal missão civilizadora europeia. Os europeus não podiam só comercializar com África e deixar esses coitadinhos viverem sob condições não civilizadas, sem medicamentos, sem comboios, sem nada só porque os seus líderes não se abriam a esse desenvolvimento. O resultado foi a colonização em massa de África quando os donos do capital perceberam que podiam canalizar essa opinião pública de ajudar África e ao mesmo tempo lucrarem com isso.

Hoje em dia continua o mesmo discurso dos coitadinhos e da responsabilidade europeia em salvar o resto do mundo.

Cada povo tem de se governar e daí existir a auto-determinação dos povos consagrada na ONU. Não sou eu nem tu que podemos ir lá dizer como deviam fazer as coisas para pior ou para melhor.

Se cada povo se preocupar em garantir que o seu governo o representa e faz o melhor para ele esteja melhor o mundo melhoraria. África por exemplo sofre imenso com a sindrome de ajuda Europeia. Agências de caridade e fundos de cooperação financiam os regimes que geram a pobreza que os doadores desses fundos querem acabar.

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

#Fentany Reagent Testing

517,2020-05-03 20:14:48+00:00,"&gt; No, perro tienen tanto dinero que aguantaran un rato.

Yo esto lo dudo seriamente. Las grandes empresas, de absolutamente todo el mundo, desde las textiles, las aerolíneas, los cruceros, que son empresas que facturan del orden de (Iberia por ejemplo en 2019) 6 mil millones de dólares; absolutamente todo lo que se paralizó por las cuarentenas tanto en estados unidos como en europa, a la primera semana de ello ya estaban solicitando a los gobiernos rescates económicos so pena de irse a la quiebra. Todas estas son empresas con grandes reservas de dinero también (tienen que tenerlo para I+D, compra de nuevas naves...); pero que sencillamente, tienen gastos fijos altísimos que hacen que sea completamente inviable el que están meses sin funcionar.

Los carteles son similares, y teniendo ingresos claramente inferiores qeu los de una de estas empresas, pero tienen gastos fijos muy altos que implican que no pueden paralizar su actividad si deja de ingresar dinero.

&gt; Además la legalización no es una solución completa. Nisiquiera se pueden legalizar todas las drogas. Podrás legalizar la marihuana tal vez, pero cocaína, heroina Etc nunca.

Estás dejando que lo perfecto sea el enemigo de lo bueno. Primero que nada, todo es posible, si hay voluntad política para ello. Entiendo que legalizar la cocaína en Estados Unidos es inviable, pero es porque no es un país con la violencia que vive México (supongo que no tengo que darte estadísticas). Grandes problemas requieren grandes soluciones; y al fin y al cabo, la racionalización detrás de legalizar la marihuana aplica completamente a la cocaína, aunque sea una droga más ""fea"". Siguen siendo drogas que aunque tienen un componente destructivo en cuanto a la capacidad de adicción (aunqeu en mi opinión el ""lobby"" de la marihuana ha hecho un trabajo brillante al minimizar completamente este riesgo, lo mismo que los riesgos psiquiátricos que entraña, que en mi opinión son completamente equiparables en términos de desencadenante de trastornos psicóticos a los de la marihuana); **todo ello** mejoraría drásticamente bajo un panorama de legalización. Un panorama en el que dichas drogas circularían de forma legal (aunque no sin estigma), estaría garantizada su pureza (uno de los graves amenazantes para la salud de las drogas), cuya venta provocaría ingresos a las arcas públicas, y que para encima de todo convertirían, de la noche a la mañana, un negocio completamente ilegal y violento en uno legal. Las consecuencias de tener drogas disponibles en la sociedad ya las estamos pagando; y los experimentos en distintos países con la descriminalización han demostrado que hacerlo no los empeora, ni aumenta la tasa de consumo en general (aunque dicho panorama en mi opinión debería incluir sin ninguna duda un empuje importantísimo hacia la oferta de tratamiento psiquiátrico y de adicciones).

En ese sentido, con lo que ahora sabemos del alcohol, si no nos hubiese acompañado desde el principio de los tiempos, nos parecería una droga muchísimo más inmoral que las drogas, y es bastante más dañina intrínsecamente (no hablo de los daños que derivan de la marginalidad y la ilegalidad) que incluso la cocaína o la heroína.

Hay otras actividades reconocidas como intrínsecamente moralmente peores que este tipo de cosas, como los juegos de azar (casinos y tal), y sin embargo la mayoría de los países (Incluido méxico más recientemente) han comprendido los beneficios tanto fiscales como pragmáticos de introducirlos en el marco de la legalidad y regulación. No sé qué edad tengas ni si recuerdas cuando en México los casinos eran ilegales, ni cómo fue el debate social para legalizarlos y regularlos. Pero fue fuerte. Y ahora, unos 15 años después, a nadie le parece ni medio raro cuando pasa con el coche junto a uno de ellos. 

Creo que a veces la imposibilidad de proyectarnos hacia el futuro y evaluar la realidad de las consecuencias de tal y cual acción obstaculizan la voluntad política.",1
518,2020-05-03 19:24:09+00:00,"Yeeeah brother. First of all, brilliant job my man. You've decided to do a bit of independent research and buck the trend of your normal social conditioning. 

It all depends on what kinda person you are. 
There are a whole host of plant-based meat substitutes out there in a the big supermarkets - lots of which are delicious. Dive in and try whatever seems appealing. It's an exciting time to experiment with all the alternatives. The vegan cheeses are generally shit, so if I were you I'd try and ween yourself off cheese to begin with (I say 'ween' literally - all mammillian milk contains casein which the brain converts to Caseomorpheine, a morohine derivative which is slightly additive and designed to keep their young suckling the milk. Cheese has a much higher concentration of casein and as such, is more addictive than milk.. most people find it the hardest to give up because of this. Lactose intolerance is nature's way of weening the young off their mother's milk.. but the majority of us humans have chosen to subvert this). Basically, vegan cheese simply is not as satisfying, or as tasty. I'd recommend not even bothering with it until your taste buds have had a chance to readjust. When they do... 'violife parmesan', 'applewood smoked', Mozzaricella and scheese are half decent replacements to check out. Along with more artisanal nut cheeses that aren't as a accessible or cheap

On a real level, all the vegan replacement stuff is still heavily processed, laden with salt / sugar etc and, although it may be better for you than animal products, you're a calisthenics man so hopefully diet is important to you. 

So, I'd suggest grabbing a recipe book and learning how to make some delicious grub. Vegan food is genuinely delicious if you know what you're doing and stick in a little bit of effort. Decent recipe books are anything from Bosh, Thug Kitchen: Eat like you give a fuck (all the swearing gets a bit monotonous but the recipes are solid). There are plenty of others but those are my favourites. 

Beans, nuts and fresh vegetables are your new best friends... But encororpate then into tasty dishes and you'll genuinely love them. They are so bioavailable that your body will relish all the nutrients (and protein ) that they give you. 

If you are using protein based supplements for calisthenics then there's no issue here. Plenty of vegan protein powders. I also use TVP which is textured vegetable protein: kind of like beef mince, but loaded with 50gs protein per 100g. So useful.

A vegan diet has so many benefits, but as with everything, has some drawbacks. The main one being vitamin B12. You'll want to conciouslly buy fortified B12 foods and/take supplements. 2 teaspoons of marmite has half your daily RDA

That's all I'll say for now because this is too long. But if you want any specific info, gimme a shout. I love helping people make the switch

""kratom is by no means an *opioid or opiate.* An **opiate** is an alkaloid within papaver somniferum the opium poppy plant which contains a milk called opium when its dried. This milk contains morphine, codeine, Thebaine and papaverine. If its not derived from that plant it is not considered an opiate.

**Opioids** are *opiate derivatives* that are synthetically altered to be similar to morphine, and other opiates mostly made from Thebaine. Most notible opioid synthetics are hydromorphone, diacetalmorphine and oxymorphone as well as fentayl.

Kratom containes mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine which are agonists to mu, kappa and delta opioid receptor sites. Opiates and opioids are agonists to the same receptors but act completely different on them than kratoms 3 alkaloids which have agonism to those sites. Anyways opioids are not defined by their agonistic nature to the 3 types of opioid receptor sites. They are defined by where they are derived from.""

So, no. Your comparison of Kratom to morphine is absolutely invalid.

Some facts for you. An incredibly small amount of gun related violence in Canada comes from legally registered firearms and firearms owners (excluding self-inflicted injuries). And those that do are a byproduct of crime or theft. Most of the firearms used in criminal activity in Canada come from the United States. Not blaming the US for that, it’s just a fact. They are easy to obtain, and much less risk than trying to take them from a gun-owning Canadian. 

It is a lengthy and regulated progress in Canada to get your PAL (possession and acquisition license) let alone your RPAL (Restricted PAL, for handguns and short-barrel rifles/shotguns). Canadian gun owners are not the problem with firearms in Canada. CRIMINALS are. 

I believe that citizens of any nation have a right and responsibility to protect each other, and we cannot rely on Police alone. A major city near me is currently undergoing a serious Meth and Fentayl problem, causing violent crimes to soar in the past few years. The police cannot be relied upon solely to protect one’s family, although they do their best. Lethal defense measures are our final recourse—but guess what? Even as a legal firearms owner (PAL/RPAL/otherwise) it is against the law to point a firearm (loaded or unloaded) at another individual, period—let alone using one for self-defense. Mandatory jail sentences exist for such crimes. 

Canada does not need further restricted gun measures. What we need are MUCH STRICTER LAWS for firearms-related criminal acts.  Including the possession of an unlawful firearm. Especially the possession of an unlawful firearm from outside the country, or a firearm withou a serial number. 

In my opinion, our laws DONT DO ENOUGH to keep Canadians safe. They only PUNISH LAW ABIDING CIVILIANS, not criminals who misuse firearms or use them in the commission of a crime. 

Yes. There are fucktards in Canada (and UK and US) that simply don’t understand this problem. And to be completely blunt about it, the argument of “well why SHOULDN’T I be able to have them?!?” Isn’t a strong argument, though it’s a valid one. The real issue here is about the right to protect oneself and one’s family without becoming a criminal in the process—because you’re damn straight the criminal doesn’t give two fucks about what Justin Trudeau says on TV.

525,2020-05-03 13:03:05+00:00," O médico sanitarista Gonzalo Vecina Neto defendeu a instituição de uma [fila única para o atendimento de pacientes de ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/04/pesquisadores-defendem-fila-unica-de-leitos-publicos-e-privados-contra-coronavirus.shtml)[Covid-19](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/04/pesquisadores-defendem-fila-unica-de-leitos-publicos-e-privados-contra-coronavirus.shtml) em hospitais públicos e privados. Nas suas palavras: “Dói, mas tem que fazer. Porque se não brasileiros pobres vão morrer e brasileiros ricos vão se salvar. Não tem cabimento isso”.

 Ex-diretor da Agência de Vigilância Sanitária e ex-superintendente do hospital Sírio Libanês, Vecina tem autoridade para dizer o que disse. A fila única não é uma ideia só dele. Foi proposta no início de abril por grupos de estudo das universidades de São Paulo e Federal do Rio.

 Na quarta-feira (29), o presidente do Conselho Nacional de Saúde, Fernando Zasso Pigatto, enviou ao ministro Nelson Teich e aos secretários estaduais de Saúde sua Recomendação 26, para que assumam a coordenação “da alocação dos recursos assistenciais existentes, incluindo leitos hospitalares de propriedade de particulares, requisitando seu uso quando necessário, e regulando o acesso segundo as prioridades sanitárias de cada caso”.

 Por quê? Porque a rede privada tem 15.898 leitos de UTIs, com ociosidade de 50%, e a rede pública tem 14.876 e está a um passo do colapso.

 O ex-ministro [Luiz Henrique ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ministro-admite-que-avancou-sinal-e-bolsonaro-tenta-desconstruir-heroi-mandetta.shtml)[Mandett](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ministro-admite-que-avancou-sinal-e-bolsonaro-tenta-desconstruir-heroi-mandetta.shtml)[a](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ministro-admite-que-avancou-sinal-e-bolsonaro-tenta-desconstruir-heroi-mandetta.shtml) (ex-diretor de uma Unimed) jamais tocou no assunto. Seu sucessor, Nelson Teich (cuja indicação para a pasta foi cabalada por agentes do baronato) também não. Depois da recomendação do conselho, quatro guildas da medicina privada saíram do silêncio, condenaram a ideia e apresentaram quatro propostas alternativas. Uma delas, a testagem da população, é risível e duas são dilatórias (a construção de hospitais de campanha e a publicação de editais para a contratação de leitos e serviços). A quarta vem a ser boa ideia: a revitalização de leitos públicos. Poderia ter sido oferecida em março.

  Desde o início da epidemia os [barões da medicina privada](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/05/numero-de-pacientes-de-covid-19-volta-a-crescer-no-hospital-albert-einstein.shtml) mantiveram-se em virótico silêncio. Eles viviam no mundo encantado da saúde de grife, contratando médicos renomados como se fossem jogadores de futebol, inaugurando hospitais com hotelarias estreladas e atendendo clientes de planos de saúde bilionários. Veio a Covid-19, e descobriram-se num país com 40 milhões de invisíveis e 12 milhões de desempregados.

 Se o vírus tivesse sido enfrentado com a [energia da Nova Zelândia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/04/empatica-e-eficaz-jacinda-conduz-nova-zelandia-a-fase-mais-branda-de-restricoes.shtml), o silêncio teria sido eficaz. Como isso era impossível, acordaram no Brasil, com 90 mil infectados e mais de 6.000 mortos.

 A Agência Nacional de Saúde ofereceu aos planos de saúde acesso ao recursos de um fundo se elas aceitassem atender (até julho) clientes inadimplentes. Nem pensar. Dos 780 planos só 9 aderiram.

 O silêncio virótico provocou-lhes uma tosse com a recomendação do Conselho Nacional de Saúde. A fila única é um remédio com efeitos laterais tóxicos. Se a burocracia ficar encarregada de organizá-la, arrisca só ficar pronta em 2021. Ademais é discutível se uma pessoa que pagou caro pelo acesso a um hospital deve ficar atrás de alguém que não pagou. Na outra ponta dessa discussão, fica a frase de Vecina: “Brasileiros pobres vão morrer e brasileiros ricos vão se salvar”. Os números da epidemia mostram que o baronato precisa sair da toca.

 A Covid-19 jogou o sistema de saúde brasileiro na arapuca daquele navio cujo nome não deve ser pronunciado (com Leonardo DiCaprio estrelando o filme). O transatlântico tinha 2.200 passageiros, mas nos seus botes salva-vidas só cabiam 1.200 pessoas. 34% dos homens da primeira classe salvaram-se.  
 Na terceira classe, só 12%.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Ou seja, no fundo nao estao querendo estao defendendo China nao pela China mas sim pela oposicao Americana. Entao eles precisam acreditar que a China nao eh o monstro que eh pq sem tal crenca esses esquerdistas perdem todas suas esperancas contra os EUA e o capitalismo que os EUA representa.

Eh como uma auto defesa paicologica. E algo que comum e natural para todos nos. Exatamene igual pessoas que votaram no bolsonaro nao pelo Bolsonaro, mas sim pq Bolsonaro representava o fim da ""corrupcao do PT"". Ou seja, um ato mais como forma de ser contra o PT do que pelo Bolsonaro em si, um ato mais para ferrar com o PT antes de mais nada (tal como a defesa da China eh um ato mais para ferrar com os EUA antes de.mais nada). Ambos os casos sao atos nihilistas.

E por isso precisam se convencer sobre qualidades imaginarias de Bolsonaro para justificar tal voto contra o PT. Ou das qualidades imaginarias da China para justificar tal desejo de desempoderamento dos EUA.

Eh um sentimento imaturo de frustracao que vem da infancia quando nao superado na infancia, tal como uma crianca que sai chutando e quebrando tudo pq quer que do caos o pai ou a mae estabeleca uma ordem.

E criancas que tem tais espressoes de frustracoes reprimidas nao superam isso e creacem com tais sentimentos imaturos. E eh por isso que bater em crianca impedindo a expeessao de frustracao dela eh ruim para o desenvolvimento psicologico dela.

Quando a crianca ve que apesar da birra dela a vida continua, a rotina continua, a casa ainda esta em pe e o amor dos pais continua, a crianca supera tais frustracoes e cresce sem tal anceio de destruicao para com esperanca de um milagre ou um heroi autoritario que estabeleca ordem.

I am guessing that for oxy pills and other opiates, if Fentanyl is cheaper and the drugs are not made by a real legal manufacturer, you are pretty much guaranteed of get Fentnyl, not real oxycodone and the difference is that unless you OD, oxy is not known to damage the brain.

I am referencing when pain is being inflicted upon them or when they are being killed. They cannot fight back or run away as they do in the wild.

&gt;When you bring up some specific actions I can agree or disagree with them. I don't see it as good to tie up calves like you have mentioned, or any number of other particulars you can bring up. But as I said before, you seek to extend those particulars to the stopping of the entire process and I don't.

In my stating that you seem unreceptive, I meant that it is highly unproductive to the discussion to ignore what happens to the vast majority of animals, which is the topic of the conversation, not what happens to a select few in better circumstances as that does not adress the reality of the situation.

&gt;If this is what veganism seeks, the the logical extension of this would be choosing to reduce suffering by choosing to prevent any animals in domestication from breeding. Because if they don't exist, then they can't suffer.

You are right. What I more intended to get across in that definition can be attained if you add another word. ""The point of veganism is to reduce the **unnecessary** suffering and exploitation of animals as much as possible or practicable.""

I am not an antinatalist of any sort but I would see it as better to not have a creature born into certain intense suffering and injustice from which they have no chance of escape.

&gt;And they certainly wouldn't accept the reasonable account of what you consider to be the true meaning of the ideology. I get it that you don't want to be lumped in with such extremists, but they come along with the label of vegan

I totally agree and appreciate your understanding of that reality. This is why I don't tend to call myself a vegan in any typcal manner. I find many of them to be massively presumtuous and unreasonable, but I of course support their lack of using of animal products but that is about as far as my fondness for them goes in so many cases. My ideas and reasoning is rather alternative to that of most vegans, thus I can understand so many of your points but disagree with what they lead to.

&gt;It seems like the evil you see is the result of our overpopulation and reckless industrialization.

I think you're actually correct there and I had not seen myself like that before so I am thankful that you've pointed that out.

&gt;But if those are the problems I see, then trying to fight against people eating animals is just a distraction, like fighting the symptoms rather than the disease.

I agree with that in principle but it doesn't really apply properly to this situation. Every day, roughly 200 million land animals are killed and the majority of those suffer in life and in death. This is not the underlying issue but is urgent to address. Much like you give someone morphene if they are in excruciating pain until you can do surgery.

This remains the largest evil that we commit in terms of morality and destruction of the environment and nature's balance and needs to be addressed as soon as possible. If we fixed that, then all we'd be harming are ourselves, which can then be confronted as another responsibility. But I see hurting others as worse than hurting yourself. I'd stop a serial-killer from killing another innocent person before I'd help them stop cutting themselves.",1

Unfortunate that the only way to get ahead in capitalism is to get enough money to invest and become a capitalist yourself.

America has the same size population on welfare programs that Canada has for an entire population; which would be 35mil or 10% of American population. The capitalists take care of those that can’t take care of themselves already? In my opinion this is even too much and causes tons of negative social issues for little financial advantage for the poor. 
Also capitalism usually has fat fat poor people with tons of booze and drugs. The homeless people are either junkies or mentally ill. Fentanol and mental illness are a hell of thing. The poorest people in my town were poor because they were alcoholics and then they molested children. The government gave them tons of money and food stamps, and the guy was self employed, this is communism in a way no?

Govt being tied to business and people being greedy is inevitable given capitalism, I don't think it's people in general that are the problem. Money is power, and people with money use that power to get influence in society, media, politics, the economy, etc etc, so the world is essentially run by whichever capitalists make the most money.

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.
