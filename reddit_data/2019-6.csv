""I want them integrated in our communities to bring a bit of that courage to all of us; in our military, for they will undoubtedly be the last to flee from a challenge"" - yet they can't even take on cartels or work within their government to change? Why are they not in their own military or police if this is the argument you're making? This is ludicrous on its face.

""and in our nation, for they certainly fight for the right to be free, and can undoubtedly be described as the brave. "" - based on what? We have actually seen the opposite here, especially in countries with high Muslim populations practicing Sharia law which is not compatible with US western values of free speech and expression:

https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/

See: ""there are some countries in which *substantial* minorities think violence against civilians is at least sometimes justified. This view is particularly widespread among Muslims in the Palestinian territories (40%), Afghanistan (39%), Egypt (29%) and Bangladesh (26%)."" - this is 1 in 4 or 2 in 5 depending.

Are you saying this is a good thing? The opioid crisis affects real people and real Americans who are dying at record high rates.

There's a thousand more stories I can post of this but my point is that with unchecked illegal immigrants coming in (yes, mainly through Mexico) there's no way to know what they are bringing whether tons of drugs that can hook and kill millions or diseases. There's a reason for checkpoints and for inspections to protect our citizens and legal immigrants who came here following the laws.

Again, why do we care more about people coming here illegally and willing to break our laws rather than our own citizens who need help? 

I'm glad that we are at least both willing to agree that our country is awesome enough that people are trying to get here, however, and that you're not just calling the USA an evil country.

12,2019-06-29 21:34:36+00:00,"The nobles in Erid Dania are split between Athairi and Danian lineages (though there's been a lot of intermarrying over the centuries, particularly amongst the nobility where such marriages have political advantage, so in some ways the distinction is almost moot amongst the nobles--which chauvinists on either side would undoubtedly point out). The nominally Athairi lineages hold An-Athair, Har An-Athair, Dain An-Athair, Heer, and Abeuth; Danian lineages hold Erid More, Uthmark, and Blackstone (and the Erid Kingship, along with the city of Westmark, which is mostly Danian); so they are about even, with an edge going to the Danians with the royal seat. Orphin, the so-called Bull of An-Athair, could be considered the unofficial ""king"" of the Athairi, a sort of first-among-equals sort of thing; he's the guy the Athairi lords and knights look to first to set the tone and a response. There is certainly some occasional tension between the two peoples, much of it centered on the question of practicing the Old Religion, but the Erid King, Eolred, has been careful to cultivate the Athairi lords as loyal vassals and has signaled to his Patriarch and the temple hierarchy that he is not interested in enforcing Divine King laws regarding idolatry and heresy. The closest recent breaking point was during the witch burnings that claimed Artesia's mother, when the Athairi lords felt King Eolred did not sufficiently protest the actions of Inquisitors from Therapoli (who led the witch burnings) to the High King and the Patriarch of Therapoli (the Patriarch of Erid Dania also came in for considerable criticism for lending some aid to the Therapolites in seeming defiance of the Erid King's preferences). But that has dropped to a simmer in the years since. Under normal circumstances discreet worship of the Old Religion is tolerated (in the woods it's pretty open). Some of this was covered in the Witch's Price adventure in the RPG (look for the side bar ""Orresto's Suspicions"" which describes an exception to that general rule, in the High Priest Efruse and his agents, who work to uncover and punish worshippers of the Old Religion). Under normal circumstances Eolred is far more likely to have problems with the city of Westmark, which routinely exerts its prerogatives as a Free City in defiance of his requests for taxes, than he does with the Athairi lords.",3

14,2019-06-29 21:02:12+00:00," Pressionado pela [divulgação de mensagens da época em que atuava na Operação Lava Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/entenda-vazamento-de-conversa-entre-moro-e-deltan-e-impacto-para-a-lava-jato.shtml), o ministro Sergio Moro (Justiça) recebeu afago do governador João Doria (PSDB), que [entregou a ele a principal honraria do estado de São Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/moro-reclama-de-ataques-e-fala-em-revanchismo-ao-receber-premio-de-doria.shtml) nesta sexta-feira (28).

 Ao receber a Ordem do Mérito, o ex-juiz reclamou dos ""vários ataques"" que vem sofrendo e criticou ""um certo revanchismo"", referindo-se aos questionamentos à sua imparcialidade no julgamento de processos como o do ex-presidente Lula (PT).

 O gesto de Doria contrasta com a postura ambígua do presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PSL), que [demorou quatro dias para se pronunciar em defesa de Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/bolsonaro-quebra-silencio-sobre-moro-minimiza-mensagens-e-diz-que-legado-dele-nao-tem-preco.shtml) quando as primeiras mensagens foram publicadas e, depois, [disse que ""não existe confiança 100%""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/nao-existe-confianca-100-afirma-bolsonaro-sobre-moro.shtml).

 O tucano [é apontado como candidato à Presidência em 2022](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/por-2022-doria-aposta-em-estilo-mais-discreto-em-comeco-de-governo.shtml), condição que foi reforçada nos últimos dias por declarações do atual ocupante do Planalto. Na cerimônia desta sexta, o governador não mencionou Bolsonaro, encerrando uma semana de desgaste na relação dos dois, por causa do[ imbróglio sobre a possível saída da Fórmula 1 de São Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/06/entenda-a-disputa-entre-rio-de-janeiro-e-sao-paulo-pela-f-1.shtml).

 Durante seu discurso no Palácio dos Bandeirantes, Moro classificou como ""um falso escândalo"" o episódio das [mensagens divulgadas inicialmente pelo site The Intercept Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/site-publica-mensagens-que-mostram-colaboracao-entre-moro-e-deltan-na-lava-jato.shtml). As conversas mostram proximidade entre o então juiz e procuradores do Ministério Público Federal que integravam a força-tarefa.

 Ele agradeceu à mulher, [Rosangela Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/12/1942120-mulher-de-moro-conta-com-ajuda-do-juiz-em-projeto-a-favor-de-apaes.shtml), que o acompanhava na solenidade, pelo suporte ao longo do período em que atuou na operação e agora, como ministro. ""Não tem sido muito fácil"", desabafou.

 ""Nas últimas três semanas, [tenho sofrido vários ataques](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/associacao-de-juizes-arquiva-representacao-que-pedia-exclusao-de-moro.shtml). Achei que a Operação Lava Jato tinha ficado para trás, mas um certo revanchismo às vezes reaparece"", disse o ministro, aludindo às conversas que vieram à tona em 9 de junho.

 Em sua fala, o membro da equipe de Bolsonaro também expressou gratidão ao presidente e afirmou que o superior ""tem prestado o seu apoio"" desde o início da crise provocada pelos vazamentos. Bolsonaro [repete que o ex-juiz é um patrimônio nacional](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/bolsonaro-diz-que-moro-e-patrimonio-nacional-e-que-nao-viu-nada-anormal-em-mensagens.shtml).

 Cercado de membros do governo e parlamentares, Doria usou o evento para exaltar Moro como símbolo do combate à corrupção, agradeceu pela contribuição dele na [transferência de líderes do PCC (Primeiro Comando da Capital) para presídios federais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/02/transferencia-de-presos-do-pcc-inclui-medidas-para-evitar-reacao-diz-doria.shtml) —a justificativa oficial para a homenagem— e atacou Lula.

 ""O Brasil precisa de mais Moros e menos Lulas"", discursou Doria, sob aplausos.

 Doria anunciou a intenção de dar a medalha a Moro no dia 14, [durante um jantar em sua homenagem no Rio de Janeiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/reduto-da-campanha-de-bolsonaro-vira-palanque-presidencial-para-doria.shtml). A decisão foi oficializada em um decreto assinado por ele três dias depois.

 Provável candidato à sucessão de Bolsonaro, o governador se apressou em fazer um aceno a Moro para reforçar o elo com seus potenciais eleitores em uma disputa nacional, na avaliação de aliados do tucano ouvidos pela **Folha**.

 O entendimento é o de que o apoiador de Doria é fundamentalmente antipetista e, por consequência, favorável ao [trabalho de Moro e da Lava Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/dialogos-entre-moro-e-lava-jato-tem-caminho-improvavel-para-autenticidade-entenda.shtml). Desde quando era prefeito da capital, o tucano busca antagonizar com o PT.

 Outro possível ganho embutido na aproximação é a nacionalização de sua imagem, lembram correligionários do tucano. Estar bem na foto com aquele que [detém a aura de herói](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/nelsondesa/2019/06/no-centro-de-escandalo-moro-vira-heroi-entre-aspas-para-wp.shtml) para uma parcela dos brasileiros pode se reverter em voto lá na frente.

 A tentativa de expandir sua imagem, ampliando a influência para além das fronteiras paulistas, pôde ser vista também no discurso que Doria fez ao entregar a comenda a Moro. Mais de uma vez, ele fez referência em sua fala ""aos brasileiros de São Paulo"".

 Tanto aliados quanto opositores não tiveram dúvida de que o gesto desta sexta é parte do cálculo político do tucano de olho em 2022. Ele frisou que a decisão foi um agradecimento a Moro pela parceria no episódio do PCC e um reconhecimento ao trabalho dele no combate ao crime.

 Publicamente, Doria desconversa quando questionado sobre o plano de tentar a Presidência.

 Nos últimos dias, Bolsonaro contribuiu para antecipar o calendário da sucessão. Ele [afirmou não descartar disputar a reeleição](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/la-na-frente-todos-votarao-em-mim-diz-bolsonaro-ao-indicar-disputa-pela-reeleicao.shtml) e passou a [dizer abertamente que vê Doria como candidato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/06/bolsonaro-diz-que-ha-99-chance-de-f-1-ir-para-o-rio-de-janeiro.shtml).

 Uma dessas manifestações foi feita em meio ao debate sobre a migração do GP Brasil de F-1 para o Rio, ideia que desagrada ao governador paulista.

 Doria [reagiu com ironia à fala do presidente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/06/doria-ironiza-f-1-no-rio-e-diz-so-de-cavalo-se-chega-a-deodoro.shtml) de que havia 99% de chances de a prova ser transferida para o Rio. Disse que ""só a cavalo"" é possível chegar a Deodoro, circuito que passaria a sediar a prova.

 Pessoas próximas ao tucano minimizam o impacto da rusga e dizem que o estresse entre os dois é momentâneo, por envolver uma disputa na qual ambos estão empenhados. Ninguém arrisca palpite, contudo, sobre o prazo de validade da [dobradinha ""BolsoDoria""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/dobradinha-bolsodoria-impulsiona-vitoria-de-tucano-no-governo-de-sp.shtml), que pautou o segundo turno de 2018 no estado.

 ### PT na mira

 Moro foi admitido no grau de grã-cruz (o mais elevado) da [Ordem do Ipiranga, honraria que foi criada em 1969](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/doria-dara-a-moro-medalha-que-ja-foi-entregue-a-citados-na-lava-jato.shtml). O título é usado por ocupantes do Bandeirantes para reverenciar artistas, políticos, empresários e personalidades que tenham prestado ""serviços de excepcional relevância"" ao estado e ao Brasil.

 Moro recebeu a faixa e a medalha que simbolizam o prêmio e posou para imagens segurando a mão do governador.

 Deputados do PT na Assembleia Legislativa [entraram com um projeto para tentar cassar a homenagem](https://painel.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/06/28/pt-quer-cassar-medalha-entregue-por-doria-a-moro/), argumentando que a condecoração a Moro não se encaixa nas regras previstas para a concessão da honraria. O pedido ainda não foi votado.

 Durante o evento desta sexta, Doria disparou várias vezes contra o partido do ex-presidente Lula.

 ""Não foi uma batalha pessoal de um contra o outro. Se houve uma causa na prisão de Lula, foi a causa da verdade contra a mentira. E, para o bem do Brasil, venceu a verdade, venceu o Brasil, venceu Sergio Moro"", disse.

 ""Se não fosse este homem, liderando um grupo de patriotas, com juízes, com desembargadores, com promotores, nós não teríamos a Lava Jato no Brasil, e não teríamos trancafiados em prisões aqueles que usurparam, roubaram e enganaram os brasileiros"", afirmou o governador.

 Ele disse também que ""o início de um esquema criminoso começou em São Paulo"" e recordou, sem citar Lula, que ""o tríplex"" e ""o sítio"" ficam no estado. O ex-presidente [foi condenado em processos relacionados aos dois imóveis, em Guarujá e em Atibaia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/alem-do-caso-do-sitio-lula-e-reu-em-outras-7-acoes-penais.shtml).

 ""Graças à Lava Jato, o Brasil está recuperando mais de R$ 13 bilhões desviados pela corrupção de governos petistas, de corrupção de governos do PT. É preciso deixar claro e consignado que foram governos petistas que contribuíram para assaltar os cofres públicos e roubar a consciência de brasileiros"", afirmou Doria.",1

Alcohol has probably been used to trick people since day one of getting drunk. Morphene has been used, opiates make most people pretty stupid/suggestable. Theres also LSD but that still leaves some people too stimulated to slip, some people can remain lucid on doses so high they can't see straight.  Its a not a stimulant but it definitely does the opposite of make you groggy.
What you really want is a tranquilizer, specifically a dopamine antagonist like quetiapine. You can take high doses of this and be conscious the whole time but your cognitive ability is like fax machine at that point and you can't really move. So theres no truth serum to be sure but when administered alongside regular torture sessions you can accomplish a goal.

Ancient Egyptians used honey and yogurt as a way to kill sperm and it’s just as effective as modern day medicine given that mixing that together creates a chemical reaction that makes lactic acid, the hormone that makes breast milk, however in modern medicine lactic acid is used as a spermicide. Most sperm die from either mucus lining in the womans cagina or the acidic climate and others just get lost. Even then on average only about 4% of sperm can actually swim in the first place. The rest are all malformed duds. Men can get a sperm count which can determine if they are infertile or not (basically the higher the percentage the more fertile they are). However given pee is also highly acidic, it can also be used as a spermicide. Pee is actually sterile which is why when you puss in cups at the hospital you don’t have to sterilize. The reason pee is sterile is because ABSOLUTELY NOTHING can survive there. So for an unethical pro life tip you can piss in a girl if you forgot your condom to not get her pregnant. r/UPLT",6

22,2019-06-29 13:55:47+00:00,"TL;DR: nekoliko situacija povezanih sa mafijašima devedesetih

Do moje sedme godine, živeli smo u malo većoj kući sa dvorištem u centru grada. Nismo bili sad neki  bogataši, nego je to imanje bilo u nasledstvu u mojoj porodici oko stotinak godina, a komunisti su odlučili da se promeni lokacija centra grada, i približili su ga našoj kući. Gazde kuća oko naše su bili *pritisnuti* od strane mafijaša, u toku devedesetih, da im prodaju svoje kuće i tu su oni rušili to i gradili sebi ogromne kućerde/vile (4 takva u krugu od 250 metara, svi u istoj ulici). Nas nisu mogli da pritisnu zato što je moj deda bio direktor najveće fabrike u gradu, pa smo imali veze.

Preko puta je živeo jedan od najvećih kriminalaca u tom periodu u jugoslaviji (ogroman broj firmi, šverc svega i svačega, uvek naoružan) sa porodicom, sa druge strane je živeo lik koji je švercovao ogromne količine heroina i druge narkotike u kući koju je on izgradio, a niz ulicu je živeo isto veliki krimos, zbog čijih pretnji smo se na kraju i odselili.

Bilo je tu više zanimljivih situacija, i teško ih je sve nabrojati, pa ću samo izdvojiti hajlajte.

Jedno jutro smo se probudili i u dvorištu nam je bio crni džip bez tablica sa punim prtljagom i zadnjim sedištem, nečeg (ne znamo jer mu niko nikad nije prišao da pogleda šta je unutra). To je bilo vrlo čudno, jer je naše dvorište imalo ogromnu čeličnu/gvozdenu ogradu koja je uvek bila zaključana. Tako je stajao džip u dvorištu dva ili tri dana, i niko mu nije prišao, jer devedesete. U toku noći smo čuli lupanje na vratima. Tata je uzeo pištolj i prišao, držeći pištolj iza leđa. Tu je bio naš komšija, narko diler sa nekoliko nabildovanih likova. Rekao je samo da je došao po svoj džip. Jedan lik je ušao da vozi džip, a moji su posmatrali kako su izlazili iz dvorišta. Naime, dva nabildovana lika bi stali sa različitih strana kapije ograde i bukvalno bi podigli celu čeličnu ogradu iz zemlje, da lepo prođe džip, pa su je vratili dole. Ta ograda je bila ekstremno teška, da moj otac sa kumovima nije uspeo ni da je pomeri kad je probao da rekreira to kasnije. Taj komšija je imao kuću bez prozora sa limenim zidom. Pored kuće je imao ""šupu"" od cigle. Sa vremena na vreme, neko bi izašao iz kuće i pod ciglu šupe stavio kesicu/paket narkotika, a mušterija bi se pojavila ubrzo i zamenila to sa novcem. Čovek je imao nadimak po određenoj hemikaliji koju je koristio, i retko je izlazio iz kuće, osim nedeljom, kad je najglasnije pevao u crkvi. Umro je, i sin mu je nasledio nadimak i kuću, samo što je on sitni diler i ozbiljan zavisnik koji je robijao. 

Onaj veliki bogataš prekoputa je bio ozbiljno paranoičan da će neko doći da ga rokne. Živeo je baš u strahu i tako je izgradio ogromnu vilu prekoputa naše kuće. Umro je rano od srčanog udara, pa je samo njegova porodica ostala tu. Imao je ćerku koja je mojih godina, i nas dve smo se stalno igrale zajedno, pa sam provela mnogo vremena u toj kući (bolje je pamtim od svoje kuće, a i nedavno sam bila tamo pa mi se osvežilo sećanje). Kao devojčici, nikad mi ništa tu nije delovalo čudno, što i sad prihvatam kao normalno, a trbalo je da mi bude čudno. Prvo, arhitekrura je ludilo. Kuća je najveća u kojoj sam ja u životu bila, 4 sprata + potkrovlje, po dva wc-a na spratu + poslovna zgrada pored i teretana ispod + ogromna garaža. Čovek je bio toliko paranoičan da će ga neko ubiti, da je celu kuću praktično ogradio svojim lokalima, pa tu još napravio i zid, i u kuću može da se uđe samo kroz mali prolaz koji gleda ka glavnoj ulici koji vodi u osrednje dvorište koje je potpuno zazidano okolo, osim ulaza za garažu koji je isto ograđen na neki način sa druge strane. To je verovatno jedna od najvećih vila u gradu, ali malo ljudi je i svesno da je tu jer je ulaz samo mala čelična vrata ka glavnoj ulici u gradu. Samo sa google mapsa se vidi lepo koliki je to ustvari prostori i kako je ograđena. Prvi je instalirao kamere u dvorište, i interfon na ta vrata sa kamerom, u vreme kad to niko nije imao. Iznutra je bruka. Sve je puno drvo, ogromne stepenice i tepisi od krzna. Mala ja sam potpuno normalno shvatila da oni imaju dva tepiha od kravljeg krzna i jedan od medveda. WTF.  Toliko je velika kuća, da porodica koja sad tu živi (6 članova), zimi živi samo na jednom spratu jer je nemoguće grejati toliku kuću, a 2 wc-a su im sasvim dovoljna. Smešna stvar je bila to što sam ja u dvorištu imala drveće, a ona u zazidanom dvorištu to nije imala, tako da nisu imali gde da joj okače ljuljašku, pa su nas zamolili da pored moje okače i njenu :D Jedna stvar koja je malo čudna je oltar gde je sve zlato i ikone, koji je veličine mog kupatila, u sred ogromne dnevne sobe. Taj lik je donirao ogromne pare SPC, i oni su mu dali neku mermernu zahvalnicu koja stoji u kući. Ne mogu zbog privatnosti tih ljudi da kažem kog hrama je on glavni pokrovitelj.

Treći krimos zbog koga smo se odselili je živeo u istoj ulici i silno je želeo naše imanje. Kad je moj deda poginuo, pojavio se za manje od 7 dana u kući i spontano naglasio mom ocu da mora da mu proda kuću, jer preko veze, on neće dozvoliti da se dobije dozvola da se nešto gradi na tom imanju, a ako prodamo kuću takvu kakva jeste nekom drugom, dobićemo frakciju novca koju vredi jer je kuća bila baš stara, a ako ostanemo, može nešto neželjeno da se desi. On je svog kuma ucenjivao i mučio, pa smo znali da je opasan, i nismo imali izbora. Snašli smo se tako što smo prodali kuću našim kumovima koji su bili još zajebaniji od tog lika i dobili su dozvolu za gradnju za nepunih mesec dana, preko veze. Tog lika je neko kasnije upucao u autu.

Bilo je tu još dosta stvari, na dnevnom nivou, koje su bile potpuno čudne, ali mi smo se nekako uvek pravili da je sve normalno, i da su te komšije normalne.",27

With a tolerance like that and assuming you’re not gonna shoot, you’re options are really fentanyl and oxymorphone (with the latter being far better on the euphoria front). 10 mg of snorted oxymorphone is approximately equal to somewhere around 60-80 mg of oral oxycodone. And, because oxymorphones oral bioavailability is shit, they make up to 40 mg tabs. Get your hands on a couple of those per day and you’ll be flying. I usually only insufflate around 3-5 mg of oxymorphone at a time, and last time I came across oxycodone, it took 60 mg just to feel it. 80 mg after a fatty meal equaled the 3 mg of insufflated oxymorphone. So, of course ymmv, but in my case, the bioavailability conversion between -morphone and -codone is even wider (in favor of -morphone) than the charts say.",1

 Meaning, grandpa dies of cancer with hospital deliverd pain meds in his system and his death goes on that opiod epidemic list! 

This is wrong. It's got to stop. Thank god for medical marijuana in states that have it as it does help. However,  the opioid medication tends to work the best for a lot of people.  Its not right.  Just because some people abuse something doesn't mean we can take it frome everyone!

The municipality has done a lot of work in many areas, but this really is not its jurisdiction.  Health care and social services are funded by the province.  Studies have shown that funding to social services will have a greater impact on health issues than funding to health services.  Maybe if we shifted some health care funding to social services 30 years ago much of this could have been reduced.

Further, there are the issues with the Federal government.  While not every person with opioid issues is Indigenous, the Indigenous population is over-representative.  Much has to do with the past few hundred years, but further, a lot of it has to do with responsibility.  If the Federal government is responsible for Indigenous people in Indigenous communities, then some of that money should follow the person when they change communities.

Then there is the whole blame on how we have handled the drug crisis.  Much of it goes to the funding models for methodone.  While suboxone is more effective, methodone has primarily failed because those running the clinic are paid per visit and thus have not followed the process of reduction.

And let's not forget oxycotin and how poorly it was sold to physicians and how much of it was poorly prescribed.

The blame can go on, but if we want to see improvements, a lot of groups will need to work together.",1

But yea, people are dependent on loads of drugs, whether that's blood pressure medication, antipsychotics, anti seizure meds, anti depressives or even just insulin.

If you instantly drop any of them there will be rebound effects that'll worsen their symptoms further than they ever were before the drug was started.

66,2019-06-26 14:55:16+00:00,"TLDR: my ex broke my heart too and I'm scared for the future without him alot of it is just his and my story. Without all the fun stuff we did together. Just a really rushed explanation of our story and a closing to our chapter of a relationship.

I'll jump on the bandwagon here. My partner who I've known for a year and a bit broke my heart in Friday. So the wounds aren't as fresh as yours but they're still barely healed if at all. If you need someone to talk to I can talk to you there's also a breakup discord it's a really nice place to rant.


I guess I should give my ex's( 22M) and my(23F) story. In April of 2018 my very first boyfriend ever broke my heart. I was distraught and wanting anything to stop the pain so after 3 week's I turned to tinder. This is where I met my current ex. We talked for a month or so just via text before we ever even decided to meet in person. We went on one date and he told me he was interested in pursuing the relationship further. I told him that after that date I wasn't even close to ready and that he should continue looking for his future girl. For some reason this idiot decided to stick around and become my best friend and biggest support system through that breakup. He was my rock. He brought up still being interested in me several times. I kept turning him down but now it was because I didn't wanna ruin our friendship. Well I finally caved in October/November of 2018. This is where we started exploring us as a couple. Everything seemed to be going great.


December and January he quit his job and I helped him out and he eventually found a new position. I'm currently in school full-time.


 In February I got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease this is where I expected him to run hell I thought I was dying. Turns out I may have the lesser version. Its called scleroderma for those reading this. They're thinking I have Morphea the generalized version and deep version. Till I know 100% it can still be the diffuse version and that Dan get really bad really fast. Anyways this isn't a story about my autoimmune disease. He hugged me and really helped me cope with my diagnosis and make me not feel ugly it really messed up the colour and texture in my leg and I feel hideous about it and am terrified to ever date in the future now.


 Anyway back to the actual story I ended up moving in February because my landlord was renting and illegal suite and I had 20 days to get out and no where to go. I told him it can be tempary but he wanted me to stay said he was happy and all. So we decided to stay living together. It was going well of course the odd bicker here or there as we discussed cleaning rituals. How we so things differently how to come to a compromise. He never really seemed to wanna back down because he's also has a chef background and clearly he's doing it right. Guess this was one of his problems.

Next was my finals we got through that which is always a super stressful time on top of that I was looking for my co-op position let's all be thankful now I landed a remote position. Since that really helps with the future of this story. 


Now for why did we breakup. We had just has sex the day before gone grocery shopping talked about our future camping trip and then going floating. For the four days before that I was on a trip for work and had gone on my first plane woot. Friday night after we both worked and I covered myself in hot ramen because apparently bad things happen in threes. I was laying naked in bed just drying out because meh works over why not chill. Ended up napping lol. He came and cuddled me told me I had a nice ass. About 30 min later he would come back and say in tears that he wants to move back home in January. This is where I would say okay we can do that I can get my co-op down there. I may have to come back and finish my classes for 8 mths but we can make it work travel the 4 hours and take turns. He just cried harder thou. So I had to ask the question are you breaking up with me. This is where be told me kinda. To me that could only mean yes but I needed to verify because kinda is not an answer. I wish now I would of asked about taking a break but no one really truly thinks logically in these things. So we cuddled and cried for awhile till his mom called and he went and took that call. I got dressed and we continued having the conversation. When the call was over. He said he didn't in anyway want an LDR this would be where i ask if he ever has thus is where I explain that it wouldnt really be that long of a time. That it's doable. He kept telling me no though his mind was made. He told me that when I was on my trip that he didn't think he missed me enough. That with his ex when she went on a trip he cried every night she was gone let's talk about codependent anyway I sure wasn't crying on my trip I missed him but that was that I still knew I was coming home to my boyfriend. He then said that he was very much in love with me but over the month of thinking of going home he felt he was no longer falling deeper in love with me that he jsut loved me. I tried to really understand and get answers but there was none to give. He also said he didn't want me to move with him that he made that mistake with his ex and regretted moving to our city. He also sat on the couch crying his eyes out begging me to be his friend I couldn't promise him that thou.


I called my mom and she got everything together so I could move out the next day. The night of the breakup we were gonna hold each other in bed but I couldn't stop crying so he went to the couch. I cried all night switching between the bed and the bathroom. He was crying too crying so hard he was puking. I kept thinking how is this the right choice if we're both in pain. That morning he hopped into his car and drove away. Apparently to go to therapy which there was to big of a waitlist so he couldn't get in. I texted him saying I thought I would atleast get to say goodbye. He eventually came home and I got to hug and say goodbye also make a fool of myself as I cried my eyes out begging that we could try and make it work. He then left to be with friends. I then had my parents arrive and help me pack up my life there to move back in with them. Packing while crying is really hard and I do not recommend. 


I got home that Saturday I kept texting him because again why not make a fool of myself. I wanted to be friends but I also wanted answers. I guess I was pulling every trick in ym book to try and make him consider taking me back. He didn't really to me till that night. Told me he was gonna be silent but in the future we could be friends. He told me he was depressed empty inside and lacked a purpose. That he was happier with me but that this was for the best. I would continue the next day not sleeping trying to talk to him trying to get a response making a fool of myself. 


That night I would change my tactic. I stopped acting like his heart broken ex but a friend I of course still have my slips in only human. I'm not sure if trying to be his friend is going to slow my healing down or not but I feel better being able to talk to my best friend. I guess I'll lose a boyfriend but not my best friend and I'm okay with that. 


I'm scared of the future without him in scared to take on this works alone. To graduate without him by my side. Hell if I end up moving to his city because there are great jobs down there I'm super worried to make that move alone. I'm 100% terrified. I'm scared to have to get roommate again roommates are always awful but I can't afford the rent on my own. I'm also crushed that the future I saw where we move to his hometown and we get a puppy and explore his city his gone.

68,2019-06-26 12:32:47+00:00,"I'm sorry, DARE is universally regarded as a horrible drug education program. Just like abstinence only sex ed, telling someone every drug will end up with you dead or homeless only leads to mistrust and an incomplete understanding of the real issues with drugs.

There might be other places to learn that testing and verifying the sources of drugs is a good idea, but the fact is that a visible physical presence in a place where many people are partaking in illicit drug use casts a much more focused and effective net than literally anything else. Sure, if you thought to Google the right terms (again, super difficult without an education on the subject) or were around in the heyday of bluelight you miiight learn why and how to test your drugs, but obviously kids are not doing that because more and more of them die every day from shitty adulterants like fetanyl and it's analogs. 

As for the goal of the protest, you're right, it is for visibility. It is to raise awareness around the organization and their message. I am not suggesting BP or DanceSafe are the right organizations that should be running harm reduction at festivals. Perhaps they are distorting the truth so that they can continue on trying to spread their message (not justified at all). What you have presented seems a little convoluted on their end, yet they are the only orgs out there on the ground trying to start a grassroots movement around a cause that literally saves lives.

What I am saying is if you remove their presence entirely, you have effectively cut off their most effective outreach method. In order to raise awareness, you need to have a presence in the community of those most effected by the issue you are trying to tackle. If the awareness reaches a critical mass, we can remove the messenger from the equation and have real structural change like in the places OP mentioned above.

If you have another solution, I'm all ears. But so far all I have heard is that you think they should be removed so people can keep partying at an escapist festival with no ties to the community (and undoubtedly with more unsafe drugs floating around). Until you propose a better solution I stand by saying that I would rather EF or any other fest get shut down before trying to remove the presence of people trying to save lives. 

I'm also not sure of the legality, but it is clear by the event rules that illicit substances are banned at EF. I'm not sure why allowing harm reduction to sell non-illicit substances is illegal. Is EF burying their head in the sand and allowing kids to OD on their grounds legally better? It sure as hell is morally worse. But then again, they've already proven they are all about the money anyway.",0

CO2 kills you just as well as CO.


The pill overdoses shown on TV are actually more dangerous in real life. Because many people use paracetamol/acetaminophen to do so.

And that is pretty vicious, because after the first 24 hours you'll feel much better, but are a walking dead, cause your liver is shot, and you'll slowly die within the next 5 to 7 days.

40+ pills of paracetamol is enough to do so, and is one of the worst ways to die.


Are you sure the morphine was was morphine and not a fake pill containing copious amounts of a fentanyl derivative? Because that's what's currently killing opioid users.

And even back in the heroin days, people would frequently overdose because instead of the shitty 5% heroin they normally got it suddenly was 20 or even 40% diamorphin by weight.",40
73,2019-06-26 07:53:22+00:00,"Kratom and Hydroxyzine were my first thought.

Salvia may work as well (CHEWED, NOT SMOKED).

Agmatine Sulfate, zinc, and magnesium for sure. 

Seriously, everyone underestimates zinc and magnesium, especially magnesium, because it's very effective.

Gabapentin is AMAZING along with opioids, and much safer than alternatives. It also goes VERY well with GABAergics like thienodiazepines. It may even make you wanna drop down a bit on your etizolam dosage.

It is amazing when paired with GABAergics and opioidergics, (&amp; cannabinergics as well), and boosts opioidergic (diacetylmorphine), GABAergic (etizolam), and NMDA antagonist (dextromethorphan) analgesia A LOT, has quite good analgesic properties of its own (especially for neuropathic pain), is relaxing, makes everything more pleasant, comforting, and engaging, is very smooth and effective as an anxiolytic/anxiety reliever, and is amazing for inactive depression (such as not wanting to engage in anything or participate, but not quite anhedonic).

Gabapentin increases biosynthesis of GABA through inhibition of Branched-Chain Aminotransferase, and decreases biosynthesis of glutamate through Glutamate Dehydrogenase.

In low-moderate doses, such as 1200 - 1800mg per day, this provides a non-imparing, opioid-analgesia.

In quite *high doses*, when combined with certain other drugs, especially opioids **AND** GABAergics together, and/or dissociatives, *this provides* an intoxicating yet energetic, happy, giddy, excited, relaxed, euphorically disoriented and ataxic, endurance-boosting, physical, drunken high, *similar to a* ***stronger version of a low dose of alcohol,*** *rather than* **what alcohol** ***actually*** **feels like in high doses.** (Alcohol decreases NMDA activity and increases GABA activity, like Gabapentin indirectly does).

Gabapentin also blocks α2δ subunits of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels, which is absolutely lovely for getting numbed up and drifting off mentally and floating through reality with a glowing, wavy body, emanating with warmth, and a body high of spontaneous, tingling, moving waves.

**BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE. TEST SMALL AMOUNTS OF CYP3A4 INHIBITORS FIRST! THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS AS WELL AS LETHAL IF YOU ARE RECKLESS!**:

Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Inhibitors are very effective at potentiating opioids, however they may also potentiate etizolam to a degree.

You can just take CYP3A4 Inhibitors and take less etizolam over time, because the way enzyme inhibition works, it's not anything like phenibut/GHB/alcohol/benzos/barbiturates + etizolam, where it potentiates etizolam but also alters the intoxication/effects. 

It's unlike differing depressants, GABA agonists, benzodiazepine site agonists, positive allosteric modulators of GABA receptors, GABA releasing agents, or GABA biosynthesis promoters.

It's just like stronger etizolam, because the enzyme inhibition doesn't alter the psychoactive effects, it just increases the peak plasma concentration and the duration of the effects. 

I recommend grapefruit juice AND pomegranate juice, one right after the other (I usually have a bit more pomegranate juice than grapefruit juice), since they both have different concentrations of different inhibitors.

Furanocoumarins and some flavonoids are found in these drinks, and they inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A4.

This enzyme (CYP3A4) is responsible for metabolizing (breaking down) many substances, including the majority of prescription drugs. 

Opioids like morphine (for which diacetylmorphine/heroin is a prodrug for) are largely metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6, all of which are inhibited by grapefruit/pomegranate's alkaloids.

Morphine and Diacetylmorphine appear not to be metabolized by CYP enzymes much at all.

*I believe that Morphine/Diacetylmorphine are pretty much the ONLY opioids that aren't heavily metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP1A2, but it's worth a shot.*

**Codeine, Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone, Methadone, Fentanyl, etc. are all heavily metabolized by these enzymes.**

*Perhaps this will be more helpful if you get on a different opioid in the future, like codeine, a codone, or a morphone, methadone, or fentanyl.*

*Anyways, it's worth a try now with diacetylmorphine. It probably won't do much at all though, unlike all the rest of the things I've mentioned.*

I personally feel like, at least for kratom, pomegranate juice is more effective than Ruby Red grapefruit juice, the one I use.

The enzyme inhibition is irreversible. It's not nearly as bad as it sounds, that just means that the enzymes must be broken down and new ones must be made for enzyme activity to restore. It takes about 4 days after consuming grapefruit or pomegranate for your enzyme activity to reach 90% of your usual.

White grapefruit juice is supposedly 1^⅓ times as  strong as pink and red grapefruit juice.",1

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the hospital in May 2015, I couldn't eat, walk, or really function.  My body had turned septic from untreated Ulcerative colitis (didn't know I had it at the time).  I had 3 and a half years clean at the time.  After getting admitted into the hospital my favorite drug dealer/enabler, the doctor, asked me if I wanted anything for pain.  Well.. wtf do you think doc?  Mind you, I was in very little pain but I told him I was at an 8.  So 2 perc 5's down the gullet.  Every 2 hours after that I was given an opiate. Whether it be Fentenyl, percs, or morphine, something was entering my body.  So I stayed in the hospital for about 2 weeks, eating pills, and taking IV fent, and convinced my self I didn't relapse because the doctors gave it to me.   I was discharged on June 12th ish, and discovered my wife of 13 years decided to cheat on me while I was in the hospital.  Oh yeah.. I had my 35th birthday in the hospital too.  So there's Rez, in the hospital on his birthday alone.. and the exwife cunt bag is out fucking some dude she met at a wedding a few weeks prior.  I decided to use that as an excuse to start smoking weed.  That eventually led me to the DNM's, which was like nothing I have ever experienced before, and do not want to again.  I had access to things I never heard of before, and I did them all.  So I was pretty much a garbage head until Sept 2015, when I just said fuck this shit.. I know what I really want.  And I was off to the races.  Bundle after bundle, cotton shot after cotton shot, half sickness, the feeling of misery, and hopelessness. I decided to move out of the condo because my excuntbag cheating whore wouldn't stop fucking people besides me and she wouldn't stop smoking crack.  So I moved back to my house in the city, with a friend who has been clean for 10+ years.  he agreed to move in, under one circumstance.. I had to kick by February. Uggggh. That sucked, but I kicked cold turkey right before a 3 foot snow fall.  So I had 5 days clean, and had to literally shovel 3 feet of snow.. I have never wanted to die so much in my life.  Just think of how exhausted we are after kicking.. Now imagine having to shovel for 4 hours.. fuck my life man.  But I stayed clean.... until I wanted to put my wing wang in the ex's who-ha again. I did that in May, and kept hanging out with her until I finally started shooting dope again.  She was smoking crack in front of me, and I figured fuck it.. She is having fun, so can I.  So another birthday came and went, except I OD'd on this one.  I was at the condo with cheater mcfuckseveryone, and OD'd. 100% fell out, seizures, blue lips, drool, puke.. Everything.  Does she call an ambulance? nope, they cost too much money she said.  Instead she gives me shotguns of crack, and slaps me for an hour.  (I didn't die.. lol).  So I kept using until July 10th 2016, and decided to kick for good.  It has almost been 3 years since then, and I am grateful as hell to be clean.  I have buried so many of my friends in the last 3 years man.  It sucks, and doesn't get easier.. But it shows mw what will happen to me if I continue to play with fire.  I will overdose and I will die a miserable lonely junky.

114,2019-06-23 05:23:20+00:00,"Hi, good luck on your surgery! For hospitals, most people could only stay on their bed during their stay and only walk around a bit to exercise/drain the serous blood, so you wouldn't really need anything, but some cases people who do well could even shower! So maybe a few changes of clothes, especially socks and underwear. It could be really boring during your stay, you could bring some books/game console/phone/phone-charger. However you might be too morphined up to be conscious to do anything. Bring some small pillows to prop yourself up too! When I had my surgery, the new state of spine was really uncomfortable to lie on the bed (because my muscles haven't adjusted to it I think), so I cushioned my lower back with 2 small pillows.

At home, it's kind of difficult to sit up straight and climb the stairs during the first 2 weeks, so my family had my bed at the living room, I was lying down most of the time. I drank water from a straw for a week and need to be fed at first. You'll probably need help showering at home, and you'll need a chair in the bathroom to shower and brush your teeth. If you have to shower by yourself, get those shower brushes with long handles! It'll be difficult to raise your arms, so you might need to have buttoned down pyjamas to wear for a week. It's also hard to wear your pants at first, so you'll need help too.",4

130,2019-06-22 16:01:52+00:00,"I generally don't like a big fuss for my birthday, so a drink out after work is usually my go-to celebration. I went out one year with my brother. I met him at a bar, and he was a couple of drinks in when I arrived. I had a couple of beers, and was getting ready to pack it in for the night when the evening took a turn. 

My brother seemed fine, then all of a sudden turned extremely pale, and collapsed. The idiot bartender refused to call 911 (maybe thinking she'd get in trouble for over serving), so I had to talk to dispatch while making sure my brother wasn't choking on vomit or bleeding from a head wound. I spent the rest of the night in the emergency waiting room, having to talk to my parents, my fiancé, and my brother's girlfriend to provide them updates. Luckily, he was fine after getting his stomach pumped and observed overnight. It turns out that, in addition to drinking heavily, he was also popping oxycotin like candy, dealing with an injury, which lead to his collapse. 

Honestly, the worst part of the entire experience didn't happen that night, but instead manifested itself over a long period of time - years, in fact. I spiralled for months, turning to alcohol to mask the feelings of guilt, anxiety, and shame. None of the emotions I felt made any sense, so I didn't know how to deal with them. I didn't know about the pills, but felt like I should have. I also spent a long time wondering if I should have just let him ""snap out of it"" instead of making the decision to call 911. I wondered if he blamed me for essentially shining a light on his issues with pills.

Yes its a message from THIS subreddit, but its still not an EDS problem or win or anything topical. It's just a hate message you got. 

I personally think it's inappropriate to joke about perscribed pain medicine on a drug subreddit during the opiod 'crisis'. So many of us struggle to get any pain medication due to a small population misusing them and an overreaction to it. You joking about how many drugs you're on talking about it like its a multi course meal with a side of fentenyl is a bit insensitive. 

I went through the other posts too, but again, just because you're struggling like everyone else here doesn't mean its OKAY to joke about something many of us with food allergies fear with our fucking lives all because you have something against a personal choice in diet, which you think its funny to violate. It also doesn't make it okay to make pain medication seem like a fun thing or lighthearted, because its a serious issue.

On another note about that food label post- you really think its funny to feed people things they clearly dont want for whatever reason without their knowledge? How would you feel if you were unknowingly forced into a religion you dont believe in? You'd feel fricken violated.

On the east coast of the US it’s almost all white but on the west coast and south you usually can only get tar. And while it smokes well like #3 it’s still not a freebase like #3. It would be interesting to know a definitive answer on exactly how it should be classified though. Also it usually contains a lot of 6-MAM etc and I think that if it’s #4 it would need to be cleaner than #3 since technically #4 should be the pure finished product that you get after completing the steps required to convert the raw opium to morphine and then that morphine to a pure diactylmorphine hcl.

148,2019-06-21 07:43:34+00:00,"I was induced on a Friday. The dr put a string inside my vagina and started me on pitocin. By Saturday night I was on the max pitocin but was not dilated fast enough. By 4 centimeters My contractions got stronger and more painful so I was allowed fentinyl shots every couple of hours. Finally the contractions were unbearably painful so I got the epidural. But as I was getting my epidural I felt a gush of cold liquid enter the right side of my spine. The epidural was only numbing the right side of my body from the waist down. The contractions were so painful I could barely breathe or talk during them. I felt the worst pop and drop in my pelvis. ...My water eventually broke and by Sunday morning my cervix would not dilate wide enough for the baby to pass so I was brought into emergency surgery for C-section. The anesthesia and medicine I was given prior to surgery made me throw up and I was shaking so bad from the anesthesia I could not control it. Apparently since my epidural was not working the anesthesiologist had to give me heavy duty medication to make sure I didn’t feel them cutting into my belly to get my baby out. 
Right before the dr started cutting, I braced myself hoping I didn’t feel the cutting due to all the prior complications with numbing me. 
After my daughter was pulled from my stomach I stopped shaking and suddenly felt euphoric and absolutely great. I’m assuming once the baby was safely pulled out of my body I was allowed to get the good stuff like morphine. 
(I am not petite at all but my pelvis is narrow and I always knew I would not be able to give birth naturally like other woman.) 
Words cannot describe the pain of a contraction while on max pitocin. Every woman is different but damn it hurts. 

I never got to experience giving birth naturally , but recovering from a c-section was no walk in the park either. But I would do it all over again in a heartbeat 💗 to have my beautiful daughter.

150,2019-06-21 06:02:52+00:00," Não reconheço a legitimidade do “DPPL”: o “Direito Penal Para Lula”. Reconheço a ordem democrática, de que faz parte o devido processo legal. A lei evidencia a nulidade do processo que resultou na condenação do ex-presidente. E caberá ao STF dizer se a Lava Jato está subordinada a essa ordem democrática e legal ou se também o tribunal se subordina à [Lava Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/vazamento-nao-compromete-lava-jato-e-busca-inventar-nulidade-diz-procuradora.shtml). Vamos ver.

 O ministro [Sérgio Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/nelsondesa/2019/06/no-centro-de-escandalo-moro-vira-heroi-entre-aspas-para-wp.shtml), da Justiça, inventou uma nova categoria discursiva para tentar justificar as [agressões à ordem legal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/reinaldoazevedo/) que cometeu quando juiz da Lava Jato: trata-se da “[fala quântica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/no-senado-moro-nega-conluio-com-lava-jato-e-trava-embate-com-petistas.shtml)”, aquela que é e que não é, que existe e não existe, que é verdadeira e falsa. Tudo ao mesmo tempo. A trapaça retórica só engana os convertidos.

 Por óbvio, a física não explica o drible na verdade que o ministro tenta dar porque falas quânticas não existem. Trata-se apenas da busca de uma zona intermediária entre a mentira e a verdade.

 E qual é a verdade? Quando juiz, o doutor incidiu no inciso IV do artigo 254 do Código de Processo Penal, a saber: “O juiz dar-se-á por suspeito, e, se não o fizer, poderá ser recusado por qualquer das partes [...] se tiver aconselhado qualquer das partes”.

 No que diz respeito ao ex-presidente Lula ao menos, as conversas entre Moro e Deltan Dallagnol, [reveladas pelo site The Intercept Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/site-publica-mensagens-que-mostram-colaboracao-entre-moro-e-deltan-na-lava-jato.shtml), vão muito além do aconselhamento: trata-se de múltiplas ações concertadas entre o juiz e os procuradores.

 Não só isso. [Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/foi-descuido-meu-diz-moro-sobre-mensagem-a-lava-jato-com-pistas-contra-lula.shtml) violou uma penca de artigos do Código de Ética da Magistratura, em particular o 8º: “O magistrado imparcial é aquele que busca nas provas a verdade dos fatos, com objetividade e fundamento, mantendo ao longo de todo o processo uma distância equivalente das partes, e evita todo o tipo de comportamento que possa refletir favoritismo, predisposição ou preconceito”.

 E como é que o quântico ex-juiz pretende explicar o seu gato jurídico? Ora, ele [não reconhece a autenticidade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/nao-tenho-apego-ao-cargo-se-houver-irregularidade-saio-diz-moro-no-senado.shtml) da troca de mensagens com Deltan, deixando no ar a sugestão de que pode ter havido adulteração, mas, numa atitude protetiva, assegura que, ainda que verdadeira, nada há de mais nas múltiplas agressões à ordem legal.

 A mesma trilha que conduz ao esbulho dos direitos de Lula leva à anomia no direito penal. Se um juiz pode apresentar testemunhas à acusação; condescender com truques para fazê-la falar; anuir com procedimentos heterodoxos para imputar ao réu o que não evidenciam os autos nem a denúncia —caso do PowerPoint—; orientar a desmoralização pública da peça apresentada pela defesa e até interferir na escolha, ainda que por via indireta, do representante do MPF que vai participar de uma audiência, cabe indagar: o que é vedado ao juiz?

 As coisas podem piorar. [Aos senadores Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/de-superministro-a-vidraca-moro-vai-ao-senado-em-seu-momento-mais-delicado.shtml) sustentou que sua crítica ao desempenho da procuradora Laura Tessler foi inócua. Falso como nota de R$ 3. Conversa entre Deltan e o também procurador Carlos Fernando, [que revelei com exclusividade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/lava-jato-discutiu-troca-de-procuradora-apos-critica-de-moro-indicam-dialogos.shtml) no programa “O É da Coisa” e em meu blog, trata da substituição dessa profissional na primeira audiência de que Lula participou em Curitiba.

 E que se note: Carlos Fernando deixou claro, com todas as letras, defendendo a substituição da procuradora, que “no [caso] do Lula, não podemos deixar acontecer” —no caso, deixar acontecer um desempenho considerado insatisfatório. Ou por outra: a mensagem originalmente enviada pelo então juiz a Deltan resultou no tal concerto entre juiz e procuradores contra o que eles consideravam ser o interesse do réu.

 Ora, se o devido processo legal não existe, então tudo é permitido. Já não é suficiente que aquilo a que chamo “Papol” (Partido da Polícia) disponha de uma lei como a 12.850, que permite ao Ministério Público fazer gato e sapato do investigado, transformando delatores em verdadeiras armas contra alvos previamente selecionados?

 Já não basta que juízes de primeira e segunda instâncias —e, com frequência, de terceira— tenham transformado o artigo 312 do Código de Processo Penal, que trata dos requisitos para a prisão preventiva, em matéria de livre interpretação, passível de devaneios os mais subjetivos, como se cada magistrado pudesse fazer uma leitura livre de arcanos que não deste mundo?

 Estamos diante de uma escolha —e essa arbitragem será feita pelo STF: trata-se de decidir se, em nome do combate à corrupção, pode-se cometer uma penca de crimes. A propósito: se esse é um valor absoluto —e tudo, então, é permitido—, por que não havemos de perdoar as agressões à ordem legal cometidas em nome da justiça social?

Almost all ""opioid deaths"" are when people either mix opioids with other things - primarily alcohol and xanax, or buy street opiods that are laced with things like fentayl.  Seriously - try to find one study that shows deaths by opioid overdose alone.  I couldn't find any and I tried.  EVERYTHING I found was ""deaths with opioids present"" and the fine print indicated opioids were just one of several intoxicants.

Very few real pain patients ever overdose.

165,2019-06-19 19:24:55+00:00,There is a big difference between opium and oxycotin. One is sold by a doctor and pushed as safe and nonaddictive despite our great scientific knowledge that proves otherwise.,2
166,2019-06-19 19:04:38+00:00,"Understandable, it is a tough issue to tackle considering we don't have solid ways to test intoxication yet, however research is hard to do and from my understanding extremely limited due to its legal standing, furthermore widespread research about marijuana including a way to detect an active thc level is almost impossible now, I understand that this particular law doesn't correct that but just adding to the conversation. 

Likewise however there's currently no way to even test for prescription or illegal narcotics that hinder the ability to drive far more than marijuana, and frankly it never seemed to be an issue to test someone who might be driving under the influence of Xanax, Oxycodon or even heroin, LSD or PCP. 

All I'm saying is it may not be 100% full proof, but seriously what is? I mean with all the substances that can hinder driving ability that are available, legal or illegal, where are the safety nets everyone is demanding for cannabis, in all of the other substances. It honestly seems like a lot of people have a double standard because this is new and relevant and fail to see the hypocrisy in all of it.",7

Oh and obviously people get hold of firearms illegally too (just less often than people get hold of drugs illegally). 

You can't really argue that the way guns are regulated, and how hard they are to obtain hasn't had an impact on their availability though (it has..) so it has to be about more than just prohibition.

 Nas conversas publicadas pelo site, Moro sugeriu ao Ministério Público Federal trocar a ordem de fases da [Lava Jato](http://arte.folha.uol.com.br/poder/operacao-lava-jato/), cobrou a realização de novas operações, deu conselhos e pistas, antecipou ao menos uma decisão judicial e cobrou dos procuradores uma ação contra o que [chamou de ‘showzinho’ da defesa de Lula](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/moro-sugeriu-a-forca-tarefa-acao-contra-showzinho-da-defesa-de-lula-diz-site.shtml).

 ### RESUMO DOS VAZAMENTOS EM 3 PONTOS

  2. [Mensagens reveladas pelo site The Intercept Brasil ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/site-publica-mensagens-que-mostram-colaboracao-entre-moro-e-deltan-na-lava-jato.shtml)indicam troca de colaboração entre Moro, então juiz, e Deltan, procurador e coordenador da força-tarefa da Lava Jato.
 4. [Segundo a lei](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/entenda-vazamento-de-conversa-entre-moro-e-deltan-e-impacto-para-a-lava-jato.shtml), o juiz não pode auxiliar ou aconselhar nenhuma das partes do processo
 6. [Vazamento pode levar à anulação de condenações proferidas por Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/entenda-vazamento-de-conversa-entre-moro-e-deltan-e-impacto-para-a-lava-jato.shtml), caso haja entendimento que ele era suspeito (comprometido com uma das partes). [Isso inclui o julgamento do ex-presidente Lula](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/lula-tem-derrotas-em-serie-em-pedidos-de-suspeicao-de-juizes-da-lava-jato.shtml)
  Desde a primeira publicação das mensagens, no domingo (9), o deputado David diz que passou a receber ameaças de morte. Encaminhadas à Polícia Federal na terça-feira (11), os ataques, diz, também têm como alvo a sua família. Algumas com ameaças de estupro e esquartejamento.

 No dia 13 de março, David já havia feito uma denúncia-crime sobre ameaças recebidas após [assumir a vaga](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/01/jean-wyllys-sai-como-heroi-passando-o-bastao-para-mim-afirma-david-miranda.shtml) de deputado federal em substituição a Jean Wyllys. O antecessor, eleito em 2018, [afirmou em entrevista à **Folha**](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/01/com-medo-de-ameacas-jean-wyllys-do-psol-desiste-de-mandato-e-deixa-o-brasil.shtml) que desistiu do posto por temer as constantes ameaças que recebia.

 ""Um suplente ainda mais degenerado assume em seu lugar. David Miranda se torna a bola da vez. Fumo nele logo, confrades, pra ver todas as puctas porcas do PSOJA se borrando!”, diz um dos trechos da mensagem.

 Na denúncia encaminhada à polícia, a assessoria jurídica do deputado afirma que, “embora a mensagem seja assinada com o nome de Marcelo Valle, o qual se encontra atualmente preso em decorrência da Operação Bravata, mostra-se possível que tenha sido confeccionada por outros criminosos que atuam no âmbito do fórum denominado 'http://www.dogolachan.org', hospedado na internet/deep web"".

 A deep web é uma parte da web não indexada e acessível apenas por softwares específicos.

 ### Processos podem ser anulados

 Para advogados e professores, a maneira como inicialmente o atual ministro da Justiça e o procurador reagiram à divulgação das conversas, [sem contestar o teor das afirmações e defendendo o comportamento adotado na época](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/mesmo-sem-pericia-stf-pode-usar-em-decisoes-dialogos-de-moro-e-deltan.shtml), aponta que o conteúdo é fidedigno e que ele pode servir de base para reverter decisões da Lava Jato, por exemplo, contra o ex-presidente Lula.

 Por esse raciocínio, o fato de o material ter sido provavelmente obtido por meio de um crime faz com que ele não tenha como ser utilizado para acusar um suspeito, mas possa servir para absolver um acusado. 

 Em um segundo momento, tanto Moro como Deltan passaram não apenas a atacar o crime do vazamento como também colocar em dúvida a integralidade das mensagens divulgadas, ao não afastar a possibilidade de distorções. ​

 Segundo a legislação, [é](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/entenda-vazamento-de-conversa-entre-moro-e-deltan-e-impacto-para-a-lava-jato.shtml)[ papel do juiz se manter imparcial diante da acusação e da defesa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/entenda-vazamento-de-conversa-entre-moro-e-deltan-e-impacto-para-a-lava-jato.shtml). Juízes que estão de alguma forma comprometidos com uma das partes devem se considerar suspeitos e, portanto, impedidos de julgar a ação. Quando isso acontece, o caso é enviado para outro magistrado.

 As [conversas entre Moro e a Lava Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/site-publica-mensagens-que-mostram-colaboracao-entre-moro-e-deltan-na-lava-jato.shtml) também provocaram reação no STF. Na semana que vem, dia 25 (terça-feira), um [pedido dos advogados de Lula pela anulação do processo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/lula-tem-derrotas-em-serie-em-pedidos-de-suspeicao-de-juizes-da-lava-jato.shtml) do tríplex em Guarujá (SP), que levou o petista à prisão em abril do ano passado, será analisado pela Segundo Turma da corte.

 O caso foi desengavetado pelo ministro Gilmar Mendes após a divulgação das mensagens. A solicitação da defesa foi feita sob o argumento de suspeitas na isenção de Moro após ele ter se tornado ministro do governo Jair Bolsonaro. Esse pedido no STF foi reforçado por petição segundo a qual as [conversas de Moro e Deltan](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/entenda-vazamento-de-conversa-entre-moro-e-deltan-e-impacto-para-a-lava-jato.shtml) revelam ""completo rompimento da imparcialidade"" do então juiz da Lava Jato. 

 Nas conversas privadas divulgadas pelo site, membros da força-tarefa fazem referências a casos como o processo que culminou com [a condenação de Lula](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/07/1900580-lula-e-condenado-a-9-anos-por-corrupcao-no-triplex.shtml) por causa do tríplex de Guarujá (SP), no qual o petista é [acusado de receber R$ 3,7 milhões de propina](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/07/1900580-lula-e-condenado-a-9-anos-por-corrupcao-no-triplex.shtml) da empreiteira OAS em decorrência de contratos da empresa com a Petrobras.

 O valor, apontou a acusação, se referia à cessão pela OAS do apartamento tríplex ao ex-presidente, a reformas feitas pela construtora nesse imóvel e ao transporte e armazenamento de seu acervo presidencial. Ele foi condenado pelos crimes de corrupção e lavagem de dinheiro. 

 [Preso em decorrência da sentença de Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/04/lula-e-preso.shtml), Lula [foi impedido de concorrer à Presidência](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/09/tse-barra-candidatura-de-lula-e-pt-tem-dez-dias-para-indicar-substituto.shtml) na eleição do ano passado.

There is something called a functioning addict and that's not what I mean) and have no other means to do so.  If a cane, walker, service dog, and or wheelchair allows you to not use opiates and other pain medication then, no, it's not ok to continue to use then when you have other means to help your pain.  When you don't, then yes.  Its ok.  When you do, not, it's not ok and saying so leads to the massive amounts of herion addicts we have in this country!  

Even when using them, even if it's for life, always be on the look out for addiction and even physical dependency that would be ""normal"" for the body.  Such as needing more medication every month to get the same pain relief.  These signs means you are headed for a possible addiction and you and your doctor need to be honest with each other and there is no shame and possibly even a need to be moved to different medications.  Even different opiates.  Oxycodone and Oxycotin work a lot different then say morphine sulfate and a fentyal patch.  For instance.

To take it just to take it is not ok and I cannot think of a reason that Ren would need opiates or any other pain medication!  She mentioned nerve pain and that's why she's on gabapentin but opiates and other pain medications of the like don't do jack all for nerve pain.  Don't know why else she would need pain medication and gabapentin covers nerve pain.  It's highest dose is, I believe around 1800 mg 3 times a day or so.  She's on 300mg tablets.  She has loads of room to increase that.  Why in the hell does she need other pain meds?  If not, then why advocate for them and the use of them?

2) Furthermore, it was necessary to abrade all parts and remove rust and dirt. I used a wire brush on a drill. It took me more than 2 hours.

3) Next I started painting. I used Antiq 290, which I then lightly grinded with a brass brush. The coating has a glossy, graphite appearance. Then I applied a layer of copper patina that caused the lamp to look older.

The thought of these companies profiting from nature makes me feel sick, seeing as they have lobbied to keep natural medicines that the public have known about for centuries suppressed  in order to sell a daily pill over a one-time (or a few sessions) solution to major mental health issues like depression, addiction, anxiety, PTSD, denationalization type disorders etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Weed has always been harmless. The reports of psychosis are from people that have over done it, or more to the point, been buying strains that were too high THC to CBD ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to really enjoy weed to relax, but that was 20 years ago. I stopped abruptly because I was buying from dealers who themselves didn't know what the hell they were buying. All the kids wanted to get 'monged out', couch locked and high as hell.. whereas I wanted a mellow unwind.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be years until I even knew was CBD was - its the other major component of weed that, while not psychoactive in itself, regulates the THC and balances out the crazy symptoms to make it more what weed should be.. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it was bred out to make room for more THC. In the end, I don't think thats what people wanted - a drug that feels like having your brain blown apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd get back into it if it became legal in the UK and I could actually pick what strain I wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

As for shrooms.. without experience or a trip sitter/guide.. eating a bunch of hallucinogenic mushrooms without planning ahead or trying to go about your daily routine is utterly irresponsible and totally nuts. But from 4-6 hours as opposed to LSD's 12-24 hr trip, its much more manageable and a wonderful introuduction to the magic of it all. Dangerous? NOPE. Healthy - I've never felt better for the 2-3 weeks the afterglow of a wonderful, stimulating, visually gorgeous and inspiring trip left me feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

The first 10 minutes at the peak of the trip I was in tears that I couldn't share my experience with anyone or that \*this\* was deemed illegal because of how beautiful it all was. It made life come to life and I'll never forget that. Despite being the best thing I ever did, I had no desire to repeat it. It was like - this is enough, I've learned what I came for and I'd just be chasing what I already know.

&amp;#x200B;

Ketamine, while definitely more abused and way more complicated in terms of looking after someone losing their mind after doing a touch too much. I still feel that it had huge potential.. 

&amp;#x200B;

And what do you know.. instant treatment resistant depression cure.

&amp;#x200B;

Definitely one for supervision, but hey, lumping EVERY SINGLE drug that exists (or WILL EVER EXIST OR BE INVENTED) is an actual law that the UK passed in May 2016. Anything psychoactive (ie.. changes the way you feel) is now illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

Um.. what?

&amp;#x200B;

Nanny state much? And that law came about because of the whack-a-mole tactics they tried to play with the dealers inventing replacements for banned synthetic THC compounds that were safe to begin with, then evolved into Spice and actual addictive and dangerous version of it - so in order to stop harmless weed, which should be legal anyway, they created a worse problem, then in order to 'win' decided to use the nuclear option and ban everything.

&amp;#x200B;

How'd you think that turned out..

&amp;#x200B;

600% increase in emergency room visits the same weekend due to  turning everyone to street drugs to get their fix after creating Spice addicts and taking away everyones fix that they helped invent anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

The so-called War on Drugs  was lost over 100 years ago when prohibition was enforced. It didn't work then and it won't ever work. Banning alcohol.. see how well that worked. I mean - so many words and phrases we use today come from that era because of the profound impact it had on the world.. It also produced some of the wealthiest criminal gangs and individual crime lords of all time which also became the bloodiest ongoing street battles of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

It never stopped, its just shifted focus. With alcohol legal came the heroi nand cocaine markets and we all know the bigggeste guy in history. Escobar factored $20,000 a month for rubber bands to hold the stacks of cash together - and 10% of total yearly earnings that couldn't be saved as there was no way of getting it processed fast enough to avoid it either rotting or being eaten by rats. At his peak he was making $160,000,000 per day (no, that a typo) and he figured it was quicker and easier to just crash the plane smuggling the drugs and buy a new one instead of going through any more hassle.

&amp;#x200B;

All drug money flows out of whichever country it is siphoned from and not into the economy of these struggling countries - but into the pockets of usually one man. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a complete violation and disruption to the entire system, yet somehow, that is preferable to legalizing smoking grass. .  


It's UTTER madness. These days you've got organised cartels that run entire countries on fear, intimidation and the promise money to the desperate. You've got deafly cuts like Fentanyl straight up murdering people because its cheaper to produce anything decent - where profit is the bottom like.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, this is r/drugscirclejerk.

Second of all, this post is supposed to showcase this kind of ""I TOTALLY get BLASTED off eating raw weed dude!"" shit.

Third of all, Xanax is hydrophobic, and snorting it *actually* does pretty much nothing. Gabapentin isn't very soluble in water either. It's soluble at 4490mg/L of water. Why don't you comment on that shit too?

Fourth of all, boofing an entire extended release oxycodone pill won't do anything. You gotta turn it into powder, preferably dissolved in water.

Fifth of all, intranasal Vyvanse does work. It's just not any more effective, faster onset, or more bioavailable than oral use (96.4% BA orally). It is hydrophilic, and can be absorbed through any mucus membranes.

The ""it isn't intranasally active, it only has effects if you use it orally"" myth is partially because this is somewhat true with some drugs, and partially because of the horrible, despicable behavior of the companies and government when it comes to the marketing.

Oral use makes the drug go right through the liver to metabolize the drug.

Edible weed/decarboxylated cannabis, when smoked, snorted, used bucally/sublingually, boofed, or absorbed through any other mucus membrane, will not be converted into 11-hydroxy-Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, because it doesn't go right to the liver like foods and orally used drugs. 

Dextromethorphan (DXM) won't be converted into Dextrorphan (DXO) unless it goes through the liver (oral use). This is because it is metabolized in the liver.

However, Lisdexamphetamine (Vyvanse) is not just converted in the liver. It is metabolized into L-lysine + dextroamphetamine by protease enzymes in red blood cells using hydrolysis.

The myth of ""it can't be used intranasally"" comes from the dangerously misleading, downright deceitful, abusive, and manipulative marketing strategy.

The producers of Vyvanse did the same thing that the producers of morphones and codones did. 

They are marketing Vyvanse as some ""**abuse-resistant, only orally active, very effective, safe for young children, suitable for long-term use, unsnortable, PERFECT, NEW, NOVEL MOLECULE, NEVER SEEN BEFORE, WITH NEW, UNIQUE EFFECTS, VERY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER ADHD MEDICATION, VERY SAFE, IMPOSSIBLE TO MISUSE, NON-DEPENDENCE-CAUSING, NON-ADDICTIVE COMPOUND!**"", when in reality it's literally just L-lysine plus Dextroamphetamine, which is then split into L-lysine and Dextroamphetamine by protease enzymes in red blood cells by hydrolysis.

They even try to hide the fact that it's an amphetamine. They say it's a new drug that has much different, much safer, much less recreational effects, when literally ALL of its effects come from the Dextroamphetamine it's converted into.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if there's a whole ""Vyvanse/Amphetamine epidemic"" soon, like the ""opioid epidemic"".

I'd just like to say ***THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ANY OPIOIDS OR AMPHETAMINES! THE MARKETING IS THE PROBLEM HERE, AS WITH OXYCONTIN/OXYCODONE, VICODIN/HYDROCODONE, OPANA/OXYMORPHONE, AND  DILAUDID/HYDROMORPHONE!***

Opioids and amphetamines can be used very safely, but people are misled because of the bullshit claims the companies make.

I hope that the same shit that happened with the opioid ""crisis"" (people blaming the drugs instead of the companies) doesn't happen with Vyvanse and shit.

Vyvanse should be treated much like Dextroamphetamine, not like some ""abuse-resistant, non abusable drug, with just as effective potential but less euphoric and much safer than Adderall and Dexedrine!""

That information appeared to be backed up and confirmed by the FDA who approved the product for the manufacturer specified use. The approval from the FDA gave the doctors confidence to believe what the literature they’d been provided said. After all, this is the system in place for this very reason. The FDA approval is like a rubber stamp saying that the product does what it says. What is often forgotten is that it actually only means the product does it better than the placebo alternative would. However, that doesn’t negate the fact that it has shown to do what the manufacturer claims. 


This next part is entirely my opinion. While based on facts, I do not claim to know exactly what caused the opioid crisis or the true catalyst of it. 

The biggest problem, in my opinion, was that Perdue was able to get their product through the FDA in about 9 months, when most products take several years of study before approval. The short time spent in this process wouldn’t have allowed for accurate studies that would have shown the potential for addiction was clearly still there. A lot of the approval hung on the longer time release technology, which went from 4 hour to 12 hours and also the failure of the FDA to anticipate the craftiness of drug addicts.  They didn’t believe that people would crush and snort these pills. Why they thought that, I have no fucking idea. But at the start, they only placed a warning on the product to not crush and inject. It was the proliferation of insufflation that really allowed Oxycotin abuse to spread among the more casual users and fuel the fire that has resulted in the opioid crisis.",3

Also, I thought the sugary part was so it would appeal to kids more (just guessing) like how when I was a kid I loved Advil bc it had a sugar coating

You've seen where this path goes. Just as I did two years ago. You know that if you continue to deny the truth about your situation and disagree with the voice inside of your head saying ""enough"", you will end up alone, scared, and full of regret. If not dead or institutionalized. 

&amp;#x200B;

The path of cleanliness is not an easy one. I'm almost certain you will still struggle, most addicts do. It's easy to say ""enough"" after you've done (or thought) something you regret. In those moments it's \*easy\* to self actualize change. The struggle comes 6 months down the road, a year down the road, 5 years down the road. With the aid of time,  It's easy to forget what the addict inside of you is capable of.

Wrong. You're hurting yourself. You're hurting your future relationships by setting this precedent. You're hurting the good deeds that you are capable of.

And by that someone can have 10years sober but still haven’t change the behaviors that comes with the disease. And someone like you, can have 6 months without use but have strong recovery. And I believe that just because it bothers you means that you’re not just sober you’re in recovery. Be proud of that.

 Somadas, as hashtags #vazajato, #morocriminoso e #lulalivre tiveram 597 mil menções entre as 18h de domingo (9) e as 8h de terça (11). No outro pólo, as que defendem o ex-juiz (#euapoioalavajato e #deportagreenwald) registraram 394 mil citações.

  Uma novidade no debate é a campanha nas redes pela deportação do jornalista americano Glenn Greenwald, responsável pelo site. Os diálogos mostram Moro e Deltan discutindo procedimentos e fases da Lava Jato, além de deixarem claro que havia dúvidas nos investigadores sobre o envolvimento de Lula com corrupção no caso tríplex.

 Como mostra o gráfico abaixo, a hashtag #deportagreenwald surgiu no início da tarde de segunda-feira (10) e aos poucos foi encorpando. No fim do dia, já estava empatava com #vazajato e #morocriminoso. E ganhava com alguma folga de #lulalivre.

  Por volta das 20h30 de segunda, o DAPP-FGV registrou pico de 2.315 menções a cada ciclo de meia hora para a defesa da deportação.

 Vivendo no Brasil há anos, Greenwald é [casado com o deputado federal David Miranda (PSOL-RJ)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/01/jean-wyllys-sai-como-heroi-passando-o-bastao-para-mim-afirma-david-miranda.shtml). Apesar da gritaria dos lavajatistas e bolsonaristas nas redes, não há nenhum sinal até agora de que o governo esteja planejando alguma medida de proibir sua estada no país.

 Em 2004, vale lembrar, o governo Lula ameaçou [revogar o visto do jornalista americano Larry Rohter](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/05/jornalista-quase-expulso-do-brasil-lanca-biografia-do-marechal-rondon.shtml) por não ter gostado de reportagem feita por ele no jornal The New York Times sobre os hábitos etílicos do petista, mas depois recuou.

 A análise dos dados mostra que houve duas ondas de reação à reportagem do Intercept. O primeiro pico, dos críticos à Lava Jato, chegou a 12 mil menções no Twitter a cada ciclo de meia hora no final do domingo. O segundo, em reação, começou na manhã de segunda.

 Essa situação, obviamente, é parcial ainda, visto que Greenwald promete novas revelações. Aguardemos.",1

293,2019-06-11 14:55:03+00:00,"All of the estimates you keep listing are from 2016/2016 bud. You're still failing to realize that the number coming has INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY since these estimates were made and **THEY DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THAT**. The estimates are only accurate if we the number coming in stayed consistent with 2015-2016 but thats not the case. We're on track to doubling that. Which means the ""estimates"" would be higher than they were.   
  
&gt; If you think their estimates are wrong, feel free to write a paper disproving their math and get published. If not, you're just hollering ""fake news,"" and we're all sick of hearing it.  
  
It's simple bud. If the average number of apprehensions has been around 400k-500k and their estimates are around 11M. Year to date we have had about **675K apprehensions ** which is WAY HIGHER THAN BEFORE WHICH MEANS THEIR ESTIMATES DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THAT INCREASE.   
  
I build predictive models and do this type of analysis daily. You're making assumptions without knowing what you're actually saying. Your hypothesis was true until this year.  
  
 &gt;  They pay taxes, unlike Trump. Yes, I know that the right-wing idiot machine says they don't, but they are taxed through payroll taxes, and pay $12 billion more in SS taxes than they collect, and they are ineligible for most tax benefits (except emergency medicaid).  
  
Do you truly believe all **illegal immigrants** pay taxes? lmao It's literally **illegal** for them to work a job bud.  
  
https://www.fairus.org/issue/publications-resources/fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-united-states-taxpayers  
  
In 2017, the total cost of illegal immigration for the United States – at the federal, state, and local levels – was approximately **$116 billion.**  
  
Evidence shows that the tax payments made by **illegal aliens fail to cover the costs of the many services they consume.**  
  
A large percentage of illegal aliens who work in the underground economy frequently **avoid paying any income tax at all.**  
  
Many illegal aliens actually receive a net cash profit through refundable tax credit programs.  
  
It's better to be an illegal immigrant than a US citizen. You're literally suggesting that you want to pay billions to anyone that is able to illegally cross our border and avoid the legal process instead of those billions going to US citizens....... We have millions of people in poverty yet you want to just give our money away to illegal immigrants....... Thats the crisis and thats why you all sound so dumb supporting it.  
  
&gt; they don't vote. They can't.  
  
Jesus, you guys are delusional.  
  
https://www.fairus.org/issue/societal-impact/noncitizens-voting-violations-and-us-elections  
  
If we take the mean of these three estimates -- 7.25 percent -- and apply it to just the 22 million non-citizen residents currently in the United States, then **approximately 1.6 million non-citizens vote every year.** According to the high and low estimates here, that number could be as high as 2.9 million (at 13 percent of 22 million), or as low as 528,000 (2.4 percent of 22 million). Both are unacceptably high numbers.  
  
So by supporting illegal immigration you supporting putting illegal immigrants before US citizens, your taxes go to them and they're actually getting rewarded for getting across our border. You're giving priority to **illegal** immigrants over **legal** immigrants.  
  
Now let's look at all the other stuff that you try to ignore -  
https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics  
  
About 10K criminals apprehended a year. How many of these do we not catch?  
  
Average per year -
50K lbs of cocaine  
5k lbs of heroin 
40K lbs of fetanyl  
  
If you didn't know, you encourage that too because that comes with allowing anyone to cross our borders without going through the legal process or through border security. Plus all the cartel members than you're suggesting should be allowed to freely cross our border.  
  
You're encouraging [all these people dying at the border](https://www.statista.com/statistics/455890/immigrant-deaths-near-the-southwest-border-in-the-us/)  
  
You're supporting and encouraging [all these crimes](https://www.illegalaliencrimereport.com/)  
  
 CHARGE: ILLEGAL ALIEN BROTHERS, WOMAN HAVE BEEN RAPING CHILDREN FOR 15 YEARS  
  
MORE THAN 500 POUNDS OF MEXICAN METHAMPHETAMINE SEIZED IN ARIZONA

CHARGE: ILLEGAL ALIENS GANG-RAPED 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL IN NORTH CAROLINA  
  
**That's only from june of this year...........**  
  
You can try to ignore all that evidence as much as you want but by supporting illegal immigration you're encouraging all of those things to continue happening. Those crimes are the tip of the ice berg. I can post tons of articles related to children being kidnapped, sold, trafficked to people so they can take advantage of our aslyum loopholes. That's why we have 11K unaccompanied children trying to cross the border.  
  
In statistics terms, all of your views and opinions are on the **assumption** that ALL illegal immigrants are good people which the data proves your assumption is not true. You want to reward anyone that can illegally cross our border and give them better benefits than you receive. Can you explain your reasoning for that? I don't understand that at all.  
  
How the fuck do you support all that man? That's some fucked up shit honestly. You can't deny it either as much as you want too or justify it. No amount of good people justifies all the other people that get hurt by allowing mass illegal immigration.",1

To say that anytime you do heroin could be your last is being alarmist. Heroin is a surprisingly sneaky drug because it doesn’t screw you up that bad. You can go to work on it, it doesn’t give you hangovers, honestly you feel great. So you start doing it a little more and a little more till you reach the point where you get sick when you don’t have it. But it’s not like playing Russian roulette every time you do it. I’ve done it countless times and never come close to overdosing. Been plenty dope sick when it ran out though.

 My intuition says cocaine is a lot more alluring than you suggest, but I'm also the kind of guy who buys motrin from three pharmacies so I don't look suspicious. Maybe my intuition is a little screwy on that point? I'm looking at the data from Portugal, as you suggested—an increase from ~1-2% in usage after posession was decriminalized. That's not a lot.



You raise a lot of good points and I'm reconsidering my stance.  I'm guessing that the best way to prevent serious harm is by providing economic stimulus to low-income areas, not by a Sessionite policing policy (which was always cover for stop-and-frisk anyway).",6

316,2019-06-09 17:26:21+00:00,"In 2011, the first year we kept stats on overdoses, there were 6 deaths.  Last year there were over 600.  Oxycotin was discontinued in 2012.  We didnt want people abusing oxycotin, so we made an alternative that was more expensive and couldn't be cut.   The largest contribution to the increase in overdose deaths is the discontinuation of oxycotin.  

When oxycotin was discontinued, users looked for a way to keep getting high and dealers looked for an alternative product to sell since you could no longer get a cuttable product from a pharmacy.  At the same time, governments cracked down on doctors and less oxy was prescribed (about 48% less from 2012 to 2016).  This resulted in fentanyl being used as a replacement.  

I'm 100% on board with supervised consumption sites only because they save taxpayer money.  We have shown that previous governments actions on this file have actually made the problem much much worse.   Overdose deaths have increased over 10,000% since 2011. 

Generally speaking, conservatives aren't going to be supportive of taxpayer dollars to help junkies get high.  Especially when those dollars are used to fund clinics that bring inevitably increased crime and drug use in the immediate are.  If we want to get through to those that dont support the sites, we need to make a financial argument, not an emotional appeal.  People are going to be apprehensive about a safe consumption in their community, especially outside of metro areas.   Even though I completly support the sites, I sure wouldnt want one in my community. 

I have family and friends who struggle with addiction.  I don't know the solution, and I don't think anyone does.   The cycle will continue until we figure out how to prevent people from using for the first time.  It is nearly impossible to stop using these types of drugs once they have started.",1

I stay in the scene as a non user because I am willing to use my knoledge to help others dose safely. The fact of the matter is your not going to stop people from using, but I feel I can help to give addicts the time they need to come to the realization they actually do need help.

Very few addicts live a long life. Iether they die of OD, or they shake their addiction. I intend to save as many people from ODing as possible.

The fact of the matter is no addict is proud of their habits. but that is what makes it an addiction. it literally overrides/hotwires your brains reward systems. a lot of non users think its just a pleasure thing, but its so much more. Once your on it, you psysically cant stop without going thru, at the minimum, 2 week long withdrawls which make you feel worse then any flu you've had.

371,2019-06-05 10:37:58+00:00,"i often find a biggest part of the misunderstanding around addictions centers around this ""i know someone who stopped after this many years etc why cant you"". 

medical treatment of addiction does follow the disease/genetic model but doesnt address that there is a huge difference between people who have the disease of addiction, and people who have found themselves chemically defendant but are otherwise normal. oxycotin addicts who are able to take suboxone and eventually become sober or people who just by will power overcome their dependancy are people who in my opinion dont have the actual disease. 

i do know for a fact though if you have the literal disease of addiction you can never safely use any psychoactive drug (apart from the dmt family and healing planta etc). 

a large part of why this is ignored i think has to do with addiction being but a symptom of a disease that is spiritual in nature. science doesnt like this premise, but people who suffer can identify remarkable similar experiences on why they use.  the most common thread being "" i have never felt okay as a person, there has been this hole in me my entire life, reality isnt tolerable without a substance, and i cannot handle how much and how deeply i feel things emotionally"". id say if you have these symptoms then be very very careful about drinking or pot, as even though they are not your drug of choice once you indulge in using a chemical to feel okay, it is inevitable you will return to your drug of choice and the cycle starts again. 

im jealous of those who can stop heroin and then drink normally or smoke pot, its not an option for me as ive proven to myself over and over. iboga was the best detox and most healing thing ive ever taken but the experience didnt rid me of the affliction and i returned to using almost immediately, id say the most constructive use of this plant would be for detox/spiritual experience then the person should immediately enter treatment (rehab) then aftercare. the 12 step path for me is incredibly rewarding in terms of spiritual growth and maintinance, it also gave me the perspective shift that dmt and iboga gave but naturally and lasting.


last point, i hate alcohol. but after a year sober from everything i was wondering if i could drink again. i wanted to be normal. and i justified it until i did and within 3 months id wrecked my life and returned to heroin, biggest lesson i learned was this :

if normal people hate orange juice, they just dont drink it. they wouldnt spend weeks justifying or coming up with reasons why they could. this logic is a sure fire way to diagnose your motivations.",1

I never really cared about these things until after I became a kratom user.. it opened my eyes too to the dark side of the world.

Remember pharma bro? Might be the only time people really cared because this dude was not hiding how corrupt he was.. but everyone else is hiding their corruption and keeping a low profile. BTW drug prices increase every year.. they do it because they can.. and the people who pay for it are us desperate citizens. Many people died because they couldn't afford insulin.. it's very sad. The FDA's approval process is now only 60 days.. they reject only 19%.. compared to 59% in 2010.. very alarming. They use ZERO science when testing and approving drugs.

Indonesia during Konfrontasi did a lot of shit to Malaysia, which includes Singapore because we were one country then. I remember reading about more bombings that weren't successful in killing or injuring people.   


What is VC? I was 1SIR and I quite liked history so I read up their archives when I was there. We were converted to a Malaysian Infantry Regiment and deployed to West Malaysia but I don't remember reading or honouring any fallen. Do you have a source on that part?   


Erm, there is a lot of discussion on the motivations of why Indonesia decided to Konfrontasi but I don't think being a racist was a main one. Attacking and controlling the southern tip of the Malaysian peninsular was probably a strategic decision but perhaps stoked politically with racial undertones. Never seen any history on Indonesia side where they were saying to attack Singapore because they chinese. Source would be nice if you have!  


Sigh, let's not attack people, it doesn't contribute to the discussion. Both sides had some interesting reads. Although, the RSIS commentary is a bit strange.

""There isn't addicts without suppliers""

This is untrue. Drugs are quite popular; they sell themselves. Demand creates suppliers, not vice versa, otherwise you'd see the need to market drugs.

""America wouldn't have a cocaine problem without Columbia.""

The only cocaine problem in the USA is that it's been illegal since the 1920s. But alas, cocaine is grown in many places apart from Colombia; Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar also Cultivate Cocaine. Cocaine from all these countries finds its way to buyers in the USA through their respective cartel networks.

""Russia wouldn't have a heroine problem without the heroine fields In Afghanistan.""

Did you bother to read my first post? Russians have a Heroin problem because the USSR is gone; which creates the social conditions for people to want to buy Heroin. If Afghanistan wasn't there, it'd just be supplied by North Korea/Laos/Cambodia, which it already is to a lessor extent.

""America is culpable for the cheap price of heroine across the globe.""

This is false; the USA leads the world in counter narcotics operations; the DEA is an extra terratorial organisation that globally enforces the UN's Narcotics Convention. Infact; it was the USA who pressured every UN signatory to sign in the first place. All these counter narcotic operations reduce supply, put small scale suppliers in jail, and give tremendous profits to larger cartels that can still evade the DEA. The USA is the reason why Heroin is $60/g when it should be $3/g.

""Growing a drug that destroys lives.""

Drugs dont destroy lives, mentally ill people destroy their own lives.


""The crop has no legitimate purpose.""

You realise that opium is processed to make Oxycotin?  Apart from recreational use; commercial opium cultivation is vital to the pharmaceutical industry in production if sedatives/painkillers/anesthetics.

""We could destroy the whole thing in weeks if we wanted to""

Half of the Taliban's opium fields are in Iran, Tajikistan and Pakistan; good luck with that. There's also the matter that poppies are literally indigenous to the region. Their fucking weeds that grow on the side of most mountains. Wipe out one crop, and the next year another field will spring back full of them.

410,2019-06-01 18:02:53+00:00," Em fevereiro de 2015, o técnico Mauricio Pochettino, 47, do [Tottenham](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/ligado-aos-judeus-tottenham-ja-sediou-jogo-da-alemanha-nazista.shtml), concedeu longa (e rara) entrevista exclusiva ao repórter Diego Borinsky, da extinta revista argentina El Gráfico.

 Quando Borinsky pergunta ao ex-zagueiro qual foi a sua maior referência como treinador, Pochettino não hesita. ""Logicamente [Marcelo [Bielsa]](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/08/reverenciado-bielsa-e-monoglota-e-acumula-causos-com-tradutores.shtml), o técnico com quem mais tempo passei"", disse.

 Funcionário das categorias de base do Newell's Old Boys no fim da década de 1980, [Bielsa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/11/analista-foi-descoberto-por-bielsa-em-radio-e-ja-trabalhou-em-cinco-copas.shtml) descobriu Pochettino em uma das viagens que fazia com seu Fiat 147 pela província de Santa Fe em busca de jovens promissores para o clube.

 Juntos, foram bicampeões argentinos no profissional do Newell's no início da década seguinte. Bielsa também levou Pochettino para a Copa do Mundo de 2002, [na qual a Argentina fracassou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/esporte/ult92u42454.shtml) caindo na fase de grupos.

 Em comum, além das referências futebolísticas, fruto do convívio próximo, ambos carregam o mesmo rótulo com relação aos seus trabalhos: o de que seus times jogam bem e até encantam, mas não ganham.

 Uma escrita que Pochettino tentará mudar [diante do Liverpool](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/unico-jogador-na-capa-de-sgt-peppers-foi-idolo-e-goleador-do-liverpool.shtml), na final da [Champions ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/liga-dos-campeoes/)[League](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/liga-dos-campeoes/), em Madri, neste sábado (1º), com transmissão [da TNT e do Facebook do Esporte Interativo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/sem-globo-final-da-champions-estara-na-tv-fechada-facebook-e-metro.shtml).

 Pochettino chegou à Inglaterra em 2013, contratado pelo Southampton, tornando-se apenas o segundo argentino a treinar um clube da elite inglesa em toda a história.

 A boa temporada à frente dos Saints chamou a atenção da [Premier ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/03/livro-sobre-premier-league-relata-revolucao-nos-direitos-de-tv-no-futebol.shtml)[League](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/03/livro-sobre-premier-league-relata-revolucao-nos-direitos-de-tv-no-futebol.shtml). Porém, em uma liga por onde passam alguns dos mais badalados técnicos do mundo, só havia um clube para o qual Pochettino parecia destinado a ir depois do Southampton. Justamente o pioneiro no país em colocar um argentino no comando de sua equipe.

 Campeão do mundo [com a Argentina em 1978](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/06/heroi-argentino-contra-a-franca-em-1978-perdeu-o-irmao-no-dia-da-partida.shtml), o meio-campista Osvaldo Ardiles se transferiu do Huracán ao Tottenham após o Mundial.

 Com o time do norte de Londres, o atleta foi campeão da Copa da Inglaterra em 1981 e 1982. Foi neste ano que Argentina e Inglaterra entraram [em guerra pelas Ilhas Malvinas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2015/04/1614439-argentina-e-reino-unido-tem-novo-embate-sobre-petroleo-nas-malvinas.shtml).

 Poderia ter sido o fim para Ardiles, emprestado ao Paris Saint-Germain por uma temporada, mas o retorno ao Tottenham para conquistar a Copa da Uefa (hoje Liga Europa) em 1984 ajudou o meia a cativar de vez o carinho dos torcedores e o respeito de todo o futebol inglês.

 A passagem de sucesso como jogador foi o que permitiu a Osvaldo Ardiles ser o primeiro argentino a trabalhar como técnico na elite do país. Com curta experiência na função, foi contratado na segunda metade da temporada 1993/1994 para tentar salvar o time do rebaixamento. Missão que concluiu com sucesso.

 Ainda na primeira metade da temporada seguinte, não resistiu aos maus resultados e foi demitido. Mas, de certa forma, com o respeito que adquiriu na memória de torcedores e do clube, abriu o caminho para Mauricio Pochettino, o segundo forasteiro a treinar a equipe de White Hart Lane.

 ""O que posso dizer sobre a importância de Mauricio? É total! Ele é tudo para esta equipe. É um tipo extraordinário. Tem a capacidade de tirar tudo o que um jogador tem a oferecer. É autêntico, entende o que o jogador pensa. Os jogadores confiam inteiramente nele"", afirma Ardiles, o pioneiro, à **Folha**.

 Para chegar à decisão, o Tottenham protagonizou verdadeira façanha no jogo de volta da semifinal da Champions, contra o Ajax, em Amsterdã. Derrotado [por 1 a 0 na ida em Londres](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/04/ajax-derrota-tottenham-em-londres-e-fica-perto-da-final-da-copa-dos-campeoes.shtml), o time foi à Holanda precisando vencer para pelo menos forçar a prorrogação. No intervalo de jogo, contudo, já estava 2 a 0 para o Ajax.

 Na etapa final, Lucas recolocou os ingleses na partida com dois gols que deixaram tudo igual no placar. Aos 51 minutos do segundo tempo, um improvável terceiro gol com a perna esquerda do meia-atacante brasileiro [colocou o Tottenham na final](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/heroi-discreto-lucas-superou-pior-fase-da-carreira-por-topo-na-europa.shtml), a primeira da história do clube na competição.

 ""Foi um momento inesquecível, não só pela classificação histórica, mas pelo que representou. Pela maneira como os Spurs (apelido do Tottenham) jogaram. Com coragem até o fim, buscando o resultado. Foi um jogo incrível e deu orgulho a todos"", conta Ardiles, que hoje trabalha como embaixador do clube.

 Técnico desde 2009, quando estreou na função pelo Espanyol, onde foi jogador e campeão como atleta, Pochettino construiu toda a sua carreira de treinador na Europa.

 O próprio reconhece, na entrevista à El Gráfico de 2015, que isso facilitou sua ida à Inglaterra há seis anos, quando o Southampton decidiu apostar em seu trabalho.

 ""É que tampouco me consideram argentino, já que praticamente toda a minha carreira fiz na Espanha. Me veem mais como um treinador europeu do que argentino"", disse ao repórter Diego Borinsky.

 Mauricio Pochettino brinca, inclusive, que foi ele quem abriu as portas do continente europeu a [Diego ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2016/05/1774328-indocil-simeone-se-consagra-como-o-maior-tecnico-do-atletico-de-madri.shtml)[Simeone](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2016/05/1774328-indocil-simeone-se-consagra-como-o-maior-tecnico-do-atletico-de-madri.shtml).

 ""Ganhamos [com o Espanyol] por 4 a 2 do Atlético de Madrid dirigido por [Gregorio] Manzano e em poucos dias o demitiram e contrataram o Cholo [Simeone]. Assim que, se você revisar a história, creio que o caminho foi inverso, ele não me abriu nada, eu que abri a ele"", brincou o técnico do Tottenham.

 Diferentemente do conterrâneo, porém, Pochettino ainda busca seu primeiro título como treinador na carreira.

 O mais perto que chegou disso no comando do clube de Londres foi o vice-campeonato da Premier League na temporada 2016/2017, sete pontos [atrás do Chelsea de Antonio Conte](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2017/05/1883754-chelsea-sofre-mas-vence-o-west-bromwich-no-fim-e-e-campeao-ingles.shtml).

 Ainda que tenha terminado as últimas três edições do Inglês à frente do maior rival, o Arsenal, a ausência de troféus relevantes pesa contra o Tottenham. Sua última grande conquista foi a Copa da Inglaterra em 1990/1991.

 Para Osvaldo Ardiles, há uma boa possibilidade de encerrar o jejum em Madri, diante do Liverpool. Se não ocorrer, não crê que o trabalho do argentino deva ser considerado um fracasso. Afinal, o clube londrino chegou à final da Champions pela primeira vez em sua história sem ter feito uma contratação sequer para a temporada.

 ""Isso é uma besteira, não? Ele é jovem, vai conquistar muitos títulos. O patamar que ele está colocando os Spurs vale como título. Você vê isso quando percebe que o treinador se torna a imagem de uma equipe. A imagem dos Spurs é a de Mauricio.""",1

 Na atual função, a de técnico, o alemão [tem uma imagem de prestígio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/05/com-empatia-energia-e-entendimento-klopp-transforma-o-liverpool.shtml) que nem de longe conseguiu alcançar como jogador.

 Atleta medíocre, algo que o próprio reconhece, teve longa carreira na segunda divisão de seu país. Foi o ápice que o atacante transformado em zagueiro alcançou com as chuteiras no pé.

 Não tivesse seguido com sucesso a carreira de treinador no Mainz e no Borussia Dortmund, o atual comandante do Liverpool poderia ter enveredado para uma carreira no jornalismo esportivo. E não foi por falta de oportunidade ou aptidão para encarar a tarefa, como mostra o livro ""Klopp"", de Raphael Honigstein, [lançado recentemente em português](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/01/com-crise-no-setor-literatura-de-futebol-batalha-para-estabelecer-nicho.shtml) pela Editora Grande Área.

 O contato inicial com o ambiente jornalístico aconteceu no início da década de 1990, pouco tempo após sua chegada ao Mainz 05, clube que defendeu de 1990 a 2001 em mais de 300 partidas até se aposentar.

 Primeiro canal de televisão estatal da Alemanha a se tornar propriedade privada, o SAT1, que cobria a [Bundesliga](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/bayern-e-campeao-alemao-em-adeus-de-robben-e-ribery.shtml), tinha um escritório regional no estado da Renânia-Palatinado, que tem a cidade de Mainz como capital.

 Contando com uma equipe formada basicamente por freelancers e jornalistas recém-formados, a editoria de esportes da seção regional contratou Klopp para um período de três meses de estágio.

 O zagueiro-repórter sabia que a segunda divisão alemã poderia não lhe garantir um grande futuro. Paralelamente ao estágio e aos treinos e jogos no Mainz, Klopp ainda estudava Ciências do Esporte na Universidade de Frankfurt, um trajeto de aproximadamente 40 minutos de carro todos os dias.

 Logo no começo da experiência no SAT1, conseguiu emplacar uma reportagem sobre as irmãs Röschinger, as duas mais bem-sucedidas atletas de snowboard da região. Além da entrevista, fez também a narração e a edição do material que foi ao ar.

 A segunda matéria de destaque do talentoso estagiário foi na reta decisiva da Bundesliga de 1991/1992.

 O Eintracht Frankfurt brigava pelo título com o Stuttgart e o Borussia Dortmund. Os três estavam empatados na liderança da competição faltando apenas uma rodada. Mas o Eintracht, dono de futebol vistoso em uma época na qual a liga alemã não estava acostumada a isso, era a grande sensação.

 O desafio do jovem repórter? Entrevistar o técnico da equipe, Dragoslav Stepanovic, que recusara todos os pedidos de entrevista prévios ao jogo.

 Jürgen Klopp havia sido atleta de Stepanovic no pequeno Rot-Weiss Frankfurt. Mas seu contato para conseguir a entrevista foi um companheiro de Mainz, Hendrik Weiss, cuja mãe era assessora de imprensa do [aeroporto de Frankfurt](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2008/01/363117-aeroporto-de-frankfurt-bate-recorde-de-passageiros-em-2007.shtml).

 Antes de o Eintracht partir para o nordeste do país, onde enfrentaria o Hansa Rostok, ela deixou Klopp passar pela segurança e facilitou sua ida até as portas do avião. Ali, ele parou Stepanovic e fez algumas perguntas. Foi o único em todo o país a tirar do treinador um par de declarações às vésperas do jogo decisivo.

 Amigo do hoje treinador, Martin Quast lembra ao livro de Honigstein que o CEO do canal televisivo, Jürgen Doetz, garantiu a ele um emprego no SAT1 se a carreira no Mainz não decolasse. ""Kloppo, se esse negócio com o futebol não der certo para você, vou transformá-lo em diretor de comunicação da SAT1. Não tem erro"", disse Doetz.

 Com o fim do estágio, o zagueiro voltou suas atenções ao Mainz 05 e aos estudos na Universidade de Frankfurt. Jogou por 11 anos no clube até pendurar as chuteiras em 2001 e prontamente aceitar o convite da diretoria para assumir o comando do time.

 Em 2005, a emissora ZDF, dona dos direitos de transmissão da Copa das Confederações daquele ano e da [Copa do Mundo no ano seguinte](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/especial/2006/copa/guia_das_sedes-frankfurt.shtml), ambas na Alemanha, tinha o ídolo alemão Franz Beckenbauer como principal nome no time de comentaristas para a cobertura dos torneios.

 Mas como Beckenbauer era o chefe do comitê organizador do Mundial, ele não estaria disponível para todas as transmissões. Dieter Gruschwitz, editor de esportes do canal, decidiu inovar.

 A ZDF colocou em prática o uso de um painel interativo que combinava imagens de vídeo e a possibilidade de desenhar e brincar com as imagens das partidas. Hoje o recurso é amplamente utilizado, mas na época era novidade.

 E para uma ferramenta ousada como aquela, Gruschwitz pensou em alguém igualmente irreverente para utiliza-la: Jürgen Klopp, com quem compartilhava alguns copos de cerveja durante a semana para falar sobre futebol. Só havia uma preocupação.

 ""Sabia que ele podia analisar uma partida, mas será que os telespectadores acreditariam em um treinador da segunda divisão falando sobre futebol internacional em seu mais alto nível? A diferença entre o Mainz e a seleção brasileira não era grande demais?"", pensou o editor.

 No início, Beckenbauer também pensou o mesmo, mas rapidamente mudou de ideia. ""Depois de duas ou três vezes ele falou: 'Uau, o modo como ele explica o jogo é ótimo'. Após algumas partidas da Copa das Confederações, Beckenbauer estava absolutamente surpreso com Jürgen"", conta Gruschwitz.

 Segundo o livro, Klopp também usou seu carisma para conquistar Pelé, convidado pela ZDF para algumas participações no canal e que também se encantou com o alemão.

 Apesar do aparente talento para os comentários, a carreira do treinador decolou. No Mainz, levou o clube à primeira divisão da Alemanha pela primeira vez na história, além de uma classificação à Copa da Uefa (hoje Liga Europa).

 No Borussia Dortmund, foi bicampeão da Bundesliga e carregou a equipe à final da Champions League da temporada 2012/2013, que acabou com o vice diante do Bayern de Munique.

 À frente do Liverpool, também foi vice da Champions —em 2018, contra o Real Madrid. Uma escrita que ele tentará mudar na decisão com o Tottenham, em Madri.

 No momento em que achar que não há mais energia para seguir com a carreira de técnico, o alemão sabe que não faltarão convites de emprego.

 ""Ele tinha talento e havia se divertido fazendo aquilo [jornalismo]. Tempos depois, Klopp disse: 'Se não tivesse dado certo no futebol, eu provavelmente teria acabado sendo repórter esportivo'"", revela Martin Quast, amigo do zagueiro-técnico-comentarista.

 Klopp parece ter demonstrado mais interesse pelo jornalismo ao longo da vida do que pela política, por exemplo. O que não impediu o alemão de falar sobre o tema em algumas ocasiões.

 ""Não diria que sou muito ligado à política, mas sou de esquerda, claro. Meu entendimento de política é o seguinte: se estou bem de vida, quero que os outros também estejam. Se há algo que jamais vou fazer na vida é votar na direita"", disse ele, que é contra o [brexit](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/dominante-futebol-ingles-flerta-com-volta-ao-passado-com-brexit.shtml), em entrevista ao jornal Die Tageszeitung, em 2009.",1

418,2019-06-01 10:55:10+00:00,"Of course you don't 'need' that high of a dose. Synastone and similar were the absolute gold standard pharmaceuticals from the moment diamorphine stopped being widely prescribed in the late 60's/early 70's. Pethidine would have been seen as an alternative, but for the various Misuse of Drugs acts between 71 and '75, which heavily pushed methadone as the stuff you were encouraged to give junkies (with some strong arming from the UN and the Nixon administration, if you believe various ex-heads of the Home Office Drugs Inspectorate).
Because the climate towards drug users was still largely benign (like everything here, it's about class-the earliest junkies were middle-class doctors/lawyers/actors/musicians, if not actual poor little rich girl aristos), concessions were put in place to prevent people clamouring to keep their diamorphone. Injectable methadone ampoules, either in their dry 'powder' form or the still extant 1ml or 2ml bottles, bear as much relation to oral methadone as snorting cocaine does to injecting it. Not to mention this was L-methadone, not the D-methadone they prescribe in the states, or the DL-that is almost ubiquitous worldwide now. Years of isometric research have led to stuff like 'methadose', the canned food of methadone, designed to have as small a pleasurable or euphoric effect as possible, whilst still actually killing pain.
So yes, people would have 600ml a day scripts, into which you could throw in dexedrine (a lot of the old time junkies would always dissolve dexedrine in their amps), rohypnol and basically whatever else you asked for, as long as it wasn't heroin. No wonder a lot of users described their prescriptions as 'second morgages'. The chemist bill could run into hundreds of pounds weekly, even in the 80's. It goes without saying that most of this stuff found its way to the black market, which is why I called IV methadone the gold standard for street users for decades. It probably still is, but far, far less ubiquitous.

421,2019-06-01 02:03:03+00:00," Pela primeira vez em dez anos a final da [Champions ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/liga-dos-campeoes/)[League](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/liga-dos-campeoes/) não terá transmissão em TV aberta no Brasil. A [Globo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/03/globo-prioriza-futebol-e-dois-gps-da-f-1-devem-ficar-sem-tv-aberta.shtml) se recusou a fazer propostas para comprar os direitos de transmissão para o contrato que começou em 2018 e vai até 2021.

 Será a primeira vez desde 2008 que a emissora não vai mostrar a final do torneio europeu.

 Band, Record, Rede TV! e Cultura, emissoras que nas últimas duas décadas mostraram a final em algum momento, também não apresentaram ofertas.

A partida deste sábado (1º) entre [Tottenham ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/heroi-discreto-lucas-superou-pior-fase-da-carreira-por-topo-na-europa.shtml)[Hotspur](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/heroi-discreto-lucas-superou-pior-fase-da-carreira-por-topo-na-europa.shtml) e [Liverpool](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/liverpool-joga-para-superar-city-e-repetir-facanha-do-passado.shtml), ambos da Inglaterra, às 16h, terá transmissão para o Brasil pela Internet, na página do Esporte Interativo no Facebook e na [TNT, canal do grupo Turner,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/turner-tem-uma-partida-por-rodada-no-brasileiro-veja-que-jogo-cada-tv-pode-exibir.shtml) em TV fechada.

 As imagens da Turner também serão mostradas em 180 salas de cinema de 14 redes ao redor do Brasil, com venda de ingressos e endereços disponíveis no [Cinelive](https://webmail.grupofolha.com.br/OWA/redir.aspx?C=rdjsVni8dQxvE8FyVqoIb0GrFkYNpJMvTbI3S0oeUR5oYCYi--XWCA..&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cinelive.com.br%2fprogramacao%2fevento%2f83%2ffinal-da-uefa-champions-league-2019.html). O preço do bilhete é R$ 68,39.

 A cervejaria Heineken, uma das patrocinadoras do torneio, instalou quatro telões de led na estação Paraíso do metrô de São Paulo para exibir a partida. 

 A Champions League é atrativa para as emissoras pela capacidade de atrair audiência em qualquer plataforma. Na partida de volta das semifinais deste ano, entre [Liverpool e Barcelona (ESP)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/liverpool-obtem-virada-historica-contra-o-barcelona-e-vai-a-final-da-champions.shtml), a TNT registrou a maior audiência de uma partida de futebol em TV fechada na história do país. Atingiu 8,17 pontos de audiência. 

 A final do ano passado, entre [Real Madrid (ESP) e Liverpool](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/05/real-madrid-derrota-liverpool-e-ganha-liga-dos-campeoes-pela-3a-vez-seguida.shtml) fez a Globo registrar 23 pontos de audiência com picos de 40 pontos em São Paulo. Somada à Band, que também mostrou a partida com imagens cedidas pela Globo, a marca foi de 28 pontos, recorde para a decisão do torneio no Brasil.

 Em entrevista ao site SportBusiness, Hans Erik Tuij, responsável pelos patrocínios da Heineken, mostrou preocupação com a ausência de jogos da Champions League em TV aberta, o que poderá voltar a acontecer no Brasil apenas na final de 2022.

 Os contratos de Facebook e da Turner são de exclusividade e a próxima concorrência para a venda de direitos de TV está marcada para 2021. 

 A transmissão de TV é uma das principais fontes de receita dos clubes que disputam a Champions League, torneio mais lucrativo para os clubes europeus. 

 Entre prêmios por participação, classificações em cada fase, coeficiente da Uefa (que enumera o desempenho da equipe nos últimos anos) e dinheiro de TV, o Liverpool arrecadou nesta temporada 107 milhões de euros (R$ 470 milhões) e o Tottenham, 102 milhões de euros (R$ 448 milhões).

 Apenas na divisão do dinheiro pago pela TV, o Tottenham arrecadou mais. Embolsou 16,1 milhões de euros (R$ 70,7 milhões) contra 12,7 milhões de euros do Liverpool (R$ 55,8 milhões). Quem for campeão, receberá mais 4 milhões de euros (R$ 17,5 milhões).",1
