I'm not sure you're in the know about what keeping drugs illegal costs this country. I don't care to explain, as you're clearly not educated enough to understand the knock on effects of policy decisions. Suffice it to say, when added up, we lose hundreds of billions annually due to the drug war. 
Your anecdote undermines your point.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

61,2020-09-28 04:31:18+00:00,"Basically what you are describing is something called Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia. There is a a couple problems with this condition. The first being that many times a diagnosis of OIH is made, what is really being described is opioid tolerance, the loss of efficacy over time as your body become drug saturated. It has to include an increase in pain from normal stimuli, so it can't be confused with a worsening condition. So when a doc makes a call of OIH, its often incorrect and their only concern is getting the patient off these drugs.

The other issue with OIH is poor documentation. The paper that ""discovered"" this alleged condition was an extremely shabby piece of work, based totally on rodents with restless leg syndrome and their reactions when placed on a hotplate. The human portion was based on the responses of heroin addicts who were transitioning over to methadone. I am sure they were feeling well enough to give some real feedback on what they were physically feeling /s.

The medical community and government were fast to pick up this shoddy piece of science and share it among themselves, thus making each entity that shared it a evidential reference. The FDA shared it with the DEA, DEA shared it with CDC who used the mentions from FDA and DEA as solid evidence for the existence of this condition. Doctors shared it among themselves adding patient experiences with opioid tolerance and each became evidence in itself. For a while publishing a paper about OIH was all the rage in the medical community. It was just in time too, patients were starting to question the meaningless dose cuts and discontinuations. Now they had a vehicle they could point to as a justification. 

To be clear, I am not saying OIH doesnt exist. The evidence is just poor quality, and it is often used to describe normal opioid tolerance. If it does truly exist, its rare.

So that being said, is it your ""normal"" pain that has increased or do you find that clipping your toenails is suddenly painful?  Normal experiences become painful. It cant have anything to do with your regular pain for it to be opioid induced hyperalgesia.  In your case its probably just normal tolerance.

They dont have to keep upping your dose. Its usually a better strategy to rotate medications. Each opioid is a little different and will give your saturated receptors time to clear. Now if youre on a long acting opioid (OxyContin, MSContin) its a little different since the goal is baseline pain rather than flare ups.  With the longer acting drugs, its important to get on an adequate dose to begin with. If its done right you can be stable on the same dose for decades.

Finally there are a couple non Rx drugs you can take that will undo your opioid tolerance. Dextromethorophan is found in many cough medicines. Just be aware of any interactions with other drugs you may be taking. If you want more info, give a shout, but you really should approach your doctor about this. They absolutely need to know what is taking place with you if they are to help. Best of luck...",1

A lot of the issues with the police stem from the first thing that they do in a stressful situation is reach for their weapon and fire.

I could see it being legitimate if they were trying to incapacitate someone running away by shooting them in the leg, but the police are apparently just shooting to kill. If those fuckers shot my pet because it charged them, I would do my best to ruin their life, because they did mine.

Regarding George Floyd; I don't fucking care what he had in his system, they were using excessive for to restrain him. I cannot think of a reason that 4-5 officers can't handle the situation enough, and still have to put their knee on someone's neck.

My County has a high ass drug population, so they test for whatever the drug of choice that month is, and make you pay for it. (The drug of choice is usually fentanol, or heroin) 

My own drug test came back positive for PCP and THC even though I don't smoke. I'm not positive because I was never told which pill[s] it was, but having looked into it, I think it was a combo of my Paxil, trazadone, and lamictal. Again, I'm no doctor so I can't be sure.

It also came back positive for amphetamines which I actually knew about, and had told them about. (Whaddup ADHD) I wasn't prepared for the PCP and weed accusations though. And it was a fucking nightmare to try to prove otherwise because I didn't have the money for another test, so I didn't get the job.

Anti-psychotics and antidepressants are also 110% abusable depending on your drug of choice. (I know Paxil is supremely easy to get addicted to, even if you don't abuse it, and lamictal can apparently get you high.) 

A lot of people are on antidepressants and Anti-psychotics, but sometimes the pill combination is wack and will turn up false positives. It fucking sucks that we have to disclose information on the medication we take, (in my county at least, it's 'required') and I really fucking hope that changes but I doubt it will.",1

She needs to stay in bed and wear no underwear or some very soft large panties, but make sure they don't compress the area, because thst would affect circulation. Make sure urinary bag is emptied regularly. If you see stiches start properly healing (usually 5-7 days post-op) she can take shower, but no direct stream on op-site. Wash very gently around the area. Painkillers I was given were ibuprofen and novamin, plus oxycodon (codeine) for severe pain (ask doctors). Ultra important keep incision sites clean! Do not touch with bare hands, use single use latex gloves. Use sterile saline to clean incision sites if necessary, do not wipe, gently apply. Use some ointment(s) for faster healing (ask doctor, or gp). She needs to resume HRT to normal so regain strength (ask doctor, endocrinologist). Make sure she's got good mood.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

89,2020-09-26 20:35:28+00:00,"He did have fetanyl AND methamphetamine (i think) in his body when he died. However, what killed him weren‚Äôt the drugs themselves; it was the extensive stress put onto his body being in the situation he was in, such as being pinned down by multiple cops placing their knees on his neck and back. In combination with the fact he had heart disease, along likely the various chemical interactions with the drugs altering his behavior and mental state, sending him into an anxiety attack, he was killed by the cops. I still put it on the cops for the excessive force they used, even when they were ‚Äútrying‚Äù to help Floyd; like, he asked to be put on the ground (if this even true), not pinned down with at least two grown men putting their weight on him. If he did OD, he would‚Äôve comatose/unresponsive before he was ruled to be dead. The drugs likely did play a role in his death, but it was due to various other stimulatory inputs in addition to that.

If you were buying pills that you dont know 100% were real you could have fetanyl in you and eventually it will work its way out. I switched from a high dose of methadone and put myself into pw on purpose with 24mg to push the methadone off my receptors and get the process rolling. If you are taking small doses of bup its probably pushing a little bit off making you sick but then fetanyl is leaching from your fat back into your blood and back onto the receptors.

1. it creates a new stream of revenue for the government.Which can be used to open rehabillation centres which can distribute sterilized needles it iv drug abusers and pamphlets explaining the risk if drugs to new users
2. The second one is from personal experience the absolute shit pot I've scored in my time which is spiked which has lead to numerous bts is too many to count at this point..using a regulatory body we can basically quality check them and make sure they're not too shit and not too potent(especially for the harder stuff like heroin where they cut it with Coke and fetanyl)

 In my country there is also no real prescription opiod problem like in the US. You are really unlikely to get anything like oxycodon or hydrocodon. If you are lucky you will get one box (with like 10 to 20 pills without a refill) of dihydrocodeine or tramadol and that also only if you break some bones or are in the process of dying.

113,2020-09-25 19:50:08+00:00,"Context for this post, im a newly qualified UK paramedic who saw this patient recently. Initially his ECG showed a sinus rhythm with what I believed to be multiple ectopic beats and compensatory pauses. On a closer inspection (after the call) I'm thinking it could be a Mobitz type one.
During this assessment I noticed my monitor was now showing a tachycardia of 130BPM. We retook the ECG and I initially thought a possible junctional tachycardia as I could not see any P-waves. I also noticed some ST-depression in V4-V6 and I assumed this may be rate related. On a more thorough look at the ECG I believe there could be retrograde P waves in V1? So i'm not sure. Anyway, here's the history/assessment of this patient:

I attended this 74YOM for feeling generally unwell over the past 2/7, his family 
report that he has been going hot and cold, had a poor colour, not been himself and
today had one episode of diaphoresis approx 2-3 hours before we attended. During this
the pt did not report any SOB/CCP/syncope or any prodromal symptoms. He was seen in the
community by his GP 2 days ago and started on ABx for a possible UTI whilst waiting for
the results of a urine culture. 

(For some reason our dispatch told us this job was a case of autonomic dysreflexia and the patient may require ventilation).

He has a PMH of recent lacunar stroke for which he was only discharged 1 week ago. During this hospital
stay his family report the pt suffered with a number of chest infections and UTIs. This was not 
on his hospital records however. This stroke has left him with right sided paralysis, he also has a permanently dislocated 
R shoulder (which I've never come across) and a benign growth in his R leg for which he
is not receiving any treatment for. 

I can't remember exactly what medication he was on however I do recall oromorph for 
analgesia and he has a DNACPR in place. 

O/A - The pt was laid in a hospital type bed, immediately alert and responding to voice. There
was no obvious distress and the patient had a good colour.

O/E -

A - Patent

B - Good respiratory effort with equal expansion of the chest and talking in full 
sentences with a respiratory rate of 20. SpO2 of 95% on RA. On chest auscultation he had good air entry at the top of his
chest however at the bases it was very reduced bilaterally. No crackles/wheezes. Normal resonance to percussion. No recent coughs/sputum.


C - Intially measured at 80BPM with an irregular radial pulse. The pt was warm peripherally with a CRT&lt;2.
There was no sweating or clamminess and no rashes or mottling of the skin. The pt had an initial blood pressure of 104 systolic. His temperature was measured at 
37.4 (99.32F).


D - GCS15. His blood sugar was normal I can't remember exactly, around 7mmol.


E - No recent trauma, no new wounds or injuries to this patient.


Due to his tachycardia and possibility of infection we took this patient to the ED as he was hitting our sepsis criteria. Once on the ambulance the patient became hypotensive at 87 systolic and his HR maintained at 130. His GCS did not drop during this period but his colour worsed and he became sweaty. He did not report any pain or any symptoms at all during this. I attempted IV access but was unsucssesful (big shame). We were 10 minutes from hospital so I decided to go instead of delay any longer and we transported him lights and sirens to our local hospital. I raised his legs up on the stretcher and on arrival to hospital his BP was 114 systolic, HR the same.

Initially I was worried about the possibilities of sepsis but I was also worried about a possible cardiac event causing haemodynamic instability.
I thought it was interesting and I'm still quite new so I'd love any input!

Thanks.",1

115,2020-09-25 19:16:24+00:00,"If a drug dealer sells a product that leads directly to death, e.g.  a heroin dealer selling a ""hot dose"" laced with fetanyl that causes an overdose, then that dealer will often be charged with murder or manslaughter.  But if the dealer sells someone heroin that over several years leads to someone's health decline and eventual death, that person would never be charged with those kinds of crimes.  And that's why tobacco companies aren't.  A single cigarette or a pack or a carton never killed anyone.

With that said, I'm not sure why the CEO is being singled out.  Tobacco CEO's are not the founders of the company.  They are employees of the company, just like the accountant on the 3rd floor or the factory worker who is running the machine making the cigarettes.  If you wanted to hold the company itself accountable, that would be a civil issue because you can't put a corporation in prison.  And the tobacco companies have indeed been held accountable in the late 1990's when they were sued by various states for Medicaid reimbursement.  They agreed to a $206 billion settlement, then starting in 2018, a $9 billion annual payment in perpetuity, i.e. forever.  They also agreed to donate billions to anti-smoking organizations, provide cessation advice to smokers, stop campaigns that children might find appealing (that's why Joe Camel went away), and various other concessions. And despite all of that, they are still in business.

Edit:. To add to my train of thought on this:  cigarettes don't CAUSE cancer or other diseases, despite simplistic messages to the contrary.  To be scientifically accurate, they increase the risk (sometimes dramatically) of contracting various health issues.  Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers contract lung cancer.  However, 80 percent of people who die from lung cancer are smokers.  So smoking is definitely unhealthy and can contribute to the development of various cancers, heart disease, high blood pressure, etc.  But it's not like shooting someone. Or killing someone while drinking and driving.",1

Theres a couple other things like him saying he couldnt breathe long before the cops were on him and saying he was to claustrophobic to get into the cop car but they found him in his car.

So the answer to that question is it depends.  Now I've also heard that the one has had complaints against him before so we'll see.

se ele decidiu ir la sendo ingenuo ou se queria bancar o machao ou se estava consciente mais ou menos do q poderia acontecer, ninguem sabe.


mas at√© ai ele nao fez nada de IMORAL, ele quebrou algumas LEIS, mas nada muito grave.


o tribunal vai avaliar as a√ß√µes dele, e os videos de advogados renomados na internet ja disseram quase por unanimidade q as 3 pessoas em quem ele atirou tende a ser visto como legitima defesa.

ele estava com mais meia duzia de pessoas armadas como mostram os videos, foi num momento q ele estava sozinho q os covardes correram atras dele pelas costas e jogaram coisas nele, essa milicia estava la justamente porque a policia abandonou a area e videos mostram manifestantes incendiando lojas e mais de 10 carros num local proximo, os moradores locais queriam a policia q nao ia estar ali por conta do protesto, logo do ponto de vista moral era justo e ideal q voluntarios fossem la.

entao √© dificil alguem querer afirmar q ele fez errado do ponto de vista moral, eu e provavelmente os moradores daquelas ruas estejam extremamente gratos a ele e queiram votar nele se ele virar candidato, se vc ver mta gente nos EUA esta tratando ele como heroi, mesmo a grande midia demonizando ele, alias isso √© mais um ponto onde todo mundo deveria defender ele, porque ele foi heroico em se arriscar a caso tivesse q se defender atirando em alguem acabar sendo demonizado e tendo sua vida destruida e familia perseguida pela midia e pelos antifa, e foi justamente o q aconteceu, mesmo sem saber ele no momento √© o simbolo do jovem q ajudou todo mundo a enxergar melhor o q estava acontecendo la, todo nosso debate aqui s√≥ existe pq ele agiu.

agora, sinceramente, enquanto milh√µes nos EUA e provavelmente a comunidade onde houve as depreda√ß√µes ve um certo heroismo nele, uns mais outros menos, vc q provavlemente n√£o esta la, nem na cidade onde tudo aconteceu, ve ele mais negativamente do q positivamente, sua vis√£o acaba indo pro mesmo caminho do ""politicamente correto"", isso √© bem comodo, eu queria ver se vc estivesse la e fosse a sua casa e o seu carro incendiados se vc seria contra os jovens voluntarios.",1

I was 21 when my leg swelled up big time, my weight went up from 9 stone to 16 stone and they thought lupus.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms i've had/have:

&amp;#x200B;

Fatigue, joint pain, tender points all over body, morphea starting on side, heart palpitations, sweating, brain fog, hair loss, red/swollen painful hands, tightening of fingers, weird bruising, random pain, kidney pain, twitching of hands/arms/eyelids, feeling like im going to collapse/faint, feeling jittery or so tired despite eating well/getting enough sleep, that pain in the muscles when even just going up a few stairs, legs feel like they're going to give way....i mean, theres too much to list. A lot of these immune disorders are very similar and you get really weird crap going on, its bizarre, i ignore most of it now

&amp;#x200B;

Im sure my heart will mess up one day, im 30 and its completely rubbish, i get bad pains when exercising, down the arm, the shoulders and in the chest but i just leave it as the doctors just keep waiting to see what my body does and im past caring tbh

&amp;#x200B;

It was ANA in blood and fingernail capillaroscopy plus other symptoms like raynauds and stomach issues/fatigue etc that got me that diagnosis but who knows, might be lupus

Ive found strict diet, AIP but more lenient has helped my body amazingly...i'd be a total mess if i didnt cut out gluten/eggs/nuts etc and i know a man who has been in remission from this disease for 8 years from a super strict diet, its amazing!

&gt;Hell, I even considered attending a protest in June.Also, I don't believe myself to hold any radical opinions, so I can certainly say I disagree with the arguments of some people that say BLM. However, when it takes days, weeks, or months of public protest to make an arrest in cases like Floyd's or Taylor's, that indicates that, at the very least, the local law enforcement is corrupt. The cause of their corruption may not be racially based, but, if it is, that is systematic racism, at least on the local level.

Floyd was a violent career criminal who was high on meth and fetanyl with the coronavirus when he died. The coroner even said that he could have died anywhere else on his own of an overdose, and that there were no signs of strangulation or damage on his neck (only the private coroner claimed there was). How is a unhealthy drug addict dying a form of corrupt police?

Taylor's case was literally released today. Video evidence from the crime scene supports that the cops announced themselves before entering and forensics shows Taylor's boyfriend shot at police first anyway before they returned fire. Could you please tell me where the corruption is from police when they were defending themselves?

See. You just gave two examples, both of which had absolutely zero to do with racism or police corruption as the reason you wanted to attend a rally. You either don't care about the actual circumstances around those cases (which is an issue) or you are just uneducated about them (also an issue). Now picture a few million people believing the same falsehoods you do and try to fathom how big of a fucking problem that is.",1

And so you are suggest legalizing all drugs? Do you know why it‚Äôs weed and not drugs like coke, meth and heroin that is getting legalized ? It‚Äôs not rocket science. Legalizing hard drugs and I‚Äôm assuming you mean recreational would be disastrous and that should be painfully obvious to anyone. Drugs are not equals. They each have profoundly different impacts on people and society as a whole. Weed is getting legalized because well besides that tax money it‚Äôs not going to turn communities upside down. There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt allow oxycotin to be sold over the counter to anyone who wants it. It sounds like a cute little stance to have when your a teenager, I used to have it myself when I was young but its incredibly naive. This notion that things would be better if we could regulate and get all that tax money is just pure horse shit. Regardless of regulation, There would be far far more overdoses  because those substances would be so much more prominent in society. Obviously not everyone is going to try meth if it were legal but way more people would if it were a legitimate industry out in the open. Most people who overdose are doing so on clean product, because these hard drugs are dangerous themselves. Just look at all the people who are overdoing on prescriptions. People highly overestimate the number of overdoses via laced drugs.  

Being a drug addict doesn‚Äôt make one a bad person, of course not. Being a hard drug dealer does of course. Big difference between a user and a dealer. My cousin used to sell heroin, he got out of prison a few years ago and he deeply regrets his past Actions. He now instead of preying on addicts, he helps them out. He‚Äôs so passionate about helping addicts. He even also helps cops arrest dealers too. He‚Äôs gotten so many people clean in his city. I think we should have more compassion for drug addicts. I want to treat the users and punish the dealers like Portugal does. I support decriminalizing all drugs but legalizing all drugs is absolutely crazy.",1

You're the perfect example of uneducated people making uneducated opinions about things they know nothing about. Which was entirely the point of what was posted. People like you knowing virtually nothing at all that isn't propaganda.

[Even the left leaning Snopes confirms Floyd's criminal past, including multiple counts of drug possession with intent to sell. He literally was a fucking drug dealer mate](https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/06/12/george-floyd-criminal-record/). Yet because you get all of your news from CNN and Facebook, you wouldn't actually know that would you. I'm going to guess you also don't know about the instances of armed robbery, trespassing and theft. 

[Next you're going to tell me that you didn't know he had enough meth and fetanyl in his system to kill a man, while having the fucking coronavirus](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/04/869278494/medical-examiners-autopsy-reveals-george-floyd-had-positive-test-for-coronavirus).

Your body produces a painkilling hormone called endorphins. Endo = within and ""orphin"" as in morphine (the painkiller).

Adding a painkiller like morphine will boost your system with a similar painkiller to the endorphins. This works well, but with chronic use your body changes its baseline in response and you need more to get pain relief.

If you have taken it over time and this has happened, it will hurt to stop them, even if the source of pain is gone, because you are experiencing a reverse effect.

Add to this that a surge of morphine feels good/euphoric/relaxing, you have a strong addiction potential. Physical addiction as in feeling painful and sick when withdrawing, in addition to this you get low mood and jumpiness.",1

She would start shit with other kids, and when they'd kick her ass, it was always THEIR fault and by the time she was in middle school, her parents told the school if they ever disciplined her for 'fighting back' they'd sue them.

Well to her that was carte blanch to start shit all day long and when the other kid would throw the first punch, she'd never get disciplined for starting it and for the bullying and harassment she engaged in.

She went so far as to sucker punch my little brother one day while waiting on the bus to go home.  The famous family temper, which he rarely succumbs to, arose in him and he laid her low for her nonsense, then they wanted to expel him for 'hitting a girl'.  All hell broke loose and needless to say, he wasn't expelled.  She legit deserved what she got.

As she matured, no one would take her to task for her bullshit because my uncle was a small town assistant chief of police... the few that did got arrested while she went free.  Because she was never to blame, it was always the other person.

Rock on to a few years ago, and we avoid her like the plague but she lives a quarter mile down the same country road we do, she starts drama with me about my kids, who were mid-teens at the time.  Just keeps on trying to piss me off, and she's notorious for bullying people mercilessly...  because y'know by the time you're 40ish, most classy people aren't going to throw down like white trash skanks.  So they always back down from her and just... endure her hatefulness.

Not me.  I was prepared to get white trash skanky because fuck her.  I'm not going to live my life with her trashy ass harassing me.  I put on my boots (cowboy work boots) my jeans and a white tshirt and told her to start walking my way and we'd meet in the middle and 'sort shit out'.  She never responded, never showed, never talked to me again.  My husband came home from work, saw me in a white tshirt, asked but why a white tshirt?

I said I was going to start beating her ass and not let up till someone pulled me off, and by then, she'd be damn good and bloody... and I wanted her to see her own blood on my white tshirt... and I was going to frame the shirt and put it on the wall.

She still treats other people like shit, and it's always their fault, and she's now the biggest dealer of oxycotin around... but fuck her.  I won't be a victim of her shit.  I'm still pissed, can't you tell?  And people like her, of any age, piss me right off... and now we're seeing the culmination of multiple generations of people like her, of all colors.",1

181,2020-09-23 06:35:35+00:00,"When it comes to death, the frequency you experience client death really depends on quite a few factors. What population? The worried well (private practice work) will rarely see deaths like this. Nursing home/geriatrics/hospice care? Sort of inevitable. Substance use treatment? Depending on the lethality of the substance, can be relatively infrequent or every once in a great while (I live in an area heavily affected by heroin/fetanyl,  so lethality is much higher than areas with less lethal substance use). Inpatient psychiatric? Very minimal chance. Partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient? Always the potential but probably infrequently. 

Of the 5 years I've been in the field, I've had 1 client death. It was a surprise to everyone in the agency and difficult for us to manage but we supported each other, our agency provided a space to discuss our concerns and grief, and we each went to our own personal therapy to grieve and debrief about the experience. I still think about the client every once in a while but it isn't as consuming as it once was.

There are plenty of other things other than patient suicide that take a toll on the mental health of a therapist. For example, a client going AWOL. Hearing client's traumas. Imposter syndrome. It's really important for therapists to go to therapy as well to manage all of these things, as well as client deaths, in order to be an effective therapist and be present for their clients.",1

&gt;  
&gt;Firstly, I want to start by thanking you for going through all the work and doing the sheer volumes of research that you've done to validate your points. It really is comprehensive work. I don't agree completely, and I'll get into that in a moment, but I don't want you to think my response is coming from a place of blind hate.In my experience with BLM (marching with protesters in Portland, OR and generally just watching the whole debacle unfold) the primary issue isn't that so many people are dying, or that cops jobs aren't dangerous. It's that when bad cops do bad work: no one is held accountable.Chicago's Police code of silence 1 arrest and most involved kept their jobs. Whistleblowers harassed to this day.Rodney King: Officers caught on tape violently beating a man: all officers acquitted.And the List goes on: Ferguson, Freddie Grey, Philando Castile, Daniel Shaver.All of these people killed by police, most on tape, most without any reasonable cause. The death of Danial Shaver SHOWS he was complying with orders, and unarmed. no officers were charged with in these deaths.These happen in every corner of the US, from Missouri, to New York, California to Georgia.The real question everyone has been trying to ask that no one wants to answer is this:What is the next step when a murderer isn't held accountable for murder?Yes, I agree that ultimately more people will die in car crashes this week then will be killed by police this year, but for the friends and families in these communities, who know that police will kill their, brothers, sisters, and children and then walk away with no punishment....how do they find justice?Is it overblown? yes. Did anyone care when there wasn't riots about it? no. So, unfortunately, the lesson to learn here is that we have to riot to get justice.So look forward to more. Because, until the justice system steps up and holds bad cops accountable, THIS WONT STOP.

People say that there's no accountability, when there's dozens of police officers currently in jail for such crimes as the ones you mentioned. You know, like the cops that killed Floyd (whom the coroner said had so much meth and fetanyl in his system he could have died anywhere else and it would have been an OD) and Brooks (who repeatedly attacked police before being shot). But despite obvious instances of accountability, the riots still happen and people still claim that there isn't any ""justice"". Which is false. People are just ignoring the justice and the circumstances that are there.

As well, we get into the nitty gritty of each individual case because not a single incident is the same. You mention Ferguson, where this all started. [As if there wasn't an investigation that found Brown's DNA on the weapon of the officer he attacked in their car, as if multiple ""witnesses"" weren't discovered to have been lying about events through forensic evidence](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/report-autopsy-suggests-michael-brown-reached-ferguson-officers-gun-n231391). And people still treat a justifiable shooting as if it had anything to do with racism. It was the first incident of a black person attacking a cop, being killed, and being glorified by the media and activists, which has obviously been repeated over and over and over.

[Castille was stopped due to his resemblance to an armed robber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OPmCWB0BGo&amp;ab_channel=DonutOperator). He was  told repeatedly not to reach for his legally owned gun, which he did anyway. Any reasonable person would fear for their safety in front of an armed suspect who isn't complying with commands. He died being stupid, not for being black.

Shaver was white (though that case was horrific, but again, it's one out of hundreds of millions of people, bad shit happens). And honestly I don't know enough about Grey to argue that point (it's been a long day of responding, I got over a 1000 comments through multiple threads). My point is, most of the cases you mentioned here about police accountability, I would argue are either already resolved (police in jail), or justified shootings, or just horrible accidents or individual ineptitude. Those aren't a reflection of the entirety of policing. They aren't even statistically a small fraction. They're minuscule. But yet, even with your open mind, you believe it to be a much broader issue than they actually are.

I've mentioned elsewhere, but I do think that there is room for police reform in some jurisdictions especially, and that unions and bouncing around the bad cops is bad for everybody. But those aren't conversations we can have honestly and openly if everyone is too caught up on the propaganda parts of those conversations. You can't discuss Shaver in the same sentence as say Jacob Blake and expect to be taken seriously. One was a dreadful situation, the other was cosmic karma for him being a shitty human being.

The fact that you can sit there and claim that the riots are for justice for people like this is absurd.",1

&gt;What is this garbage? First of all, this isn‚Äôt JP related at all. Post this somewhere else where it belongs.

sjw mobs and censorship of opposing opinions isn't related to JP? I don't think you've been following along to the past decade of society have you? This is directly related to the type of work he's done. And evidently it's of high interest to the community. But thank you for speaking for everyone else who clearly disagrees with you. I must have missed the JP sub vote for president where you were elected.  


&gt;Second, the methodology can not be accessed.

Multiple people in this thread have already located the original study, It's not complicated. The article states where it got it's information, you can just look it up for yourself if you want the methodology instead of being lazy and complaining.   


&gt;Third, it‚Äôs coming from an alt-right website?

According to you. And? What's your point? The article is based on a widespread study from a leftist organization. Are you bitching about the opinions from a right wing website (which is irrelevant to the content) or are you saying the original study is now faulty because it's on a right wing website? Either way that's pretty stupid and goes a long way in explaining the braindead hivemind if more people think like you.  


&gt;Finally, it‚Äôs pretty shitty journalism to speculate at all, let alone on the death George Floyd. The cause of death has already been ruled. 

It has. And it said that he was so high on meth and fetanyl that if he had died anywhere else the coroner would have said it was an overdose. There's a reason the cop is going to get off of the charge.   


&gt;The article is shit and you‚Äôre shit too.

Ich bekam eine Zeit lang immer mal wieder Heroin, ein paar mal Oxycodon und ein paar Wochen lang kam ich an Furanyl-Fentanyl-Nasenspray, aber nichts war dort wirklich stabil. Meine l√§ngste Phase mit Heroin durchgehend ging so zwei, drei Wochen, dazwischen nahm ich aber immer Kratom, das darin enthaltene Mitragynin sowie das 7-Hydroxy-Mitragynine sind eben auch Opioide, welche zwar keinen stark unangenehmen Entzug ausl√∂sen (und wesentlich sicherer sind), aber auf Dauer auch k√∂rperlich abh√§ngig machen k√∂nnen. 
So kam es, dass ich √ºber drei Jahre immer irgend ein Opioid im Organismus hatte, dauerhaft Kratom, √∂fters mal Codein, teils Tramadol und wenn ich ne Quelle hatte eben Oxycodon, Heroin oder eben ein Fentanylderivat. 
Dadurch bekam ich dann nachdem ich wegen des Anfalls aufh√∂rte auch Entzugserscheinungen, welche schlimmer waren als das was von Kratom geschildert wird, eben weil ich viele andere Opioide auch im Organismus hatte und diese die Toleranz extrem nach oben getrieben haben.

Es ist mir auch wichtig das eben hervorzuheben, da ich vermute, dass der Beikonsum das Entziehen so unangenehm machte und ich da nicht dem Kratom die Schuld geben m√∂chte.

Und von Benzos hatte ich h√∂chstens einen Rebound-Effekt, das ist kein Entzug sondern mehr sowas wie ein Entzug lite, wenn man √ºber einen kurzen Zeitraum hohe Dosen einnimmt, in meinem Fall 12 St√ºck Alprazolam/""Xanax"" (1mg) und 5 St√ºck Clonazepam (2mg) in 24 Stunden, dann kann es nach Abklingen der Wirkung zu einer unangenehmen Umkehrung der Effekte kommen, also Panik, Unruhe, Schlaflosigkeit. Ich hatte nach der Menger aber auch tagelange Ged√§chtnisl√ºcken, da ich normalerweise nie mehr als 0,5mg Alprazolam bzw Clonazepam nahm zu der Zeit. Aber ein wirklicher Entzug blieb mir zum Gl√ºck erspart.

Ich w√ºrde einen kalten Entzug von Benzos und anderen GABAergen Substanzen wie GHB/GBL/BDO und Alkohol aber generell nicht empfehlen, diese k√∂nnen im schlimmsten Fallen eben auch T√∂dlich enden, wenn man zum Beispiel wie bei Alkohol oder den GHB-Stoffen im ein Delirium f√§llt. Bei Opioiden ist der Entzug gl√ºcklicherweise nur extrem unangenehm, aber eben nicht t√∂dlich.

Wobei ein station√§rer Entzug generell oft anzuraten ist, ist oft besser, viele Leute meinen zwar sie m√ºssen selbst stark genug dazu sein, aber Hilfe anzunehmen ist kein Zeichen von Schw√§che.",22

Gustavo √© diagnosticado com leucemia miel√≥ide aguda (LMA) do subtipo M7 (megacarioc√≠tica).

 Desde que descobriram o diagnostico do pequeno, os pais Taiana e Guilherme Chagas iniciaram uma a√ß√£o atrav√©s do Instagram ([**@unidosporgu**](https://www.instagram.com/unidosporgu/)) com o ""Seja o Super-Heroi do Gu"", com objetivo de encontrar um doador.

 De acordo com a fam√≠lia, atualmente, Gustavo est√° internado no Hospital de C√¢ncer Infantil de Barretos, em S√£o Paulo, mais conhecido como Hospital do Amor. Ele j√° fez 4 ciclos de quimioterapia e quase 30 transfus√µes sangu√≠neas, incluindo hem√°cias e plaquetas.

 Nesta semana o garotinho come√ßou a apresentar sinais de melhoras na sa√∫de gastrointestinal, aceitando melhor a dieta sem a presen√ßa de n√°useas e enjoos, al√©m de diminuir as dores abdominais e as c√≥licas.

Ao encerrar a semana, nosso cora√ß√£o se encheu mais uma vez de alegria e f√©. Fomos chamados pela equipe de transplante do hospital e nos informaram que, dentro do universo de 100 mil doadores, encontramos um anjo que possui a medula 100 % compat√≠vel com a de Gustavinho. E o melhor de tudo: essa pessoa est√° dispon√≠vel para doar amor, doar vida e doar medula √≥ssea para o nosso pequeno. Tivemos a gra√ßa de receber o ""bilhete premiado"" da vida. Gratid√£o se tornou uma palavra pequena para expressar o nosso sentimento. Confia e entrega seus problemas, porque Deus √© bom. Tudo no tempo de Deus! Tem que saber entregar, confiar, orar, louvar e agradecer! Entretanto, a Campanha continua como compromisso nosso... na vida.

He was a career criminal that had a fatal dose of fentenyl in him in addition to meth.  He was OD'ing regardless of if the cops were there or not and he died of cardiac arrest.  As for if it is or is not brutality, I am waitin for the results of the actual trial.  I am hearing that it does meet the guidelines for how to treat people that are resisting arrest.  

Regardless, I am not saying there are zero examples of police brutality, I am saying there are very few.  You do not need one example, you need many.  A total of nine unarmed black men were shot and killed by police in 2019 and most of them clearly attacked the police.  That is far from common.  

The vast majority of these people had a lot of control over what happened.  Nothing was forced on them, their choices brought them to their fate.  The cop would have been happy to have a peaceful shift.

If you do not want to be injured while resisting arrest then do not resist arrest.

If you do not want to be arrested then do not do things that will get you arrested.

As I read it from the autopsy [here](https://www.hennepin.us/-/media/hennepinus/residents/public-safety/documents/floyd-autopsy-6-3-20.pdf). These figures suggest that he took meth and something containing fentenyl within a week of the death, but would not have been under the primary effects during, and several other drugs in the month or year prior. 

**I take it back though. I am wrong** here. Much like I am criticizing you guys for, I don't correct someone without at least some research and sources behind me. 

Apparently in late August another autopsy said that he did have enough of a combination in his system, and because his arteries were heavily clogged, it could have been potentially been fatal. Though death from OD directly is still unlikely.

Still though the only way he could have been actively on anything except cannabis and caffeine at the time of his death is if he were microdosing.",1

If you are worried that your product is pressed and/or contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*



#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.

The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Jokes apart, psychedelic drugs are genuinely incredible in terms of therapeutic effects and uses, every year we come up with new researchs and applications, for example they can greatly help people with a terminal illness to accept their death

We don't know psychedelics well enough because laws get in the way of research, but there is for sure something with them

Keep in mind that lsd and psilocybin (he probably took either one of these or assumed a similiar compound) are the second least dangerous opioids, alcool and smoke included, and when someone famous dies ""for the assumption of psychedelics"" it's always because they consumed either BNoMe (""fake"" lsd, really dangerous) or because they got something filled with fetanyl, like what happened to Lil Peep",2

285,2020-09-16 12:54:15+00:00,"""Raptured"" is not the right word, Elijah ascended to heaven. There are two ascensions in the Hebrew Bible, Enoch in Genesis 5:24 and Elijah in 2 Kings 2:11. The LXX says God ""transfered"" Enoch (ŒºŒµœÑŒ±œÑŒØŒ∏Œ∑ŒºŒπ), Elijah was ""taken away"" (·ºÄŒΩŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩœâ). Neither is the word in 1 Thessalonians which refers to the rapture (1 Thess 4:17, a future passive of Œ±ÃîœÅœÄŒ±ÃÅŒ∂œâ, to snatch, take away). 

According to Jewish tradition Moses ascended to heaven as well (Josephus, *Antiq*. 4.8.48). Ezra has a similar experience in *4 Ezra* 14:49, and Baruch is also ""translated"" in *2 Baruch* 76.2. 

&gt;**2 Baruch 76:1-2** And he answered and said to me: Since the revelation of this vision has been explained to you as you prayed for, hear the word of the Most High that you know that which will happen to you after these things. 2¬†For you will surely depart from this world, nevertheless not to death but to be kept unto (the end) of times.

As for the actual question, I suppose prophets can write letters long before they are dead. Ralph Klein said, ""Since the wording of this letter is characteristic of the Chronicler‚Äôs hand, however, it is widely agreed to be pseudonymous."" *2 Chronicles* (Hermeneia; Fortress, 2012), 307. He also cites a German commentator who points out ""the Chronicler does not say that Elijah sent this letter, but only that this letter came from Elijah."" 

Sara Japhet suggests the Chronicler has a different chronology than Kings:

&gt;Nor does Chronicles ever posit a movement between this world and the next. As for the chronology, it is in fact difficult to date with any precision any of the traditions of Elijah and Elisha as presented in 2 Kings 2, and most especially the moment when Elisha ‚Äòsaw him no more‚Äô. It seems more probable that the Chronicler had a different view of the chronological pattern, which in any case implies a difference of a very few years. Sara Japhet, *I &amp; II Chronicles* (OTL; WJKP, 1993), 812.

This leads to the much more conservative view of J. A. Thompson who comments:

&gt;Hence Elijah was alive during the early years of Jehoram‚Äôs reign, at least during the years of a possible co-regency. Some have questioned the genuineness of a letter from Elijah, since it is not attested elsewhere, but we should be careful about rejecting the testimony of our primary evidence, the Bible. According to 2 Kgs 1:17, Elijah gave a prophecy about the death of Ahaziah and the accession of Jehoram. This suggests that Elijah was alive for part, at least, of Jehoram‚Äôs reign. J. A. Thompson, *1, 2 Chronicles (*NAC 9; Broadman &amp; Holman, 1994), 299.",45

287,2020-09-16 12:12:39+00:00,"If your Suboxone use (buprenorphine/naloxone combination product) was on the lower end of the dosage range (* i.e. 1-4mg), 36hrs. to 48hrs. would tend to allow the bupe's extremely powerful mu-receptor latching to diminish to the point where a relatively weaker medication such as oxycodone will feel pretty much like the full mu-agonist that you are used to...but that is always subjective, so that is not always the case-- but you should get at least 70%-80% of the opioid effect from your Percocet (oxycodone/APAP). Higher dosing of buprenorphine will sometimes affect the wait time (For example, 8mg, or 16mg to 32mg--and b/c bupe is a unique opioid, going above 32mg is a waste (due to it have a ceiling effect around this dosage, as well as dangerous to a novice...b/c only being a partial opioid agonist and modulator, it can still cause extreme respiratory depression being 40-60√ó the potency of mophine!)! The naloxone for say 4mg of Suboxone would theoretically contain ~1mg of naloxone; 8mg/2mg of naloxone-- but unless you are IVing bupe, the naloxone has a negligible oral/sublingual/insufflated (snorting) effect. So, in my experience, it's good to wait 48hrs. as a rule of thumb for mild-to-moderate buprenorphine doses. Hope some of that was helpful!

298,2020-09-15 21:58:14+00:00,"Isto, um truque que a globo usa e abusa s√£o os n√∫cleos, cada novela tem uns 3 ou 4 deles, alguns se cruzam, outros n√£o com isto eles colocam temas variados - entrela√ßados com a historia de amor generica e em geral obrigatoria - fora isto, voc√™ vai ter uns 4 temas discutidos misturados, pense assim:

Temas:

* um tema mais s√©rio para esta novela especifica (o mais s√©rio √© que ser√° mais discutido n√£o que seja s√©rio para a popula√ß√£o) por exemplo um dos personagens principais √© um ex-presidiario inocente que busca vingan√ßa.
* um tema m√©dio-s√©rio j√° que temos um ex-presidiario inocente, vamos por a corrup√ß√£o social onde algu√©m prejudica outro s√≥ pra 'se librar de um empecilio' 
* um outro tema m√©dio-s√©rio, vamos com a sa√∫de da popula√ß√£o numa pandemia
* Outro tema provavelmente seria as fake-news e derivados - como algu√©m ser acusado de algo via rede social e correr o risco de ser preso ou at√© morto.
* um tema mais leve, mas que parte da popula√ß√£o se identifica, vamos com uma garota que tinha chance de ser rainha da bateria mas por causa da pandemia v√™ seu sonho minguar...

N√∫cleos - note que aqui n√£o precisa ser um lugar extremamente separado, mas grupos de locais pr√≥ximos podem ser nucleos distintos:

* uma area mais popular, provavelmente bairro pobre ou favela, onde teremos nosso heroi ex-presidiario e a garota que iria ser a rainha da bateria.
* nucl√©o mais rico, onde teremos o acusador de nosso heroi, algu√©m que acusou ele de um crime para... hum vamos dizer, afasta-lo de sua filha... 
* n√∫cleo criminoso, os caras que o heroi conheceu na cadeia e se propoem a ajuda-lo em sua vingan√ßa desde que ele trabalhe com eles
* n√∫cleo hospitalar, onde teremos personagens que cruzam com os dos demais grupos e falam sobre a pandemia

Clich√™s:

* em geral um ou dois casais apaixonados que enfrentam problemas de graus diferentes, a filha do empres√°rio se casou com outro mas √© infeliz e no fundo ainda ama nosso heroi, do outro lado a quase rainha da bateria com algu√©m que canta ela...
* o empresario (ou nem lembrando do cara, mas percebendo algo errado em suas empresas, ou sabendo que o cara quer vingan√ßa e tentando atacar primeiro)
* o criminoso importante, falando em ajudar nosso heroi, mas primeiro precisa que ele fa√ßa algo (que por alguma raz√£o) nosso heroi √© perfeito para fazer... vamos dizer que ele √© mergulhador e o cara quer que ele transporte armas pela costa...
* um cara confuso para servir de 'comic relief' 
* um policial ou jornalista que desconfia do empresario mas n√£o tem provas e √© cercado por corruptos que apoiam o empres√°rio
* um conservador - seja um militar, ex-politico, viuva, etc que vai ser contra o heroi por principio que 'se esteve na cadeia √© culpado' e contra o n√∫cleo hospitalar (talvez aqui aproveitassem e colocassem o risco das fake news para ajudar a modernizar a historia da novela)

Aqui temos, os dois primeiros temas j√° tiveram variantes em duzias de novelas, as vezes a globo faz algo diferente para chamar a aten√ß√£o, como por exemplo no final da Vale Tudo onde o corrupto fugia do pa√≠s, mas em geral vamos ter a conclus√£o padr√£o - o heroi ser√° inocentado, sem ter feito nada errado para o grupo criminoso. Dos n√∫cleos todos eles j√° apareceram em alguma novela - √© claro que o hospitalar seria mais algo com um personagem importante doente ou algo similar - como Barriga de Aluguel.

E assim vai, lava, enxagu√°, troca alguns detalhes e vamos novamente... o que a globo e seus autores sabem bem √© dosar os 'temas originais' no meio de suas novelas trocando o background mas mantendo em praticamente todas uma historia de amor que √© o principal atrativo para elas. √â claro que isto √© mais para a novela das 8 que √© a principal, a das 7 pode ser - e em geral √© - mais 'livre' mas segue alguns destes padr√µes.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Then the percocet 30s hit my area after high school and those kids that couldn't afford them regularly went to herioin and either died, or somehow got lucky. I've seen people cut open phentanyl patches and eat the liquid with a q-tip for fun. This would normally kill a few people and little girls were doing this shit and doing it regularly on weekends. These girls are still alive. I live in a pretty hard hit state, one of the hardest actually. I was at every party if it wasn't at my house in a university city. Family, hs gf, good friends from diapers and so on were on it all and I was a lucky one. All the rich kids even were on pills. I always hid the fact I had kidney issues and always seen the pain pills as medicine that helps me, not something I wanted to feel for fun. No one knew I was getting them prescribed to me for the better. Most of the people that are walking around my state are now on subboxone or the like. I've helped many of my friends with a place to stay and food to eat bc I always had a stable job and had an apartment. Trust me, I could go on and on and on. The deaths and all that has calmed down over the last few years but I know over 30 people that I considered friends that died from it. Wealthy (went to hs with fortune 500 founders children) or not.

339,2020-09-13 21:55:07+00:00,"Well, i do not condone any of the actions i have taken so here‚Äôs my experience with benadryl ( theres a lot ). 
i had known of hallucinating and being high on it for awhile before i tried it. My best friend had been taking it pretty consistently and had a few nightmares, yet he continued to use. Until like a year later when my now x was tripping on it at parties i had no desire to. With little to no knowledge at the time my first trip was way too much to consume, coupled with alcohol caffeine and sedatives ( bad bad bad idea ). Started the night with upwards of 14 of the 25mg, and God knows of how much NyQuil, Redbull, 24oz beer and probably 15mg of Oxycotin. Whence we, my x and one other friend, went to the shed to smoke pot i had got the first signs of the trip. i looked at the floorboards of the shed and the wood seemed to flow like liquid, while still being flat, under my friends feet. I was pretty exited for the night by now and had no idea of the severity to come. As soon as that started I personally hadn‚Äôt noticed but i was loosing everything and couldn‚Äôt remember where shit was. Took about 30 mins searching for my phone which was either in my hand or pocket for us to be able to leave to go to my friends house. Total delirium set in by the time we got there, i had no idea of it though. The rest is impossible for me to remember the order of events because i was crazy at that point. We spent a lot of time swimming in his pool talking, playing games.. or atleast trying to. During 3 flys in i not only forgot that i was playing, had the ball in my hand but also that i only have one x. i was up against 3 of her so i lost pretty badly. Her aunt who wasn‚Äôt there cheered me on from under the carport :) She was also the only one who looked at the fleet of ufo‚Äôs i pointed out :/ when we tried to play categories it was more like watch me stand confused about how to play the game and what game it was. After several minutes of me being utterly unable to conjure a rational thought the other two gave up on me and had the grand idea of just combining every game we could think of so if i guessed wrong they could still participate. Although a grand idea for them to just accommodate by that time i was forgetting i was in the pool. When i closed my eyes at times i thought we were in the car going somewhere... in the freaking pool. Well after awhile of that we decided to go for a walk and dry off. i attempted to gather my phone, nicotine etc. but there were multiples of everything on the ground everywhere. I bashed my hand up a bit trying to grab the nothing that was on the ground. 
On the walk tree limbs were jumping like you‚Äôd kinda see a limb move if a monkey jumped off of it. There were no monkeys though. 
At some point I‚Äôm not sure when we were in the Walmart Parking lot waiting for.. idk. but while there those scooter things that elderly or disabled people use were floating across the asphalt that was also moving in  every-which direction. light poles were constantly rising out of the ground and floating, more jumpy trees too. I saw a lot of my friends that weren‚Äôt there too. 
During some point in the car with my x, who had now been driving for awhile because i was incapable, she was begging crying to me to talk to her which i thought i was but apparently wasn‚Äôt. I hallucinated her talking to me a lot in the car, and she was also in the backseat. I also thought there were just thousands of frogs in the road and she was driving over so many and killing them so i got pretty upset, she had asked me whats wrong and for some reason i replied with ‚Äúi dont know why Mrs.TeacherName is fat!‚Äù pretty hilarious. 
I‚Äôm not sure how but I could‚Äôve swore we had drove to my house and spent the night there because i had asked her to get the strangers out of the guest room where i had planned to sleep. Either way, I woke up at her house and THEN the scary part happened. 

In considerably large doses, or mixed with sedatives Diphenhydramine absolutely decimates your CNS and H1 / H2 receptors in the brain. H1 i believe is where you get the delirium from but H2 is for your organs ( i might be incorrect ) With the dosage that I took the effects became near fatal. I could not focus my eyes, everything was blurry, my heart beat irrationally and fast, breathing was not only more difficult due to the absurd lethargy but also due to me being unable to do it without fluttering. I was trembling terribly with every other motor action as well so we soon had my parents come pick me up and take me to the hospital. They gave me fluid I.V. and within 15 minutes of flushing all of it out via urinating i recovered pretty fast. Since then I‚Äôve had HPPD and just saw walls, any flat surface really, move around. I probably would‚Äôve recovered from that if I hadn‚Äôt continued recreational use just WAY less. 
‚ÄúWhy in the hell would you keep using it after that!?‚Äù as some might ask and i do say, it incapacitates thinking enough for me to avoid feeling depressed. Now like 2 years later it makes me forget where things are but the body feel of it is addictive. Feeling very cold, shaking, and fast heart pace didn‚Äôt bother me as much with muscle relaxation and funnily enough an almost physical euphoria. 
Also, the daily use I usually consume is about 400mg daily. 200mg in the morning and afternoon. I expect to start being senile by 45 because out of the corner of my eyes i often see people walking past, and very seldom hear voices even while on a 200mg dose. 
My friend hears voices more often than I, yet him not experiencing a near death amount.

And again, I'm not claiming that it gets you as high as pushing 100 mg of Diamorphin.

Which is kinda why it's so bloody dangerous: You can get your tolerance to the high up high enough with Oxycodone or heroin that the methadone dose required for the same high would be far above the dose that kills you through respiratory depression.",3
353,2020-09-13 15:14:27+00:00,"What the hell? I'm a pharmacist.

Methadon absolutely gets you high. But not when you are taking the prescribed dose appropriate to your tolerance.


That's what happens with every opioid.

Do you think a random pain patient getting the appropriate dose of oxycodon is continuously getting high?


You can even try it yourself. Skip two days and take the same dose as before and there'll be euphoria most assuredly.


You are spreading the same outdated bullshit that the manufacturers of every new opioid drug bring. 

They said the same thing about diamorphin when it replaced morphine.


Every mu-agonist will get you high at a high enough dose, that's just what agonism of the mu receptor does.



Obviously someone in a methadone substitution program doesn't get high from taking the same 10 mg dose every single day.

That same thing happens with bloody heroin programs. 

That's why addicts use more and more of the drug. Because the tolerance to the drug prevents the same dose from causing the wanted high.

This property isn't any different for methadone or any other regular mu agonist.",2

355,2020-09-13 13:22:14+00:00,"Uhm, methadone absolutely does get you high.

Just not if you are already opioid dependent.



And Methadone and alcohol are no worse than combining any other opioid with ethanol. It's not a good idea, but a glass of wine will have absolutely no effect as long as you are taking the same dose of methadone you've taken for a while.


Methadone is widely available on the blackmarket from people selling their prescription on. So clearly there's more than enough drug seekers for methadone.




And Oxycodon or Heroin or any other opioid at the dose appropriate for your pain also doesn't make you sluggish long term.

There's chronic pain patients on the 100mcg Fentanyl patch doing just fine.



Sure the high from Heroin is preferable to most addicts, but again methadone absolutely gets you high at the equivalent dose that heroin or Oxycodone would get you high.",2

Sold for $7,869 in March 2020. Antiquorum incorrectly lists this as 1966; this would really be more like 1956. Most 6609's have lume, but I like the clean look of the unlumed hands and dial on this one.

***Turn-O-Graph timeline:***

[1952-1953: Ref. 6202 debuts, the first Turn-O-Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/rolex/comments/792vsz/cool_rolex_of_the_day_6202_turnograph_the/). While the steel model resembles the soon-to-be-released Submariner, [the two-tone model has a gold bezel that most associate with the later ""Thunderbird"" models](https://i.imgur.com/3dxk1KR.png).


[1953-1956: Ref. 6309 ditches the Sub-style bezel in favor of the gold ""Thunderbird"" one](https://i.imgur.com/2eryNeC.png). [Full gold is now an option](https://i.imgur.com/gvlnL7E.png), as is a [left-hand crown](https://i.imgur.com/NJHeMcA.png).


**[1956-1959: Ref. 6609 is ""basically the same as 6309 but with updated 1065 movement (based on the cal. 1030 but with date)](https://i.imgur.com/ftjj7xh.jpg)"" [accordin](https://www.rolexforums.com/showthread.php?t=142116)[g to adam78](http://archive.is/q20fd). This is the model that sparked the nickname ""Thunderbird"" because [Rolex famously gifted some to the USAF Thunderbirds](http://rolexpassionreport.com/6520/the-rolex-thunderbird-of-usaf-captain-maultsby/).**


[1957: Ref. 6602, a rare Datejust model called the ""Transcontinental,""](https://i.imgur.com/wqjiLm4.jpg) is the only Rolex ever made with a 12-hour rotating bezel afaik. My apologies to u/eyeis who [posted this one here years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rolex/comments/4xx8ax/help_identifying_the_exact_model_of_this_57/); I was dismissive and assumed it was fake. Some assume 6609 is the correct model number because there is also the entirely different [6602 moonphase](https://i.imgur.com/0Ue7Un5.jpg). [Sotheby's cal](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2019/important-watches/rolex-ref-6609-6602-transcontinental-a-stainless)[ls it a ""6602/6609""](http://archive.is/fBuAG) but 6602 is what's actually engraved on the case in every known instance. Here's a [TRF thread a](https://www.rolexforums.com/showthread.php?p=7702840)[bout another example](http://archive.is/wip/ZlySY).


[1959-1976: Ref. 1625 gets a movement upgrade to the Caliber 1500 series](https://i.imgur.com/zxWCDNP.png). At first it sports a 1565 movement, with 26 jewels vibrating at 5 beats per second. Starting in 1965, the 25-jewel 1575 movement ups the rate to 5.5 beats per second while increasing the power reserve from 42 to 48 hours.


[1977-1987: Ref. 16250/16253/16258 gets a movement upgrade to Caliber 3035](https://i.imgur.com/fdip1Vz.png), now vibrating at 8 beats per second like modern Rolexes do.


[1988 - 2003: Ref. 16263/16264 gets upgraded to a sapphire crystal and Caliber 3135 movement](https://i.imgur.com/HzjtJsW.png). No more full gold models.


[2004-2011: Ref. 116261/116263/116264 gets a more modern case, new bezel design, and Caliber 3135](https://i.imgur.com/CLA4Ccg.png). Rose gold + steel is a new option. Small numbers of a [special edition with a green seconds hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/rolex/comments/7lv418/cool_rolex_of_the_day_116263_turnograph_with/) mysteriously hit Japan in 2011, and a few European AD's a couple years later (though for some reason they have 2005 serial numbers).",3

There's usually very good reasons a specific drug formulations is packed the way it is.

Take for example Oxycodon: It also doesn't use regular blisters but rather peel blisters, because they are even more child proof than regular blisters which are more childproof than child safe bottles.

Navy seal was a tragedy but nothing compared blunders caused by Obama when in office, being responsible for creation of ISIS and other offshoots from Taliban by leaving a power vacuum when it could've been ended once and for all, nobody had to die after that if he just did it right for once, It was Trump who has been fixing his misdeeds with ending the ISIS and being a diplomat instead of a warmonger that Obama was, Trump is the first US president to step in North Korea, was responsible for Israel-UAE peace deal, yet he got ridiculed for it as if the left wants our children to due in the battlefields.

388,2020-09-11 21:27:10+00:00,"I realize that pain treatment is a double edged sword right now, but the opioid epidemic is not new. You're right.  It's a shitshow. But we don't have to add to it by not treating.

We will have to disagree that giving 10/10 pain opioids is doing harm. If pain is truly 10/10, you are not harming someone by treating it. Full stop. Especially in an inpatient setting where treatment is monitored. You are causing harm by not treating it. And. . .I've seen a lot of that over the last couple years.   The real harm comes from prescribing it to take home and not offering ways to taper or any follow up.  The harm does not come from treating in  clinical setting.

Pain will always be subjective. If we no longer weigh their subjective pain score into the equation, why even bother documenting it?  Its not up to us to decide if a patient is lying. Patients who laugh with a friend, constantly scroll through their phones, smile through it etc. are using coping methods like distraction and fawning. I remember when I showed up at an ER with a MRSA infection in both breasts., I rocked, smiled and played games on my phone constantly. It was Christmas.  I couldn't even hug my kids. Walking was excrucitaing. God forbid I ask for something for the pain without getting side eye. I mentioned that I usually don't tolerate vicodin without barfing. The ER nurse brought me Norco and insisted that it was a completely different drug and that I wouldn't be offered anything else. Motherfucker had left by the time I puked it up. 

If you smoke weed, you deserve pain treatment.
If you have a drug hx, you deserve pain treatment. 
If you have to have your herioin injection site surgically cleaned up. . .you deserve a hell of a lot of pain treatment. 

If you are elderly, demented, homeless, a psych patient, an endometriosis surgical patient. . .you deserve to have your pain treated. If you are a middle aged woman showing up in the ER with a broken ankle, don't let the fuckimg ER resident talk you out of pain meds because the ""risks outweigh the benefits"".

7. I agree it could have been. We just don't know, because we don't know Floyd's personal tolerance. Most fentenyl overdoses of habitual users involve blood levels 4 times higher on average than what was found in Floyd's system. 

What I do know is that Chauvin acted in complete disregard to Floyd's life and contributed to Floyd's death by kneeling on his unconscious body for over 5 minutes. That alone makes him quantifiably guilty of 2nd degree manslaughter.",1

I'm going to venture that you didn't actually watch the bodycam video where he was saying ""I can't breathe"" well before he was on the ground (by the way, Floyd requested to lay on the ground). He was also foaming at the mouth, a clear sign of opiate overdose.",1
401,2020-09-11 14:53:55+00:00,"Thats because you are letting emotions make decisions for you instead of just being practical.  Had this whole thing never made the news, had tens of thousands of wild blacks not rioted and looted and broke glass and stole tennis shoes and burned down target or whatever; and its just 3 guys being accused of the death of a crackhead they say was resisting, the toxicology proves that. Pause there, he had enough fentayl and methamphetamine to kill you and I combined.   

1. Floyd had probably 50 times to been told to get in the car and stop fighting them, that would have ended it. Thats backed up by the 2 others in the vehicle who didn't fight and didn't end in a fight with cops.  The cops didn't want to fight, George did.      -prosecution will have to overcome this somehow? Had the cops whipped all 3 in the car and acted like fuckers to all 3 people even those complying, this would be different.  The cops and the other vehicle occupants were polite with each other even, many yes sirs, no sirs, both directions.   I think that removes the idea that the cops rolled up with intent on killing someone.  

2. Floyd was non-compliant from the first interaction. 

3. He was clearly ,even to untrained people, severely intoxicated on something.  One of the cops asks another cop is he on PCP? Look at his eyes going back and forth.  You know they've been trained and heard stories about people on pcp essentially going full zombie mode ape shit.  They don't want him biting a chunk out of them.  He is bigger than they are, he's intoxicated, it took two of them to cuff him.  Floyd is clearly a threat to any reasonable person at this point even cuffed, even more so pulling away and struggling.

4. When they try to get him in the car floyd asks for the window to be rolled down, the cops do it.  They are still trying to calm him to get him in the car.  If your intentions are to kill him why roll down the window?  Why adjust the seat belts where he can fit in the car? -again this would throw out any charges of intentional murder charges.

5. When he came out of the car and went on the ground and the cops got on top of him he was fighting like a mad man, still.  I saw at least a few full length leg kicks until what maybe 3 guys got on top of him.  This is what after a 15 minute argument with the cops and refusal to comply with literally anything.  He had to be forced to do everything.  Shit they had to put a gun to his head to put his hands on the wheel.  Two guys had to manhandle him to cuff him,  two or 3 guys had to drag him for every movement.  BUT, now he's on the ground, and still fighting.   They've called the ambulance, im assuming with a gurny with full restraints to strap him to.

6. A few bad things.... 1. The call they put in to the ambulance wasn't for elevated emergency status, so it just drove there normally, no lights or sirens.  This caused it to take 5 or 6 minutes longer to get there.  -maybe the one in charge that made the call saw the guy wasn't in immediate risk of death, wasn't bleeding out or actually dying at the time whatever thats how the call went in....2. The we floyd came out of the car and went down and the way the cops came down on top of him wasnt ideal for either parties.  They weren't practicing in a gym on a mat.  They were real world, real scenario, real crackhead, real car, real positioning.  This is how they ended up when they went down.  Floyd is subdued, cops are not being bit,punched,stabbed,kicked whatever, seems good, hold it until the ambulance gets here.  -i understand their logic.  Floyd has been screaming all sorts of random shit including he can't  breathe since he was in his on car. So I get why they ignored anything he said at that point....3. The next few minutes of staying on him whilst he died, yeah its definitely bad and doesn't look good and isn't really defensible; other than him saying i didn't know I was killing him, I didn't intend to kill him.  His drug abuse played a significant major role in his death - I dont think you'll have a hard time finding a expert M.D. to testify to that.  I honestly believe Chauvin is just as much as fault I his death as the drug overdose and non compliance are.  How do you quantify that out in court with no emotion and strict adherence to the laws  - I dont know.  

Now the other cops.  The rookies not really in control of anything.  I dont see them individually doing anything illegal.  Walking the perimeter keeping nosy peanut head blacks from bepoppin through the struggle isn't really warranting of them being charged with anything, they probbaly do that at every crime scene they go to.  Write down names, date of births of people involved, almost clerical shit, you saw his little notebook he has pages of shit like that in it.  The ones holding his feet and arms are just trying not kicked in the face until the ambulance gets there.  I assure you they don't care about this crackhead or the next one they have to arrest 2 hours from now. It is what is.  Move to the next one, its a job.  Zero intentions of killing floyd, tbh I garantee you their only intention was holding him down until the ambulance got there so he can be someone else problem.  No malice there for the rookies.",1
402,2020-09-11 14:42:06+00:00,"I quite vividly remember thinking ""this is what the love I never got as a child must feel like"" after the hospital dosed me Oxycotin. 

Later that day, when I eventually left the hospital, they wrote me a prescription for pain killers.  I went to the pharmacy to fill out the prescription where I suddenly was struck with the most agonizing wave of shivers and chills throughout my whole body‚Äîwhich I now understand was opioid withdrawal. I spent the next 2 weeks pill popping multiple times a day to medicate for the pain, but also for the ""high"" of feeling that warm motherly embrace I never knew that I missed before.

After the end of that 2 week period, I never touched any prescription pain killers again, but I knew in my heart that everything about my trauma, my abusive childhood, and my life tragedies had primed me to be an opioid addict.

It was a very jarring 14 day experience, which gave me a small insight into how addictions are manifestations of mental health problems, and a small sliver of the crippling withdrawal that comes with opioid abuse.

This is only a personal anecdote, but it is one I try to give often when talking about addictions with different folks.",1

You're right. The US does have a fucked up rate for those who make 45K a year. It seems to be the same 20% income tax for both countries. However, if you make less than 40K or over 120K, you're good. I guess the true benefit of being in America is you have a much better chance of making over 100K a year than you do in Scotland. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But why does America have an opioid crisis then? It‚Äôs not just capitalism, here doctors won‚Äôt give you medication if you don‚Äôt absolutely need it as they have no reason to, in America the doctors places of work make money so there‚Äôs incentive to give things out. I‚Äôm not saying American doctors give it out unjustly, just that they have no incentive to wait and see, or to see if things heal themselves etc. 

I would argue this is freedom. I've been prescribed oxycotin, an opioid, after surgery (like most people are prescribed) and choose to take it as needed. It worked like a charm, as I was in so much pain without it that I couldn't move. In Scotland they'd probably tell me to just rest and that I don't need to move. Anyway, that was 3 years ago and I still have most of the pills left in the bottle, sitting in my medicine cabinet. If you abuse the drugs, you are abusing your freedom. And yeah maybe the doctors don't have incentive to wait but they also aren't forcing anything on the patient or not giving not the option. You could stack a million prescriptions from doctors and not fill one of them, so I'll take options over no option.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Having lived in Scotland I can tell you I never have to wait to see a GP more than a week or so, and my shoulder surgery had a waiting time of a month as it wasn‚Äôt life threatening it was just a growth slightly limiting mobility. 

That's great for you but like I said it may have more to do with population density.

Many cities in America are very densely populated. Take Los Angeles or New York City for example. They would be completely fucked.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Regarding police we have little to no aggressors with guns so I can‚Äôt directly compare that stat, but as I say, we view our police like we view traffic wardens or ambulance drivers etc, at least where I live there‚Äôs no fear or suspicion of them. 

That is nice for Scotland, but in the USA we need our guns to maintain freedom. If someone just comes into our home then we need a proper way to defend ourselves. This freedom extends to all classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I can‚Äôt talk for how easy those final things are as it‚Äôs subjective, but I used to work in oil where 150k salaries were fairly common place. I now work in the government so earn significantly less than I did, but I get like 45 paid vacation days a year, don‚Äôt work Fridays, and have zero work stress!

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

It requires large amounts of the drug to be present on your skin for large amounts of time.

2014, it's my third day on the way back to work after xmas break, I am two streets from were I live and some old fart reading a paper goes through the stop sign and T-Bones me. My neck is now fucked again. Lost my career as a welder.

Got lawyered up and that was a nightmare, started drinking 3/4 of bottle of wild turkey daily, 3 grams of pot, pack of ciggies, codiene, liquid morhine, oxycodone and tramadol to name a few.

I got a call in 2017 from my lawyer saying I won the case. Got on the mixture and had some bad pains in my arm and neck, I didn't worry about it due to the permanent nerve damage from accident. Next morning I was driving to get pot, 2 hour drive. I get to my mates and the pains are back again, I get my smoke and drive home, halfway back home and it's happening again.

I made it home and had to rush off for oestotherapy for my nerve damage, I tell my Osteo lady what's been going on, She demands I get a blood test before leaving. Two hours later the hospital calls to tell me I've had 3 heart attacks, I was in hospital that night.

They did a triple by-pass but it couldn't be that easy, two days later my lungs had filled with blood, open that chest again to drain the blood out. Slowly start to recover and as I'm looking good one morning I woke and the whole bed was red, the needle in my main vein come out at night, 2 blood transfusions later.

The bottom part of my heart died, also some of my patience when dealing with people. I do have a supporting wife of 23 years and 3 awesome kids. Besides them, Reddit is as social as I get. Sorry for the long story.",1

These are all major red flags on his side. Its not that he smokes weed, it sounds like he's abusing it (and other drugs). Responsible pot smokers aren't neglectful of themselves, others, or obligations on account of their pot usage. Being distant and lacking affection aren't common traits of the many \[adult\] users I know. 

Moderating his usage by you becoming a smoker is faulty logic at best. It wont work. He has to *want* to moderate. You participating with him will likely only encourage the habit. Im totally on board with weed though you sound too young and ill-informed about it to be able to use it safely and responsibly at this point. I would highly encourage counseling instead.

Tbh you seem codependent. Thats not a character assault btw; its unsurprising given that you cant turn to your parents for support and happens all the time to great ppl. It should be addressed though or you'll continue to do things for others that you dont really want to do and accept behavior that makes you feel bad bc you're reliant on them emotionally.

Entre as que conheciam o segredo, certamente n√£o estavam os executivos da Marvel e da Disney, que se veem, no momento, diante de um desafio ao mesmo tempo imenso e delicado: como lidar com a sequ√™ncia de um filme que movimentou mais um bilh√£o de d√≥lares em 2018 sem o seu principal astro?

 **Despedida:**[Carta ao Rei T‚ÄôChalla](https://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/2274-carta-ao-rei-tchalla-24614316)

Uma reportagem do site ""Hollywood Reporter"" conta bastidores de como as empresas t√™m lidado com a perda repentina de Boseman. Os executivos da Marvel e da Disney souberam de sua condi√ß√£o por e-mail, apenas uma hora antes do an√∫ncio de sua morte. Segundo a reportagem, uma semana antes de sua morte, Boseman ainda acreditava que se recuperaria para participar do filme - o ator conviveu em sil√™ncio com um c√¢ncer no c√≥lon por quatro anos, per√≠odo em que atuou em dez filmes, entre eles o longa da Marvel e as comentadas cinebiografias de Jackie Robinson e James Brown. 

O vazio deixado pelo ator √© concreto e inescap√°vel. Sua morte impacta diretamente o universo Marvel, j√° que o Rei T‚ÄôChalla, alter ego do Pantera Negra, tinha participa√ß√µes escritas para mais filmes interconectados, a exemplo do que j√° havia acontecido em ‚ÄúCapit√£o Am√©rica: Guerra Civil‚Äù, ‚ÄúVingadores: Guerra Infinita‚Äù e ‚ÄúVingadores: Ultimato‚Äù. Na agenda de produ√ß√£o, as filmagens de ‚ÄúPantera Negra 2‚Äù estavam previstas para mar√ßo de 2021.

At√© agora, por√©m, ningu√©m na Disney ou na Marvel se manifestou al√©m do luto pela morte de Boseman. Isso n√£o apaga a quest√£o, que tamb√©m foi abordada pela revista ‚ÄúForbes‚Äù h√° uma semana. ‚ÄúQuando Robin Williams morreu, seis anos atr√°s, havia pouco a fazer a n√£o ser lamentar e celebrar seus melhores trabalhos. Mas caras como Carrie Fisher, Paul Walker e, sim, Chadwick Boseman est√£o de fato ligados a uma franquia espec√≠fica em andamento que provavelmente continuar√° ap√≥s sua morte‚Äù, constatou o artigo.

 Ao citar outras outras mortes repentinas - Carrie Fischer em ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù, Paul Walker em ‚ÄúVelozes e Furiosos‚Äù - o texto nos lembra como elas impactaram suas respectivas franquias. E que, de uma forma ou outra, elas seguiram em frente. A quest√£o ser√° como fazer isso em ‚ÄúPantera Negra 2‚Äù, principalmente diante da como√ß√£o de milh√µes de f√£s em todo o mundo traumatizados com a morte do √≠dolo. A Ag√™ncia Reuters ouviu escritores, acad√™micos e ativistas sobre isso, e eles acreditam que Marvel e Disney deveriam ‚Äúhonrar o legado de Boseman‚Äù no enredo da sequ√™ncia. 

‚ÄúEles realmente deveriam considerar seguir o enredo das HQs e levar Letitia Wright (a atriz que interpreta Shuri, a irm√£ genial de T‚ÄôChalla) ao papel central‚Äù, opinou o redator s√™nior da Rolling Stone Jamil Smith.

Para Scott Mendelson, autor do artigo da Forbes, o derradeiro papel de Boseman j√° est√° escrito. ‚ÄúO que quer que aconte√ßa, Boseman ter√° seu lugar ao lado de James Dean e Bruce Lee. √â cruelmente ir√¥nico que sua curta vida agora seja o tema dos grandes filmes biogr√°ficos.‚Äù

In any case, the pain therapy that your girlfriend is taking is far from optimal, certainly if it is supposed to be a minimal invasive surgery (however I am aware that these are common medication regimens in the US). First she should drop the Valium, as it hasn‚Äôt got any analgesic effects by itself - and might slow revalidation. Second, does she take paracetamol or any kind of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? These two should be part of the basic analgesic regimen after back surgery. Third, has she got any effect from the oxycodon? If the dose is escalating, there is a high chance of tolerance and addiction. And fourth, how long does she take the gabapentine? Was it from before the surgery?

When he overdosed on fentinyl sitting in the back of the cop car it wouldn't have been the cops fault. I suggest you read the autopsy report. There's no way they get the cop for anything more than manslaughter at most. 

Breonna Taylor, was a tragic accident. However, contrary to the media narrative, the police were not at the wrong house, the warrant was for her house. She was involved in drug trafficking as shown by recorded jail phone calls. The police did in fact knock and announce themselves when serving this no nock warrant. Ms Taylor's boyfriend opened fire at the police and they returned fire, tragically striking Ms Taylor and killing her. The police didn't do anything wrong in this case as they followed procedure and we're in the correct place attempting to serve a warrant for people present at that address. The police will not be found guilty of any charges.

I suggest you do some research as to what actually happened instead of believing the first story shouted by whomever in the media.

15 minutes prior to Floyd being put on the ground: he's acting erratic and fighting the cops.

8 minutes prior to being put on the ground: he's yelling he can't breathe while attempting to be put in the back of the car, still fighting the cops.

5 minutes prior to being put on the ground: he demands to be put on the ground instead of in the car, still yelling he can't breathe. Still fighting and kicking the cops.

The coroner found 3x the lethal dose of Fetanyl in his system. A Fentanyl overdose causes the body to not be able to breathe, hence him calling out he can't breathe prior to be put on the ground.

Because he kept ""calling wolf"" on not being able to breathe, the officers had no idea if he was able to or not, since he was still talking the whole time it's apparent he can breathe. Did they act negligently? More than likely. Did they act intentionally? No, they accepted the request of Floyd to be put on the ground. 

His death wasn't intentional, just negligent. And the facts as we know them don't point to a Murder 2 charge. He's going to get off.

524,2020-09-05 15:57:37+00:00,"Because ""Just pull up your pants"" completely ignores the realities of how we got into this situation.

Consider the 1980s crack epidemic - in the 1980s [the CIA trafficked *kilos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_involvement_in_Contra_cocaine_trafficking) of Cocaine into the United States in order to make some individuals wealthy. This created a huge amount of addicts in mainly poorer/black areas and completely destroyed family units. You have kids growing up with their parents as literal dead beats (not unlike the heroin problem today), and being forced to turn to ""alternatives"" (aka crime) for things like basic necessitates like food and social order.  Worse still instead of seeing it as a social problem (like Heroin is today) it's treated as crime problem and many people you know are simply thrown in jail and racially profiled.

So now lets say you were born at the height of the epidemic - you may have been 25 when this aired. This is what happened to you:

* A state funded actor flooded your community with drugs
* Your parents were completely unwilling and unable to take care of you
* You may have had to drop out of school just to provide for yourself and your siblings
* Members in your community turned to selling drugs to make a living (after all the fucking CIA is delivering it)
* Many of your friends were killed and/or jailed
* After the crack dried up, you have no marketable skills (as a result of you not going to school).

Then you turn on CNN one day and there's a guy telling all your problems would have been solved if you just pulled your pants up. Do you see now why people would be a little offended at his tirade? The baggy pants, the disrespect for the environment, the lack of education are all *symptoms* of a larger problem that the government largely refused to address and take responsibility for. 

It's like telling blaming Grandma in the midwest for getting hooked on heroin and telling her to ""stop being a junkie"" when Purdue was out there pouring millions into doctor's pockets to over prescribe Oxycotin.

Sure, I get it, at some level people are individually responsible for their actions - but can you really say that you would have had the same life if the CIA had inadvertently destroyed your hometown? Yes there are stories of people beating all odds, but a better story would be if the United States wasn't actively destroying it's own communities to fund another war in the middle east.",1

?

I dont know about eric garner but in the case of George floyd at least that *probably* wasn't it chief. 

If our chests were that fragile to pressure we would be a much more screwed species. George died due to a heart attack basically from the excited delirium state, Fetanyl (or some other Methamphetamine) in his system. Did the chokeholds and pressure contribute to his death? Probably. But to say them trying to hold down a man in a drug fueled Excited delirium was the ultimate cause of his death is disingenuous at best. I don't remember either of the like 3 or 4 autopsy reports stating George had multiple broken ribs and or shredded/heavily bruised lungs from the officers applying pressure on his ribs.

I don't think one cop alone can reliably hold down a man in excited Delirium. Theres a reason why the cops have specific protocols in place to deal with people in these sort of suspected states. And it just so happened George actually was on drugs at the time... one infamous for killing people with little more then a dash in their bloodstream.

531,2020-09-05 09:39:17+00:00,"TLDR: Even with the Floyd case, I don't see a problem with the system.  
With all the public outrage, do you think these officers are even going to get a fair trial? Do you even think there is a chance they are innocent?  
Now, I'm going to preface this by saying what happened to Floyd is tragic. I don't want anyone to die. Now, let me ask you something, have you seen the police body cam? I suggest you watch it in it's entirety instead of listening to some guy on the internet. During the confrontation, Floyd was hysterical. The officer drew his gun at the beginning, which he shouldn't have done, but then things calmed down. The officers were very polite and did try to accommodate Floyd. But he kept resisting. The officer's weren't roughing him up or anything. They finally get him in the police car and while he is inside and while no one is really holding him he claims ""I can't breathe"". Floyd then tells the officers to just PUT HIM ON THE GROUND AND HOLD HIM THERE. You then look at autopsy reports saying he had a high level of fentenyl in his system and he had underlying heart problems and cause of death wasn't asphyxiation.  
You can believe the autopsy report or not but just based on the video evidence alone I doubt you're going to get any murder charge to stick, which is what I think they were trying to get the officers for. They over prosecuted. At most this is possibly a manslaughter charge but even that's hard to go for if you believe the autopsy report.   
That's my opinion on the matter. Again , watch the video and look at all the evidence for yourself then draw your own conclusions.",1

Scarification? I don't really know where the line is.

As a frame of reference, a friend of mine has done a piece where at one point she made a cut in her skin to draw blood and work with it. She has no history of self harm and outside of that piece has never deliberately harmed herself. You might say it's technically self harm, but it didn't make her someone who self harms, and it didn't give her any insight to what it's like for me dealing with that urge. Does that context make it different? I've had dimorphine from a needle, but I wouldn't say I've tried shooting heroin.

Mi analisis social, economico y cultural es que colombia en sus areas urbanas en uno de los paises de latinoamerica que logr√≥ obtener algo de bienestar y libertad cultural y economica para sus ciudadanos, estar en las zonas mas desarroladas de las ciudades mas urbanas y pobladas del pais es muy igual a todas las demas ciudades del mundo occidental, sobre todo a las estado unidenses, por ejemplo bogota, cali, medellin, new york, los angeles, miami comparten estas caracteristicas:
Zona downtown llena de clubes nocturnos de todos los generos, gentrificacion, calles dedicadas a la venta de heroina, pastillas, bazuco, cannabis barato, barrios llenos de gente con mucho dinero, barrios humildes de gente trabajadora, si te distraes y bajas tu guardia te pueden robar en cualquier lugar, o te pueden dar roofies y despertar en un parque sin tus pertenencias, o conocer gente muy parecida a ti y conectar mucho y hacer amigos para toda la vida, hay comunidades grandes dedicadas a musica electronica underground y no falta el mdma y las otras party drugs, hay red light district, hay barrios marginados donde mucha gente vive sin hogar

Hay mucho de que hablar y no se si te interesa mi manera de representar esto, soy nacido en cali y llevo 19 a√±os viviendo aca, asi que si te interesa me dices y con mucho gusto te puedo hablar mas

I watched both my parent suffer so much while dying from cancer. 

When my dad died in '95 they could barely do anything to manage his pain, his vains all collapsed so they couldn't inject morphine  and he couldn't swallow.  It was devastating on all of us to watch. 

When my mom died 13 years later it was a bit different. They were allowed to put in a pic line so they were able to continue to administer mophine. 
The more pain, the more morphine, the more morphine the quicker death will come. They also took her off of IV fluids  because keeping her hydrated can prolong things. 

It was easier to watch my mother as there was a lot less pain, and at the time I was happy that the laws around what can be done while they were in palliative care had changed. 

I'm not sure if either would have made arrangements with MAID had it been available to them at the time, but i feel it lifts a large burden off of those that are dying that the option is there. I know i will use it if I become terminally ill one day.

560,2020-09-04 03:38:52+00:00,"I spoke to a father today who buried his son due to opioid addiction. 


I work in medical debt collection. I know, I'm scum. I try to help people be sure insurance paid and financial aid is utilized. its what I can do, and I need this job. Moving on. 


I received a call from a father about his sons account. I informed him we would need the sons permission to speak with him Regarding it. He said that's why I'm calling in, my son passed away in April. Upon hearing that I looked to see the sons age. 20. Just two months until he would have been 21. He later said his son passed of an overdose. I notice the date of service was about two months before he passed. Out of curiosity I looked to see what the visit was for. ER visit. Nalaxone (can reverse opioid overdose.) Lorazepam to calm the patient. Injection of diphenhydramine (i think i spelled that right. Aka benadryl, likely for the itching caused by opiods.) Nicotine patch. Etc. 


I must admit I got emotional. I usually don't, as its usually rather impersonal, but I felt for the son and the father. I was addicted to opiates a few years ago. I got sober for a while but used again a few times. Not enough to restart the physical addiction, but when tolerance erodes and you relapse you are much more likely to die. Thank fuck I never shot up, needles terrify me, preferring mostly the nasal route of ingestion. 


That could have been me. Fuck, it almost was multiple times in the throes of addiction. I attempted suicide a few times by combining fantanyl or heroin and Xanax, an incredibly deadly combination, and I beg you never to do what ive done. There were nights I would nod off for minutes at a time, sometimes while playing video games and waking up running into a wall while my gamer friends asked if I was alright. Being able to utter only two or three words before nodding again. It was a living hell, and it was also kind of fun at times, which disguised the true nature of my behavior. 


Drugs ruined my life. I ruined my life with my addiction, selfishness, idiocy, and depression. I went to college with 4/5 of tuition payed for by a scholarship. I graduated in the top ten in my high-school. During my freshman year of college I started experimenting more. Having sold weed since I was 15, along with acid and other hallucinogens at times, I figured pills was the natural progression. Weed wasn't dangerous like we were told. Neither was acid. Molly wasn't so bad. Vyvanse and Concerta weren't bad. I'd tried opiates a couple times already with friends and abusing the remainder of a script after a surgery on a torn ACL when I was 16. Of course the remainder of the script lasted over a year, using them sparingly and always sharing. 


When sophomore year rolled around and I moved out of my friends place into an apartment with one of my best friends, our other friend got out of juvie/jail for a drive by shooting. He was a good kid, honestly a nice person and beautiful and fun. He had been using the hard drugs when the incident happened and spent a couple years locked up and was getting his life back on track attending school. He lived in a medical Marijuana state and would sometimes bring us some weight. A few times bringing a couple pounds and preparing it and selling it while staying with us and other family for a week. He had also gotten back into opiates. Percocet mostly. Its just a small pill, with such a big punch. A lot of opiate addicts prefer percocet over heroin and fentanyl as it feels better in my opinion, and is much easier to dose accurately providing you've got real pharma pills and not pressed pills. 


My local weed guys had also starting bringing percs around, and sometimes hydrocodone aka vicodin, Lortab, and Norcos. Occasionally friends would have morphine and that was relatively easy to get as well when percs weren't around. I started buying scripts and selling some and using the rest. We all had certain connects and sold to each other regularly. Sometimes you'd find some opana and dilauded and they were on a different level. 


After 3 or so years of this I ended up moving in with the buddy who oringally introduced me to them my sophomore year when I started really abusing them. After a month or two of living together, he told me our old grower buddy brought over some heroin one day and he tried it. It was good, nobody died. A couple days later and he came again, and I tried some as well, something I swore to myself I would never do. Never hard drugs. Never the street drugs. Only weed and some hallucinogens and the occasional, now daily, pills. 

Heroin was much cheaper than pills, but it was in short supply. Eventually we connected with people selling fentanyl, cheaper still, stronger, but shorter lasting. And so the story goes. We used every day that we had some, or could get some, buying it, trading weed we had grown for it, etc. Luckily I was pretty broke at the time with a shifty job, so I couldn't use it as much as I'd like sometimes having a day or two off from having my own bag. Maybe I'd be given a line or two by someone, and sometimes we would find pills, but I consider myself lucky. My withdrawal wasn't even that bad when I stopped, despite using opiates nearly daily for a few years, sans a roughly 4 to 6 month period I had gotten sober from it all after a friend had died in an unrelated way. And I couldn't afford it. As soon as my next student loan payment came in next semester though, I was back. 


Point is, I am lucky to have had an incredible friend in my ex girlfriend who I was broken up with at the time, but still friends then and to this day. I credit her with saving my life, as on one of my nights of near death I told her I wanted to die and what I was doing, and she promptly told my mother. Two weeks later I was sober and living with my mom again. 

I'm 25 now, been sober from it for a few years except for the brief relapse a couple years ago. I have no degree. I have roughly 50k in student loan debt despite the scholarship that I ended up losing. It destroyed my sense of self worth, my self esteem, my belief in a positive future for myself, my relationships with so many people, my sex drive, the list goes on and on. Opiods are the closest thing to hell that the average person has a chance of experiencing in my opinion, and I'm still trying to recover to this day and be the person I was before I did all of that. 


Luckily my family loves me and supported me. I never stole, never cheated people, and was still trying to be a contributing member of society throughout the addiction. I'm so lucky to be out of it and I just want people to realize how hellish it is, and how slippery of a slope it is. It's like playing on a frozen lake. You may step out onto the ice and be fine. Another step and you're okay. Soon you're in the middle of the frozen lake feeling invincible. Yet the ice has been melting this whole time, the stability slowly eroding. Until finally, quickly, in an instant, the ice cracks and you drown underneath the chilling water, unable to breath or resurface due to the weight and immensity of the ice above. And then it's over. 

Please don't ever start, and its never too late to inch away from the center of the lake to more solid ground. Sorry for the short novel, I just wanted to share my life story and hope some people can be helped. This issue is dear to my heart, and I still have friends suffering through it, although I can't maintain relationships with them as I am too weak to not fall back in. Be safe. Practice harm reduction and try to keep nalaxone around if you're going to use. And please don't give up hope.

A white guy was killed the same exact way a week before, google Duncan Kemp. The issue is the fucked up law that lets police conduct no knock warrants. It‚Äôs important to distinguish and provide nuance or else we end up with the a false narrative that drives further violence.",0

Aside from a knee for too long, the cops were entirely polite and understanding, even offering to help him repeatedly. If he hadn't died, that would have been pretty text book for police or MMA (where it and similar are standard positions where normal healthy people don't die).

So which way was he killed? Was it them offering to lower the windows and get him water the excessive force? The repeated polite requests he get out of his car, or all of the times he refused to get into theirs? Those big, scary, nice police men! How dare they!

I'm not being either of those things. I'm using these other examples to make a point. I don't think the death penalty should be used at all, or at least in very tightly controlled situations. I also think that jumping to super-harsh laws for prohibition is a lazy approach that often causes unnecessary suffering. Other options should be explored besides sacrificing people for examples and deterrence. Portugal is the most famous example, where everyone using conventional wisdom would assume that heroin and other hard drug use would skyrocket. This did not occur ([1](https://time.com/longform/portugal-drug-use-decriminalization/), [2](https://transformdrugs.org/drug-decriminalisation-in-portugal-setting-the-record-straight/)). There are plenty of successful countries out there that aren't falling into chaos due to their lack of killing drug users and traffickers - demonstrating that the death penalty isn't the only way of preventing civilization collapse or whatever you think would happen.
&gt;I do believe that people who drive drunk should be executed. No excuses. But for bad driving in general, there should be harsher penalties for it, but not execution. 

What is your metric for when you should go death penalty? Is it some percentage of deaths directly attributable, or some other factor? What about people who text and drive, which is responsible for a large number of [deaths](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving)? As texting and driving deaths increase, should we just jump straight to death penalty or maybe try out some other methods before we start executing distracted soccer moms? 

I'm not advocating for people to start using drugs, or that we should just sit by and accept free use of the hard drugs you mentioned. I am only saying that death penalty is barbaric and too extreme for that versus exploring other approaches.

&gt;While they‚Äôre not really nutritious, you can still easily moderate your intake of high sugary foods. There is no ‚Äúmoderating‚Äù crack/heroin/meth and other usage. There are no benefits to using those if they‚Äôre not controlled and administered in a medical setting.

There are plenty of widely successful people in this world who have used hard drugs a few times and put them away to move on with their lives productively. Others have recovered from extensive use ([1](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2016/12/1/13779148/meth-drug-addiction-help), [2](https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/01/30/story2.html), [3](https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/01/30/story2.html). 

But lets get away from your specific examples of meth, crack, heroi. Singapore has death penalties for shit like [Weed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_Drugs_Act_(Singapore)). Are you going to argue that places where it is legal are cesspools that only the death penalty would fix? California's GDP would beg to differ.",1

It‚Äôs the same ignorance that say, ‚Äúwell have you tried using a planner?‚Äù this post is a tad tone deaf and just because you have adolescent friends who can‚Äôt use addy to get through a night of studying without creating a habit or addiction is more of a personal issue than a systemic ‚Äúdrugs are bad mkayyy‚Äù one. dependency is real, but i‚Äôve personally never had a friend addicted so bad to adderall they were selling their belongings to get high. Oxycodine on the other hand... 

docs are imperfect, was there an overprescribing of adhd medication in the 90s due to pharmaceutical lobbying? ohh most definitely. same with oxy. Drugs are chemically agnostic. There are no inherently ‚Äúbad or good‚Äù drugs. There are bad and good behaviors. think in a progressive manner  instead of demonizing people who are humans and struggle with their own vices or addictive behaviors.

626,2020-09-01 02:37:12+00:00,"I call it bad timing. Autopsy said fentynyl. How come floyd said he couldnt breathe while he was still standing up? Because drugs. Those cops are gonna walk because idiots like you see a facebook post, then demand murder charges, when at worst its just negligence.",1
627,2020-09-01 01:04:46+00:00,"Exactly. Bodycam footage &amp; eywitness reports show that he fought with the police and started saying ""he couldn't breathe"" well before there was anything close to physical altercations. What can cause shortness of breath? Opioids, like fetanyl.

Autopsy reports show he died from respiratory arrest from the MASSIVE amounts of fetanyl active in his bloodstream at the time. There is \*no\* evidence of asphyxiation.

Medical stuff aside, not one piece of evidence shows that race had anything to do with the killing.

Similar case with Jacob Blake. He was at the ex-girlfriend's house, sexually assaulted her with his fingers, held a knife up to her, then outside he wrestled with cops, was tazed (which had no effect on bringing him down), then reached into his car for a weapon.

No evidence that race played a factor there either. It seems most of these instances point to being violent and combative with the police, not skin color.",2

Here is an article from Scientific American written by a dozen Medical Doctors explaining how you have been duped into thinking something that just isn't true.

https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/george-floyds-autopsy-and-the-structural-gaslighting-of-america/ 

Dude, I was an Army nurse for 6 years and I have given a ton of fentanyl to post surgical patients and combat casualties. Nothing about George Floyd's behavior during the event in question is indicative of fentanyl overdose to me. While 11 ng/ml is admittedly quite a bit, unless you know his history of fenanyl use, you cant have any idea if it would be a lethal dose. Habitual opioid use builds tolerance.  So, you dont know what you are talking about. Additionally, a quick google search will produce multiple pieces written my medical professions emphasizing that George Floyd did not die of drug overdose. 

The truth is, you have shown a repeated interest in presenting you misunderstandings as ""facts"" and failing to provide evidence. The fact that you pretend to be a liberal and come hear to troll people is further indication of your lack of credibility. Honestly, its kind of pathetic. 

Once again, if you want to have a real discussion about things, lets do it. But if you are just going to spew your senseless snake oil, I am not interested.",1

632,2020-08-31 22:07:44+00:00,if you have heroin cut with fentanyl to make it stronger its not called fentanyl powder... its called heroin. and thats completely different then ingesting like 2mg of pure fentayl powder. you can easily swallow a small bag of heroin and be fine if you have a tolerance. nothign about their story makes sense from a drug perspective. trust me i literally was an opiate addict. I know how it works,1

Both of us work in dt stp, but its bad, unsafe and full of trash (literal trash like plastic cups, broken glass and cigarette butts.) And the four police in my legal opinion will likely be acquitted.  Murder one was an over charge.  Keith Ellison made it political.  The facts support an acquittal.  Especially if a leathly dose of fentanayl was in his system at death.  And when the acquittal comes, id anticipate a riot bigger then we saw in May/June.",2
634,2020-08-31 20:04:19+00:00,"O que eu estou tentando te explicar √© que a estat√≠stica aponta que o v√≠cio psicol√≥gico √© respons√°vel por mais de 80% dos viciados. A depend√™ncia qu√≠mica representa o restante. Por isso exemplifiquei com os estudos feitos com fumantes que tentaram usar adesivos de nicotina para n√£o danar seus pulm√µes. A maior parte dos fumantes preferiu continuar fumando. Por qu√™? Porque a depend√™ncia qu√≠mica n√£o √© o principal fator determinante. O v√≠cio psicol√≥gico que faz o viciado. Por isso que uma pessoa com um c√©rebro normal e experi√™ncias de vida normais tem muito pouca chance de se viciar. E sem o v√≠cio, a depend√™ncia qu√≠mica n√£o leva em nada. Por isso que muita gente experimenta drogas, sem nunca formar o h√°bito de injetar, cheirar ou fumar toda semana. Basta fazer uma enquete na tua cidade. Compare os n√∫meros. Menos de 5% dos que usam viciam-se.


Quanto a classifica√ß√£o das drogas, mais uma vez, √© propaganda do Estado. Afinal, hoje temos muitos estudos sobre o uso da maconha. Ainda assim, nos EUA, onde as drogas s√£o classificadas de 1-5 conforme possibilidade de uso medicinal e de v√≠cio, a maconha √© tida como Schedule 1, sendo 1 uma droga sem uso medicinal e potencial alto de abuso e v√≠cio. √â essa a maconha que voc√™ conhece? LSD, peyote, ecstasy e hero√≠na tamb√©m se encontrar nessa mesma categoria... Coca√≠na, metadona e oxycotin (n√£o sei tradu√ß√£o) s√£o Schedule 2 (teoricamente mais leves). No Schedule 3 incluem-se medicamentos com at√© 90mg de *code√≠na* e a parada √© famosa por ser altamente viciante, colaborou muito na crise dos opioides nos EUA. Convido voc√™ a procurar a listagem americana e os dados que quiser. √â ""ci√™ncia"" mascarando a pol√≠tica. A guerra as drogas sempre foi assim. Por isso o foco na depend√™ncia, e n√£o no v√≠cio. O estere√≥tipo do viciado disfuncional, ao inv√©s da realidade da criminaliza√ß√£o.


Sei que voc√™ n√£o est√° defendendo a criminaliza√ß√£o. Mas est√° defendendo os estere√≥tipos atrelados √† mesma.",1
635,2020-08-31 20:01:28+00:00,"Wow, thank you for your perspective. I haven't been addicted, so my perspective is after decades of talking to addicts and former addicts. You probably have more experience than me, but from what I've heard your experience is the exception more than the rule. I've known folks who haven't drank in 20 years but still call themselves an alcoholic because they know that they still react to it the same way, and they still have to actively fight the urge to drink when stressed. I've known heroin addicts who quit because of legal trouble and rehab, and even after years clean, they still get a nostalgic gleam in their eye when talking about how great it felt to shoot up. 

As for the relapse...I've known folks who have quit only once, and I've known folks who have quit dozens of times. Everyone is different, and I'm sorry if I offended you by pigeonholing. Congratulations on getting clean and I'm glad that you are able to enjoy life now. I had 2 cousins OD on Fentonyl last month so I know not everyone gets that chance.",1
