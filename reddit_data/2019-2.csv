6,2019-02-28 15:00:03+00:00,"It‚Äôs a natural opiate, the (usually powdered) leaves of the mitraganya specioca plant (spelling very wrong..) native to Asia. What makes it different is that it has a built in anti-abuse system. 

If you take a little, you feel mildly stimulated, maybe like tea with anti anxiety effects. Take decent dose and you will most likely experience a mild to moderate opiate buzz but, it‚Äôs when you get into the higher doses that I think make this plant amazing for recovering addicts.

When you try to get ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù on kratom (try to get higher then that mild buzz which I would comparable to a low dose percocet) you regret it very quickly.

You start to get a blurr in your eyes, hard to focus. Then comes a rising wave of nausea which will ruin your nice buzz untill you force vomit or just do it naturally once it overwhelms you, then you get to deal with a savage head ache for usually at least an hour. 

This is clearly an overdose, not a life threatening one but most defiantly so. Pot can be just like this, if you see an inexperienced smoker take one toke too many, it can be a harrowing experience but I‚Äôm sure we can all see by now, not life threatening for the vast majority of people.

‚ÄúWhy the fuck does this make kratom awesome?‚Äù You may be mumbling right now. Well, when people overdose on heroin and most opiates, they die. Very quickly and generally experience nothing. If there‚Äôs an afterlife, these people would be BEWILDERED standing at the pearly gates because, from their point of view, it feels like any other ‚Äúnod‚Äù which most opiate users strive to reach. 

This nod is right on the verge of a LETHAL overdose as the doses are not far apart for the classic opiate/opioid substances. Roughly 4x the recreational dose is lethal. 

This means two things. 1) When someone overdoses, they either die or pass out blissfully (comatose, gasping, as their weak lungs struggle to breath) and wake up eventually with no negative effects (apparent to them) 2) Someone try‚Äôs to help them with a hit of naloxone (narcan) and they are hurled out of bliss into immediate HARD CORE withdrawal symptoms.

For option one, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúmoment of clarity‚Äù as there is no negative part to the experience. You either survive without realizing how close you came to death or just check out and that‚Äôs all folks, another statistic on CNN.
- so most people keep going and pushing their luck


Number two.. Narcan, ohhhh narcan!
What a godsend, I can‚Äôt even imagine how many lives have quite literally been saved with narcan. It works by blocking the pathway that specificly opiate chemicals use to transfer their effect so that any that are currently ‚Äúplugged in‚Äù to your brain, are taken out of the socket and the socket then plugged with one of those child safe plastic stoppers to prevent the pathway from being used for however the narcan lasts. This also makes it useful for maintaining abstinence from opiates because while you are taking the narcan, the opiates can‚Äôt ‚Äúplug in‚Äù to the pathway, making most drugs in this class USELESS or counterproductive (instant withdrawal without any high)

Quite often an addict who nearly died resents being woken and would rather have risked death (or even accepted it) rather then be flung into a nightmare that they spend every waking moment of the day trying desperately to avoid, usually at all costs. 

After this experience people usually go one of two ways, they get some much needed help and truly try to get off the smack, or they make sure that next time, they won‚Äôt wake up in a ambulance, the would rather NOT WAKE UP AT ALL.

Now with me, I‚Äôve been through the cycle half a dozen times before. No matter how much I wanted to get away from heroin, i didn‚Äôt want to get away from that feeling, I might not have wanted to get high out of my mind anymore, but the reason I started using downers was still their (anxiety, multiple skeletal injuries, ‚Äúadhd‚Äù), opiates helped me with all of these but I was gonna die if I kept using street drugs laced with dirt and now FENTANYL. 

So after my last initial detox (2-3 years ago now), I decided I would start a using kratom AND ONLY KRATOM instead. So I did, when i would get urges, I would swig some green sludge and 10 minutes later that familiar feeling started flowing through my limbs eventually calming me.

Sometimes life wouldn‚Äôt go so well for me and I‚Äôd have the urge to get ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù again (maddening urge), in keeping with my plan to stay off street drugs I tried with kratom, over and over and each time I would get the same result ‚Äúnice job asshole, you had a nice buzz going but you HAD to overdo it... now your heads ringing ear to ear and anything you ate today just went down the toilet‚Äù 

It didn‚Äôt take many try‚Äôs to associate trying to get fucked up with a really shitty time. Eventually as more and more time passed, I thought more about why I got these urges, what else i could do instead of my go to, all this time using the kratom to keep me ‚Äúleveled‚Äù when I was on the brink. Eventually I did, of course, become physically dependent on kratom but it‚Äôs kept me from getting into any nasty shit for the longest time in my life, a trade off I was well prepared for and aware of. 

Kratom gave me time to think, time to learn myself and understand a my compulsions. Today I still take it daily but I finally think I am truly ready to handle life without it as my crutch now and have been lowering my doses down drastically without much discomfort (defiantly nothing compared to methadone or suboxone withdrawal, which where my only other options for long term opiate maintenance.

I have tried cold turkey coming off kratom just to compare it to Fentenyl/dope/OxyContin (my previous detox experiences) and for me at least, it is much more mild in all aspects but given the option, dropping dose down over the course of 2-4 weeks is turning out to be nearly painless (mild waves of discomfort throughout the day, nothing I would have to miss work over.

This worked for me, it might not work for others but, I know that with the state of things in my town and my tendencies, I would not have made it another year through as quite a few people I‚Äôve known from that life, sadly, did not..

Kratom also helps with most opiate withdrawal symptoms, for anyone trying to detox somewhat comfortably.

All in all, it‚Äôs been a fucking bitch getting through all this, trial and error, detox and relapse, health problems... it would be nice if someone else benefits from it as well.

To _Anyone_ else who is going through this,
If you need more info and don‚Äôt want to post to the topic, feel free to message me directly, I understand that not everyone wants to or can be open about it, personally it helps me to talk to others who know what it‚Äôs like to be in that hell hole of dependence and despair as it‚Äôs almost impossible to explain in words to someone unfamiliar with the state.

Live long and prosper üññüèΩ

There is difference between doing drugs with your friends or alone and recording with drugs recreationally vs abusing drugs. If you have ever been in the studio you would know.  I know your point is going to be ‚Äúwell he drank beers with his friends the night he died, then went and did drugs and drank and abused them while he recorded music and died and it‚Äôs because he was abusing. Thing is, that‚Äôs not drug addict activity. That is Mac continuing to drink, continuing to do the blow he was enjoying because the song he was making was dope and that blow helped make it dope and continued partying with his friends. What is sad is he continued to party by himself and prob do blow by himself. And I personally think he realized that he wasn‚Äôt going to bed because he was so hyped and the blow was soo good and he realized I gotta be up in the morning to do an interview and shot video later so therefore I need to go to bed. He realized then he had a little downer (fentanayl) and he could risk taking a little bump of that in order to go to bed.  Personally I think once he hit the Fent or whatever pill he was told the fent was; I think he realized then he he made a mistake which increased his heart rate from the blow. I think the increased heart rate from blow, the heavy drinking with friends watching the football game and the additional drinking when he was by himself recording music plus the downer he took was just too much. I honestly believe it was complete accident. He was drinking, then they prob passed some blow, that got him in mood to do more blow and make music, if you do more blow you are going to want to drink more, and then you realize it‚Äôs too late at the end of the night and wish u can sleep. Well he‚Äôs a star and he either has a pill or bag of Fent which he assumes will help sleep. Take that then u feel your heart stop. I personally think that is exactly what happened. Have said that since it happened. I‚Äôll never be over Mac being gone. I think abt Mac at least once a day and I cried when Mac died but not when my grandfather did who I was close with. I honestly believe this is one of the biggest travesties that could have been avoided in our life. Mac will end up going down as someone who impacted music more than most artists. He was not the #1 commercially successful artist but I would bet all I have and say he will go down as one of the most I influential. He made all his own beats and wrote all his own music and wrote all his own lyrics. Who else does that right now

12,2019-02-28 01:01:54+00:00," C√É¬¥nsul geral da Fran√É¬ßa em S√É¬£o Paulo, Brieuc Pont recorre a um pensamento do estilista alem√É¬£o [Karl ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/lagerfeld-era-super-heroi-da-moda-que-tornou-imortal-tudo-o-que-tocou.shtml)[Lagerfeld](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/lagerfeld-era-super-heroi-da-moda-que-tornou-imortal-tudo-o-que-tocou.shtml) (1933-2019) para defender a import√É¬¢ncia do ensino de franc√É¬™s em um mundo no qual o ingl√É¬™s virou pr√É¬©-requisito. √¢¬Ä¬úEle dizia: hoje em dia, falar s√É¬≥ duas l√É¬≠nguas √É¬© brega√¢¬Ä¬ù, afirma.

 Filho de diplomata e ex-aluno do Lyc√É¬©e Pasteur, em S√É¬£o Paulo, [Pont, 45](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/patriciacamposmello/2018/12/consul-frances-e-vitima-dos-visigodos-digitais-brasileiros.shtml), √É¬© um entusiasta de um projeto milion√É¬°rio que ser√É¬° inaugurado nesta semana e pode movimentar o [mercado de escolas bil√É¬≠ngues](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2019/02/com-mensalidade-a-partir-de-r-1000-ensino-bilingue-chega-ate-a-periferia-de-sp.shtml) na capital paulista.

 Trata-se da fus√É¬£o do Lyc√É¬©e, de curr√É¬≠culo bil√É¬≠ngue, com o [Liceu Pasteur](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/sobretudo/morar/2017/03/1865558-zona-sul-concentra-as-melhores-escolas-da-capital-paulista.shtml), com aulas predominantemente em portugu√É¬™s, ambos na Vila Mariana (zona sul de S√É¬£o Paulo).

 A unifica√É¬ß√É¬£o, com investimento de R$ 150 milh√É¬µes, incluiu a reforma do pr√É¬©dio da unidade da rua Mairinque, projetada por [Ramos de Azevedo (1851-1928)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/imoveis/ci250101.htm). Ela ir√É¬° sediar a nova institui√É¬ß√É¬£o, que passar√É¬° a ser chamada de Grand Lyc√É¬©e Pasteur.

 O curr√É¬≠culo ser√É¬° o pluril√É¬≠ngue, j√É¬° adotado atualmente no Lyc√É¬©e. Todas as aulas ser√É¬£o em franc√É¬™s, com exce√É¬ß√É¬£o de educa√É¬ß√É¬£o f√É¬≠sica, m√É¬∫sica, l√É¬≠ngua portuguesa e hist√É¬≥ria e geografia do Brasil.

 Haver√É¬° ainda cursos obrigat√É¬≥rios de ingl√É¬™s e optativos de alem√É¬£o, espanhol, grego e latim.

 Prevista para terminar em 2023, a fus√É¬£o de curr√É¬≠culos come√É¬ßou em 2018, com a educa√É¬ß√É¬£o infantil, e ser√É¬° gradual para os j√É¬° matriculados no ensino fundamental no curso brasileiro.

 A mensalidade, na faixa de R$ 3.000 para per√É¬≠odo integral, ficar√É¬° abaixo da m√É¬©dia de outros col√É¬©gios de elite em S√É¬£o Paulo, em parte porque o governo franc√É¬™s d√É¬° um subs√É¬≠dio de cerca de √¢¬Ç¬¨ 3.000 ao ano por aluno (em torno de R$ 13 mil).

 Pont diz esperar que o valor seja um diferencial. √¢¬Ä¬úQueremos ser a melhor escola internacional com pre√É¬ßo acess√É¬≠vel√¢¬Ä¬ù, afirma. Sem citar a [Avenues](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2017/08/1910575-escola-com-mensalidade-de-r-8000-ja-tem-2000-pais-interessados-em-sp.shtml), com unidade em S√É¬£o Paulo inaugurada no ano passado, ele faz refer√É¬™ncia velada √É escola americana que se prop√É¬µe a formar √¢¬Ä¬úl√É¬≠deres globais√¢¬Ä¬ù e menciona a rede de liceus franceses pelo mundo.

 ""Vejo escola dizendo que cobra mensalidade de R$ 10 mil, mas que o aluno ter√É¬° acesso a mais de cinco unidades pelo mundo√¢¬Ä¬ù, afirma. √¢¬Ä¬úNosso sistema tem 496 escolas em 137 pa√É¬≠ses.√¢¬Ä¬ù

 Al√É¬©m do crescimento do mercado de escolas internacionais, outra motiva√É¬ß√É¬£o para a fus√É¬£o foi a constata√É¬ß√É¬£o de que outros col√É¬©gios tradicionais da capital paulista, como o [Bandeirantes](https://abecedario.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2016/10/31/escola-tradicional-de-sp-bandeirantes-elimina-divisao-de-turmas-por-area-e-por-notas/) e o [S√É¬£o Lu√É¬≠s](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/03/colegio-sao-luis-se-muda-da-paulista-para-ibirapuera-em-2020.shtml), estavam em transforma√É¬ß√É¬£o, diz o diretor geral do Liceu, Cl√É¬°udio Kassab.

 Eles esperam que, com as mudan√É¬ßas, o n√É¬∫mero de alunos aumente dos atuais 1.600 estudantes para 2.500.

 O objetivo √É¬© atrair um p√É¬∫blico que v√É¬° al√É¬©m da comunidade francesa em S√É¬£o Paulo.

 Para isso, Pont j√É¬° tem uma lista de argumentos √É m√É¬£o: em 2050, segundo proje√É¬ß√É¬µes, o franc√É¬™s ser√É¬° a terceira l√É¬≠ngua mais falada do mundo, e empresas do pa√É¬≠s est√É¬£o entre os grandes empregadores estrangeiros no Brasil.

 √¢¬Ä¬úFalar ingl√É¬™s √É¬© o m√É¬≠nimo que se exige hoje. Para ter um diferencial e dominar um terceiro idioma falado por milh√É¬µes de pessoas, qual escolher? Chin√É¬™s, √É¬°rabe? N√É¬≥s propomos o franc√É¬™s√¢¬Ä¬ù, diz.

 Para convencer as fam√É¬≠lias disso, haver√É¬° outro incentivo: o ensino de franc√É¬™s para os pais que assim quiserem e desconto na Alian√É¬ßa Francesa.

 A escola afirma que o conte√É¬∫do em portugu√É¬™s n√É¬£o ser√É¬° negligenciado, e que o aluno ser√É¬° preparado tanto para vestibulares do exterior como para o de universidades brasileiras.

 Al√É¬©m do idioma, o curr√É¬≠culo ter√É¬° ainda outras mat√É¬©rias com uma pitada francesa.

 Em conson√É¬¢ncia com o sistema educacional de seu pa√É¬≠s, filosofia e hist√É¬≥ria s√É¬£o consideradas mat√É¬©rias priorit√É¬°rias, segundo Pont, para que o aluno compreenda o mundo.

 √¢¬Ä¬úA [Caverna de Plat√É¬£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1996/8/18/mais!/18.html), por exemplo, nos faz pensar na internet√¢¬Ä¬ù, afirma, em refer√É¬™ncia √É met√É¬°fora criada pelo fil√É¬≥sofo grego, de homens acorrentados em uma gruta que pensam que a realidade s√É¬£o as sombras que veem projetadas.

 Nesse contexto, a tecnologia tem um papel delimitado na escola. Embora esteja presente nos laborat√É¬≥rios, sistemas de proje√É¬ß√É¬£o e laptops em diversas salas de aula, n√É¬£o √É¬© protagonista absoluta. √¢¬Ä¬úComo dizia [o fil√É¬≥sofo Jean-Jacques] Rosseau, ci√É¬™ncia sem consci√É¬™ncia √É¬© a ru√É¬≠na da alma√¢¬Ä¬ù, diz Pont. √¢¬Ä¬úTecnologia √É¬© muito importante, desde que o aluno tenha consci√É¬™ncia do que est√É¬° fazendo.√¢¬Ä¬ù

 A proposta se reflete na reforma do espa√É¬ßo. O objetivo, segundo a arquiteta Maria Coccoli, foi modernizar o pr√É¬©dio antigo, que havia sido descaracterizado, mas manter as marcas do tempo.

 Para recuperar o projeto original, a equipe fez uma pesquisa nos arquivos da prefeitura. Entre outras descobertas, encontraram v√É¬£os que haviam sido fechados para virar salas de dep√É¬≥sitos.

 Mantiveram algumas caracter√É¬≠sticas, como o piso de peroba e o arm√É¬°rio e a chapeleira da sala dos professores, e recuperaram ou adaptaram outras. A pintura das colunas da biblioteca foi retirada para deixar √É mostra os tijolos originais. Prateleiras antigas da biblioteca foram sustentar o palco no p√É¬°tio dos alunos.

 Para manter o forro de estuque das salas de aula sem que o barulho dos alunos tomasse conta do ambiente, foram encomendadas placas ac√É¬∫sticas da Su√É¬©cia.

 Com o investimento, a escola e o governo franc√É¬™s pretendem resgatar o prest√É¬≠gio da institui√É¬ß√É¬£o, que tem entre seus ex-alunos nomes como a cantora [Rita ](https://hashtag.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/09/19/tuites-de-rita-lee-sobre-bolsonaro-viralizam-sete-anos-depois/)[Lee](https://hashtag.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/09/19/tuites-de-rita-lee-sobre-bolsonaro-viralizam-sete-anos-depois/) e o maestro Jo√É¬£o Carlos Martins.

 √¢¬Ä¬úPrecisamos reconquistar esse p√É¬∫blico e mostrar que o franc√É¬™s √É¬© uma l√É¬≠ngua moderna dos neg√É¬≥cios e da intelectualidade√¢¬Ä¬ù, afirma o c√É¬¥nsul, para em seguida voltar a citar o estilista alem√É¬£o. √¢¬Ä¬úLagerfeld sabia tudo√¢¬Ä¬ù, brinca.

I believe many scientific organizations globally, some of whom are not in the pockets of Big Pharma, in the safety of vaccines.  The Oxycotin fiasco came about from the drug company overstating a footnote in a trial they sponsored, and were later to found had fudge the numbers to make Oxycotin look safer than it was.  Studies from other scientific and medical organizations later realized what happened.

Oh, and as far as stakeholder concerns go about profits... Did you know governments have to bribe Big Pharma (in the form of grants) to make vaccines?  Weirdly enough vaccines do not make that much money compared to one brand of stetin, nevermind narcotics like opium.",1

I have chronic depression and anxiety because of a chemical imbalance. Xanax fucked me up and made me a zombie, I was exhausted nonstop and less functional overall on it even days after my last dose.

I have autoimmune diabetes and high and low bloodsugars are part of my daily life. When I feel like I'm poisoned from a stress high or severely sick from having very low bloodsugar, I basically suffer for hours until I can get things leveled out again.

Weed replaced a lot of medication that made me unable to function and fucked with my body in irrepairable and expensive ways. Weed helps me with my disabilities by removing symptoms or making them irrelevant. My bloodsugar is very well controlled because my anxiety doesn't send my bloodsugar on insane rollercoasters. Weed doesn't render me functionless like Xanax did. I can **actually do stuff** again when I smoke.

I've never been more on top of chores than when I smoke. I have an easier time pushing my boundaries and bettering myself because I smoke. I've lost weight since I started smoking because I don't stress binge as much as I used to despite the occasional munchies. I lost weight because my pain stopped inhibiting me from doing simple things and the weed makes the pain manageable and less invasive.

Weed is not the devil. It's not an irresponsible habit. I was suffering so much from ""safe"" prescribed medicine that 7 years later I'm still paying for the side-effects that weed never gives me.

Fuck you for saying I'm wrong for relying on weed to medicate myself when conventional medicine fucked me over so much worse and more permanently than weed is ever capable of.",1

While Mexicans make up about 52% of the illegal immigrants in the US, the number of illegal border crossings has [plummeted over the last two decades](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Selected_Unauthorized_Immigration_Statistics.png/400px-Selected_Unauthorized_Immigration_Statistics.png). Since 2007, visa overstays have accounted for a much larger share of the growth in the undocumented immigrant population than illegal border crossings. 

As for the drug epidemic, it seems the vast majority of all drugs smuggled into the country come through designated ports of entry. For example, 85% of all smuggled fentinyl came into the U.S. this way.

Orcha - orca

Ursi Albi - white bears

In northern Sweden you have Arngrim, king of the Helsings (rex helsingorum) fighting Thengil, king of the S√°mi (Tengilus, rex scricfinorum - 'skiing finns'); this is from Norse mythology via Saxo Grammaticus.

Another legendary figure near the top there is ""Starkad, Swedish fighter"" (Starcaterus pugil sueticus), with the Latin also transliterated to the rather idiosyncratic runes of Olaus Magnus on the staffs he's holding. 

Anyway, the creator of the map, Olaus Magnus, wrote a big book - _A Description of the Northern Peoples_  (Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus) and most of what's on his map is explained in greater detail there, such as the various kinds of sea monsters.

55,2019-02-25 16:17:56+00:00,"Hydroxyzine is the only antihistamine that I actually enjoy. It's so soothing, whereas dph just  feels so DIRTY. Diazepam (Vallium) is a benzo, and I haven't any experience with those. The closest I've had is alcohol or maybe phenibut (but that's mostly gaba-b, not gaba-a). I've heard people with HUGE success switching to kratom.


It has agonist and antagonist alkaloids which creates a ceiling of effects, where you'll only get the most sick feeling ever and puke, as opposed to dying from respiratory depression or choking on vomit. But for real, when you take twice the dose you can handle of kratom it feels like nicotine OD viciously raped alcohol OD and had a disgusting child that you now have to birth repeatedly out of your stomach for 3 hours. Find your limit by taking a medium dose (3-4g for most adult males with no tolerance to opioidergic drugs), and up it with small increments to test where the effects are best for you.


This antagonist/agonist mix creates an effect ceiling that prevents you from getting too heavily dependent on it. However you should still pay attention to your dose.


By the way, Hydromorphone is also known as Exalgo. It's a Morphine derivative (hence the suffix morphone) as opposed to a codeine derivative (codone). Oxymorphone and hydromorphone are morphine derivatives, Oxycodone and Hydrocodone are codeine derivatives. I wanna try absinthe even though I'm not a *huge* fan of alcohol (though it can be great at times), just to know what it's like.

I know what you mean about the meditative mindset, opioid-like drugs kinda reduce your brain to a blend of homogenous bliss, where barriers and separations between parts of reality kinda mend together as a whole, beautiful painting, where you don't pay attention to each brush stroke and take the whole for what it is. Things seem so much simpler and at ease even just when you get endorphins going.


I see it like heroin is fine; but once you get your brain adjusted, it's no longer heroin, but an entirely different drug. If only drugs could be the same drug as when you started no matter how much you use it.


You sound like you have a good view of your relationship with heroin. I have no doubt you'll be able to recover with vigor if you put yourself to it. You recognize when the good heroin is gone, and when your situation can't be maintained long-term. You're serious about leaving it for the better. I salute you for that.

He was 5'10 and 220 pounds. Went to the gym everyday. His childhood crush who they have been playing Ross and Rachel for 10 years finally started dating and being 100% serious. He was working doing construction. Kneeled down to put some flooring in and got a nail right in his kneecap. Got a really bad staff infection( kept coming back too) he had surgery and was out of commission for a good month or two. In those two months his love of his life walked out on him, his older brother took his own life, and his grandfather he spent 1 day a week with since he was a baby died. Once the pain ended in his kneecap, the pain in his heart kept going. The oxy he was prescribed ran out and he wasn't ready for it to be gone. He tracked down a supplier and started using more and more. He was too ashamed to ever ask for help or receive it. He started to lose weight and I knew something was up.

 Este ano est√É¬° f√É¬°cil encontrar usu√É¬°rios do Twitter dizendo que resolveram n√É¬£o acompanhar a cerim√É¬¥nia pela TV para evitar a pol√É¬≠tica. E uma pesquisa com potenciais espectadores descobriu que 39% disseram que talvez n√É¬£o assistam √É entrega dos pr√É¬™mios, pelo mesmo motivo.

 √É¬Äs vezes √¢¬Ä¬úpol√É¬≠tico demais√¢¬Ä¬ù quer dizer discursos de aceita√É¬ß√É¬£o de vi√É¬©s partid√É¬°rio evidente. Mas, se o objetivo foi criticar a presen√É¬ßa de filmes politizados, os f√É¬£s aborrecidos t√É¬™m raz√É¬£o: os Oscar est√É¬£o especialmente pol√É¬≠ticos este ano.

 Analisei todos os 554 candidatos ao Oscar de melhor filme ao longo da hist√É¬≥ria da Academia. Conclu√É¬≠ que este ano h√É¬° mais participantes na disputa que enfatizam o lado pol√É¬≠tico que em qualquer dos 75 anos anteriores.

 √É¬â verdade que em muitos daqueles anos houve menos indicados a melhor filme, mas, mesmo em termos percentuais, 2018 ainda √É¬© um dos anos mais pol√É¬≠ticos na hist√É¬≥ria do Oscar.

 Para chegar a essa conclus√É¬£o matematicamente √É¬© preciso classificar todos os 554 filmes como pol√É¬≠ticos ou apol√É¬≠ticos, e isso n√É¬£o √É¬© tarefa f√É¬°cil. Quase todos os filmes poderiam ser interpretados como pol√É¬≠ticos em algum n√É¬≠vel: a pol√É¬≠tica afeta todo empreendimento humano, e podemos interpretar um filme como coment√É¬°rio sobre um sem-n√É¬∫mero de quest√É¬µes.

 Ent√É¬£o defini algumas regras b√É¬°sicas. Para ser considerado pol√É¬≠tico para os meus prop√É¬≥sitos, um filme teria que se enquadrar em pelo menos um de cinco crit√É¬©rios:

  2. Mostrar uma tentativa de conquistar poder pol√É¬≠tico, como em √¢¬Ä¬úCidad√É¬£o Kane√¢¬Ä¬ù (1941), em que o personagem principal concorre a governador de Nova York;
 4. Mostrar uma discuss√É¬£o sobre como governar, como √É¬© o caso de √¢¬Ä¬úMr. Smith Goes to Washington√¢¬Ä¬ù (1939), em que um homem isolado assume posi√É¬ß√É¬£o contra a corrup√É¬ß√É¬£o no Senado;
 6. Tratar de acontecimentos pol√É¬≠ticos passados ou presentes, como as entrevistas hist√É¬≥ricas mostradas em √¢¬Ä¬úFrost/Nixon√¢¬Ä¬ù (2008);
 8. Tratar de um conflito entre pot√É¬™ncias soberanas, como negocia√É¬ß√É¬µes durante a Guerra Fria em √¢¬Ä¬úPonte dos Espi√É¬µes√¢¬Ä¬ù (2015);
 10. Ou tomar posi√É¬ß√É¬£o muito clara sobre uma quest√É¬£o, como a mensagem antiguerra declarada de √¢¬Ä¬úSem Novidade no Front√¢¬Ä¬ù (1930).
  Evidentemente √É¬© imposs√É¬≠vel ser perfeitamente objetivo quando se classifica filmes desse modo, mas me esforcei para tratar os t√É¬≠tulos com coer√É¬™ncia.

 Com essas regras definidas, considero pol√É¬≠ticos seis dos indicados a melhor filme este ano.

 Com seis filmes de vi√É¬©s pol√É¬≠tico na disputa, este ano est√É¬° empatado com 1944 no segundo lugar em n√É¬∫mero, perdendo apenas para os sete filmes indicados em 1943.

 No auge da Segunda Guerra Mundial, √É¬© evidente que a pol√É¬≠tica dominava o pensamento tanto dos cineastas quanto do p√É¬∫blico. O vencedor de 1943 foi √¢¬Ä¬úMrs. Miniver√¢¬Ä¬ù, a hist√É¬≥ria de uma brit√É¬¢nica no front dom√É¬©stico. O filme se encerra com um discurso pr√É¬≥-Aliados t√É¬£o comovente e persuasivo que o presidente Roosevelt o mandou imprimir e jogar de avi√É¬µes sobre as √É¬°reas sob ocupa√É¬ß√É¬£o alem√É¬£.

 Em 1944 o Oscar de melhor filme ficou com √¢¬Ä¬úCasablanca√¢¬Ä¬ù, hist√É¬≥ria cl√É¬°ssica sobre intrigas pol√É¬≠ticas em tempos de guerra e um americano expatriado relutante em ser her√É¬≥i.

 Em termos percentuais, 75% dos indicados deste ano trazem temas pol√É¬≠ticos. Com isso, este ano ocupa o sexto lugar, depois de cinco outros anos em que 80% dos indicados a melhor filme tiveram teor pol√É¬≠tico. Para contextualizar essa cifra, vale lembrar que ao longo do conjunto de anos, apenas 38% dos filmes ao todo foram classificados como tendo teor pol√É¬≠tico.

 Mas esse n√É¬∫mero de 38% n√É¬£o se manteve est√É¬°vel no tempo. [Ao longo dos 90 anos de hist√É¬≥ria do Oscar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/oscar-de-2019-e-o-que-mais-valoriza-as-biografias.shtml) os dados indicam ano a ano uma alta modesta na porcentagem dos indicados a melhor filme que tratam de quest√É¬µes pol√É¬≠ticas. Nos 30 primeiros anos do Oscar, 34% dos filmes indicados na categoria foram pol√É¬≠ticos; nos 30 anos mais recentes, foram 41%.

 N√É¬£o apenas os indicados de 2018 compartilham um tema pol√É¬≠tico, como dois deles chegam a especificamente colocar o rosto do[ presidente Trump na tela](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/01/trump-e-john-travolta-disputam-framboesa-de-ouro-o-oscar-do-pior-do-ano.shtml). A imagem de √¢¬Ä¬úTrump√¢¬Ä¬ù aparece brevemente em √¢¬Ä¬úVice√¢¬Ä¬ù durante uma montagem dos anos 1980, se bem que a inten√É¬ß√É¬£o tenha claramente sido de transmitir uma mensagem mais ampla sobre os pontos em comum entre a pol√É¬≠tica de Dick Cheney e a de Donald Trump.

 Em √¢¬Ä¬úInfiltrado na Klan√¢¬Ä¬ù, o filme conclui com um flash-forward para o protesto nacionalista branco em Charlottesville. Durante essa sequ√É¬™ncia final, Trump faz sua declara√É¬ß√É¬£o infame sobre √¢¬Ä¬úos muitos lados√¢¬Ä¬ù, enquanto Spike Lee sugere que o mal que ele filmou na d√É¬©cada de 1970 continua presente hoje.

 Analisando os 554 indicados ao Oscar de melhor filme, identifiquei apenas um outro ano em que um presidente em exerc√É¬≠cio da fun√É¬ß√É¬£o √É¬© visto duas vezes na tela: 1976, quando Gerald Ford p√É¬¥de se ver na tela grande duas vezes. Na cena de abertura de √¢¬Ä¬úTodos os Homens do Presidente√¢¬Ä¬ù, sobre a investiga√É¬ß√É¬£o do caso Watergate pelo √¢¬Ä¬úWashington Post√¢¬Ä¬ù, Ford aplaude em p√É¬© enquanto Richard Nixon, ainda presidente, entra no Congresso para fazer o discurso do Estado da Uni√É¬£o. Em √¢¬Ä¬úNetwork √¢¬Ä¬ì Rede de Intrigas√¢¬Ä¬ù, uma hist√É¬≥ria cautelar √É frente de seu tempo sobre o poder corruptor da televis√É¬£o, Ford √É¬© visto brevemente na TV na sala de controle, at√É¬© a tela passar a mostrar o exc√É¬™ntrico apresentador Howard Beale.

 Quando chegou o momento da entrega dos Oscar, em mar√É¬ßo de 1977, Ford j√É¬° havia perdido a Presid√É¬™ncia para Jimmy Carter, e o cl√É¬°ssico sobre boxe √¢¬Ä¬úRocky √¢¬Ä¬ì Um Lutador√¢¬Ä¬ù derrotou os dois trabalhos, ficando com o Oscar de melhor filme.

 Vale notar que √¢¬Ä¬úRocky√¢¬Ä¬ù foi o √É¬∫nico indicado a melhor filme que p√É¬¥de ser considerado apol√É¬≠tico naquele ano. Al√É¬©m de √¢¬Ä¬úTodos os Homens do Presidente√¢¬Ä¬ù e √¢¬Ä¬úNetwork√¢¬Ä¬ù, os candidatos naquele ano inclu√É¬≠ram √¢¬Ä¬úTaxi Driver√¢¬Ä¬ù, cujo protagonista alienado cogita assassinar o presidente, al√É¬©m de Woody Guthrie tocando uma can√É¬ß√É¬£o pr√É¬≥-movimento sindical em √¢¬Ä¬úEsta √É¬© Minha Terra√¢¬Ä¬ù.

 Com isso, √¢¬Ä¬úRocky√¢¬Ä¬ù se torna um de apenas dois filmes apol√É¬≠ticos a terem vencido em um campo dominado por filmes pol√É¬≠ticos. O outro √É¬© √¢¬Ä¬úAmadeus√¢¬Ä¬ù, de 1984, a hist√É¬≥ria da rivalidade entre Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart e Antonio Salieri.

 Esses dois anos fogem um pouco da norma, porque, historicamente falando, os filmes pol√É¬≠ticos sempre contaram com uma pequena vantagem. Filmes apol√É¬≠ticos venceram em 15% das vezes que foram indicados, mas no caso de filmes pol√É¬≠ticos foram 19% das vezes.

 Isso pode ser um bom sinal para √¢¬Ä¬úInfiltrado na Klan√¢¬Ä¬ù, √¢¬Ä¬úGreen Book √¢¬Ä¬ì O Guia√¢¬Ä¬ù, √¢¬Ä¬úA Favorita√¢¬Ä¬ù, √¢¬Ä¬úRoma√¢¬Ä¬ù ou √¢¬Ä¬úVice√¢¬Ä¬ù. Porque os Oscar ainda s√É¬£o muito politizados e n√É¬£o d√É¬£o sinal de estarem abandonando a campanha.

68,2019-02-24 20:13:45+00:00,"Prescription fentantyl (and other opioids) are getting people hooked, then when the Rx runs out they go to the black market stuff that kills 'em. It also creates the supply. Finally, it's hard for me to believe that situations where someone is prescribed 60 pills per day are ones where that use is safe.

I'm 100% with you on regulation being better than the drug war. That said, I think we in the US are quick with the assumption of ""people are going to use drugs."" That's true to a small extent, but drug epidemics of the sort we've got are largely caused by people not knowing how to thrive in our society. 

If you look at wealthy European democracies, their incidence of drug use is way below ours. I think that's got a lot to do with the fact that there are fewer circumstances to put a person into desperate straits. In the US, one healthcare bill can bankrupt you while leaving you too poor to take the time to fully recover so you're left permanently hurting. The lack of safety net means workers must often push through 60-70 hour weeks at multiple jobs on the regular with many people turning to pick-me-ups much stronger than coffee to get through their routine. If people could survive without pushing themselves to the breaking point and felt like they had control of their lives (at least enough to say 'no' to things that hurt them), they would have less desire for drug use *and* more desire to do other things (after 70 hours worked, your only desire tends to be to not move for a bit and have the tiredness go away).

This is borne out in experiments with rats. When placed in a cage with access to heroin, rats will get addicted to the stuff, eventually preferring it to food or sex. However, if you do the same experiment but the rats are in an environment which is healthy and stimulating for them (room to play, etc.) - they don't end up using it.

The solution to most of our drug problem isn't drug policy, it's social policy. If we build a society where people feel supported instead of desperate, we'll do away with most of the 'demand' side of the equation.",1

Na noite seguinte, o irm√É¬£o e agente do melhor jogador do mundo, eleito [pela ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/clubes-aprovam-e-brasileiro-de-2019-tera-arbitro-de-video.shtml)[Fifa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/clubes-aprovam-e-brasileiro-de-2019-tera-arbitro-de-video.shtml) nos dois anos anteriores, jantou em Paris com dirigentes do Gr√É¬™mio. Quem estava na mesa espantou-se com uma frase dita no √É¬°pice da emo√É¬ß√É¬£o: √¢¬Ä¬úAgora, [meu irm√É¬£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/01/com-passaporte-apreendido-ronaldinho-e-chamado-de-heroi-por-governador-do-rio.shtml) vai escolher seus jogos.√¢¬Ä¬ù

 Como est√É¬°vamos a 25 dias da estreia da sele√É¬ß√É¬£o na Copa do Mundo, perdida em Frankfurt, e como o resto da hist√É¬≥ria j√É¬° se conhece, √É¬© justo ouvir uma observa√É¬ß√É¬£o de um dos dirigentes gremistas √É mesa, naquela noite: √¢¬Ä¬ú√É¬â brincando que se diz muitas verdades.√¢¬Ä¬ù

 Ronaldinho jogou muito bem no [Atl√É¬©tico-MG](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/onde-assistir-aos-jogos-da-segunda-fase-da-copa-do-brasil.shtml), mas nunca mais foi o mesmo. √É¬â o maior desperd√É¬≠cio de talento deste s√É¬©culo no futebol mundial. Mas n√É¬£o o √É¬∫nico.

 Adriano admitiu no programa Conversa com Bial, em 2017: √¢¬Ä¬úEu n√É¬£o consegui completar a minha carreira por inteiro.√¢¬Ä¬ù 

 Ronaldinho Ga√É¬∫cho tinha 34 anos na Copa de 2014. Adriano, 32. Quatro anos mais novos, poderiam tamb√É¬©m ter refor√É¬ßado o mais fr√É¬°gil elenco de sele√É¬ß√É¬£o a disputar uma Copa do Mundo, na √É¬Åfrica do Sul.

 Grafite declarou h√É¬° dez dias que convocaria o Imperador em seu lugar. Ronaldinho podia escolher quem sairia. Kl√É¬©berson, J√É¬∫lio Baptista, Ramires... Qualquer um.

 Se a sele√É¬ß√É¬£o tivesse por mais tempo os dois que desistiram da carreira de alto n√É¬≠vel, [Neymar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/com-mencao-a-neymar-lais-souza-posta-video-de-recuperacao.shtml) n√É¬£o seria estrela solit√É¬°ria desde sua primeira convoca√É¬ß√É¬£o. Talvez nem se dedicasse tanto √É s viagens a Mangaratiba, em vez de se recuperar no clube com o qual tem contrato, no mesmo ambiente do elenco que sonha ganhar a Champions. Ronaldinho n√É¬£o inaugurou a era dos craques pop stars, mas simboliza o g√É¬™nio que desiste de tudo.

 Imagine que Messi tivesse jantado com dirigentes do Newell√¢¬Ä¬ôs depois de conquistar sua primeira Champions, em Roma, 2009, e que seu pai afirmasse que, a partir dali, escolheria em quais jogos teria grandes atua√É¬ß√É¬µes. Quando Messi come√É¬ßou sua trajet√É¬≥ria no Camp Nou, discutia-se se Ronaldinho chegaria ao mesmo patamar de Pel√É¬© e Maradona. A Messi falta ser campe√É¬£o do mundo por sua sele√É¬ß√É¬£o, o que consta no curr√É¬≠culo de Ronaldinho Ga√É¬∫cho, coadjuvante em 2002. Tirando Copa do Mundo, Messi √É¬© personagem principal em tudo o que faz.

 O Brasil representa 10% dos jogadores escalados nas oitavas de final da [Champions ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/mbappe-marca-e-psg-abre-boa-vantagem-contra-manchester-united-na-champions.shtml)[League](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/mbappe-marca-e-psg-abre-boa-vantagem-contra-manchester-united-na-champions.shtml), mas tamb√É¬©m √É¬© o pa√É¬≠s que mais desperdi√É¬ßa talentos que ficam ricos cedo demais. Os craques que Muricy definia, dez anos atr√É¬°s, que chegavam aos profissionais com dois celulares e carro do ano. Nenhum daqueles virou craque.

 Messi tem o celular que quiser, a mulher que desejar, o carro que preferir e joga bem (quase) todo jogo h√É¬° 13 anos. Aquele jantar em Paris indica que Ronaldinho √É¬© mais Macuna√É¬≠ma e Messi, argentino que vive na Espanha, se parece com o comercial em que o brasileiro n√É¬£o desiste nunca. 

 ### O pacto do futebol

 Quando a CBF se preocupa em[ propor mudan√É¬ßas favor√É¬°veis](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/clubes-aprovam-e-brasileiro-de-2019-tera-arbitro-de-video.shtml) ao desenvolvimento t√É¬©cnico, os clubes rejeitam. A proposta de limitar a uma mudan√É¬ßa de treinador por temporada do Brasileiro era at√É¬© t√É¬≠mida.

 Deveria ser como na It√É¬°lia, onde n√É¬£o se pode contratar treinador de S√É¬©rie A se demitir durante o campeonato. Mudar t√É¬©cnico n√É¬£o √É¬© a √É¬∫nica medida para melhorar o n√É¬≠vel t√É¬©cnico do campeonato, mas √É¬© uma delas. Quanto mais se investir em manuten√É¬ß√É¬£o de elencos e de comiss√É¬µes t√É¬©cnicas maior a possibilidade de ter times mais s√É¬≥lidos.

 A CBF admite a chance de fazer reuni√É¬µes de avalia√É¬ß√É¬£o depois de cada Brasileiro. Um campeonato √É¬© como uma plantinha, que precisa ser regada a cada dia. Foi assim que a Premier League subiu de n√É¬≠vel ano ap√É¬≥s ano e o Campeonato Espanhol passou a ser conhecido como La Liga.

I also suffer from ptsd due to having blood clots. It becomes something that is on your mind constantly and you become hyper sensitive to all feelings in your body.

So far nobody has figured out how to ""keep society clean"" by spending money on it.  If history is any judge, drug addicts aren't going away because you don't want them to be there.  I'd also like crime to go away rather than spending money on incarceration, but you could hardly argue that getting rid of jails to save money on ""preventing crime"" is such a great idea.

&gt;This entire statement presupposes that legal heroin users won't share needles. Justify that.

Junkies only share needles when needles are unavailable.  If clean needles were plentiful and easy to access they would have no reason to share them.

&gt;'Letting them die"" is all that we will be doing if we make more of their drug available to them.

Most junkies are actually *very good* at managing their dosages and staying alive.  They're basically experts and knowing the line between living and dying because they're walking it all the time.  They're nothing if not resilient.  The reason that they overdose is because the drugs are cut with fentanyl which makes it impossible to gauge dosage correctly.  Yesterdays safe dose today would kill them if their supply was impure because it was cut with fentany.  Giving them clean heroin with predictable purity will cut OD's tremendously.  The OD epidemic happened exactly when fentanyl hit the market.  Prior to the OD's happened, but not at epidemic proportions like they are these days.  The OD epidemic is because of fentanyl.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is, is someone intentionally saying the things to scare people? about a year ago, I forgot to take kratom for months aka ran out of the stuff I liked never ordered.  One day i just quit taking it, (and stopped for a good 2-3 months without even noticing I stopped )  I do no remember withdrawls. This time I am actively monitoring, I am not even feeling full effect of IBS right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know its day 3, but where are the withdrawls i was expecting? personal friends have said the same thing, ""WHAT WITHDRAWLS?""  however you ask on the internet someone says yes.   Detox place I took a friend to, said people have came in for kratom withdrawls.   I asked, was the person on anything else besides kratom, when pressed, they admitted yes they were on fentalyl  before.  I was like what the hell, maybe you can mention that too?  Lady looked at me funny.  Its like they do not want people to know kratom is a cure for this god awful withdrawl problems.

96,2019-02-23 15:01:34+00:00," As sa√≠das de [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/category/cristiano-ronaldo-2/) e de Zin√©dine Zidane do Real Madrid, pouco depois de o clube espanhol faturar, em maio do ano passado, sua 13¬™ Liga dos Campe√µes da Europa (a terceira consecutiva), nunca foram bem explicadas ou entendidas.

 √â sempre dif√≠cil compreender por que um jogador ou um treinador opta por se desligar de um time quando esse time est√° por cima e quando esse jogador ou esse treinador tamb√©m est√£o por cima.

 Ao decidir [se transferir para a Juventus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/07/cristiano-ronaldo-chega-a-juventus-e-diz-estar-mais-motivado-do-que-nunca.shtml), o excepcional atacante portugu√™s declarou que havia chegado, depois de nove anos vestindo a camisa merengue, ‚Äúo momento de um novo ciclo‚Äù.

 J√° o t√©cnico franc√™s, ao anunciar o adeus, o fez com uma justificativa para l√° de enigm√°tica: ‚ÄúSe n√£o vejo com clareza que vamos continuar ganhando, √© melhor mudar para n√£o continuar e fazer besteiras‚Äù.

 Passados mais de oito meses dos acontecimentos, **Ram√≥n Calder√≥n**, ex-presidente do Real (2006-2009), afirmou saber a raz√£o da decis√£o de ambos, em entrevista √† r√°dio Villa Trinidad, da Argentina.

 No caso de Cristiano Ronaldo, disse ele, seriam dois os motivos.

 O primeiro: ‚ÄúCristiano pediu um reajuste salarial depois de vencer a Champions [League], e Florentino recusou‚Äù.

 O segundo: ‚ÄúCristiano tamb√©m ficou bravo porque ouviu que o Real planejava pagar muito dinheiro para ter [Neymar](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/category/neymar-2/). Florentino lhe disse que, se chegasse um cheque de ‚Ç¨ 100 milh√µes, ele o deixaria partir, e foi o que aconteceu‚Äù.

 Em julho, houve o an√∫ncio de que a Juventus, da It√°lia, pagou exatamente essa quantia ao Real pelo portugu√™s.

 O Florentino mencionado por Calder√≥n √© Florentino P√©rez, presidente do Real desde 2009.

 O ex-presidente declarou ainda que P√©rez nunca aceitou que Cristiano Ronaldo n√£o havia sido uma contrata√ß√£o dele, mas da gest√£o anterior, ou seja, de Calder√≥n.

 Em rela√ß√£o a Zidane, Calder√≥n relatou que o treinador estava desesperado para manter o cinco vezes melhor do mundo no elenco e para que o gal√™s Gareth Bale, [mais cara aquisi√ß√£o da hist√≥ria do Real](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2016/01/23/o-contrato-de-bale-e-o-ego-de-cristiano-ronaldo/) (‚Ç¨ 100 milh√µes, em 2013), fosse vendido.

 ‚ÄúO presidente fez o oposto‚Äù, afirmou o ex-dirigente ao site americano Bleacher Report. ‚ÄúZidane tamb√©m queria contratar alguns jogadores e negociar outros al√©m de Bale, mas ele n√£o conseguiu, ent√£o decidiu sair.‚Äù

 Essa √© a vers√£o de Calder√≥n, e n√£o d√° para saber se √© verdadeira. √â necess√°rio que mais gente a corrobore.

 O que √© poss√≠vel, por ora, √© relembrar os fatos.

 Eu acompanhei in loco em Kiev (Ucr√¢nia) a decis√£o da Champions League 2017/2018, quando Cristiano Ronaldo n√£o teve um grande desempenho e Bale foi o nome do jogo ao entrar no segundo tempo e fazer dois gols no [triunfo por 3 a 1 sobre o Liverpool](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/05/real-madrid-derrota-liverpool-e-ganha-liga-dos-campeoes-pela-3a-vez-seguida.shtml).

 Ap√≥s a partida, o gal√™s deixou transparecer, em meio a sorrisos pela conquista, insatisfa√ß√£o por Zidane n√£o o escalar como titular ‚Äì n√£o apenas naquela final, mas em partidas anteriores. Deu a entender que, se a situa√ß√£o n√£o mudasse, [avaliaria deixar o Real](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/05/heroi-da-final-da-liga-dos-campeoes-fala-em-sair-cristiano-ronaldo-tambem.shtml).

 Zidane, por seu lado, mostrava preocupa√ß√£o com declara√ß√£o de Cristiano Ronaldo, feita ao t√©rmino do jogo, em tom de despedida, de que ‚Äúfoi muito bonito estar no Real Madrid‚Äù. O franc√™s afirmou que o CR7 deveria ficar.

 O que aconteceu depois?

 Zidane saiu, [quase de imediato](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/05/31/zidane-foi-no-real-madrid-um-estrategista-na-arte-de-ganhar-titulos/), bem antes de Cristiano Ronaldo, que chegou a blefar para a torcida, [dizendo que ficaria](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/05/28/cristiano-ronaldo-muda-de-ideia-sobre-o-futuro-nao-ha-surpresa-no-fico/), em festa na capital espanhola. Quem permaneceu foi Bale.

 Ou seja, a narra√ß√£o de Calder√≥n tem alguma sustenta√ß√£o, n√£o h√° absurdos nela, mas faria mais sentido caso Zidane se desligasse do Real em momento posterior ao CR7.

 A n√£o ser que Zidane tivesse a n√≠tida sensa√ß√£o, e isso s√≥ se tem ao estar dia a dia no clube, de que seu artilheiro realmente iria embora. √â plaus√≠vel esse racioc√≠nio.

 Isso exposto, como est√£o hoje os personagens citados por Calder√≥n?

 Zidane, que declarou em setembro que [estava prestes a voltar √† ativa](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/09/12/zidane-declara-que-voltara-logo-a-ativa-mas-em-qual-time/), ainda est√° em per√≠odo sab√°tico. Ventilou-se que assumiria o Manchester United ap√≥s a queda de Jos√© Mourinho, mas n√£o aconteceu.

 Neymar, que de acordo com Calder√≥n teria tido influ√™ncia na decis√£o de Cristiano Ronaldo, continua no Paris Saint-Germain, [em recupera√ß√£o de les√£o](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/01/24/lesao-no-pe-ameaca-estragar-o-bom-inicio-de-ano-de-neymar/).

 Bale tem tido altos e baixos no Real ‚Äì √© assim desde sua chegada ‚Äì, com contus√µes que o impedem de ter uma boa sequ√™ncia de jogos ‚Äì foram nada menos que 18 afastamentos por les√£o desde a temporada 2013/2014. Ele √© muito bom, mas n√£o alcan√ßar√° o estrelato de Cristiano Ronaldo.

 O CR7, astro principal da Juventus, como se esperava, est√° em vias de ser eliminado com a equipe da Liga dos Campe√µes. No jogo de ida das oitavas de final, derrota por 2 a 0, fora de casa, para o Atl√©tico de Madri. Ele precisar√° jogar muito para n√£o amargar uma grande frustra√ß√£o em 12 de mar√ßo, dia do jogo de volta, em Turim.

 Por fim, Florentino P√©rez. Seu Real Madrid, sem Cristiano Ronaldo mas com Bale e Modric ([o atual melhor do mundo](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/09/24/a-vitoria-da-polivalencia/)) jogando bem, [sagrou-se campe√£o mundial em dezembro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/12/real-madrid-goleia-conquista-o-tri-e-confirma-supremacia-europeia.shtml). E segue firme na Champions, sempre a maior prioridade do clube: ganhou por 2 a 1, como visitante, do Ajax na ida das oitavas.

107,2019-02-22 18:24:59+00:00,"Several times nearly died. Car accident in the middle of the night in the countryside on my way to visit a friend on his farm. The initial crash was severe and I have memory loss of most after the intial crash, but the stories came in after from friends and the rescue teams. 

I hit a tree at excessive speed, and wasn't wearing my seat-belt. The impact on my body was devastating especially internally. The tree I hit was in front of a house which was the only one around for miles. The lady who lived there heard the crash, about 1am and got up to investigate. She looked around and didn't see anything and went back to but, but she was unsettled and decided to have another look. This saved my life number one. She circled her house and then saw my car, only because one headlight was still on, even though the car was absolutely totaled. This saved my life number two. She applied extensive first aid, being a retired nurse, a great help. (She also knew me from a previous visit to my friends farm and notified him).

It took nearly two hours for emergency services to arrive and get me to the nearest rural hospital, when while I was being transported, I went into arrest and CPR performed, which revived me. Saved my life number three.  At the hospital they realized my internal injuries was so severe that I needed immediate medivac to the city for trauma treatment. They requested a helo but due to bad weather, none was available. For that night only, a medivac helo was stranded in a nearby town, because of waiting for weather to clear in the city. Saved my life number four. 

I arrived at the city hospital by helo and was in the trauma emergency ward when I awoke to hearing two doctors discussing my case. Conversation was "" we're waiting for this one to pass, internal damage is too significant'.  They looked at me and realized I'd  heard and explained that there was nothing they could do. I had other bad injuries (my jaw was hanging out from a bad gash, my knee was badly lacerated, four broken ribs and a collapsed lung. The major damage was my liver which was obliterated, nothing left of it. The doctor informed me they had an operating theater on standby, but it was of their opinion that I would not survive surgery, so they didn't do it. 

Meanwhile my family was flown in to say goodbye to me, every time I closed my eyes, I thought 'this is it, this is me dying'. After a while, the doctors became uneasy as they thought I should have expired by now and decided to do the surgeries. I awoke in intensive care and for the next week, that same doctor would be at the end of my bed saying 'you should not be here'. Of course during the whole time I was morphined to a great extent that the whole thing seems surreal to me, but here I am.  Four months of  recovery and very thankful to all who saved me. 

Always wear your seat-belt.

P.S. Theory is that I swerved to miss a wombat, which are notorious to the area.

As shady as Purdue is, I can‚Äôt see them diverting any pills to sell on the street. It‚Äôs just to far fetched to think a multi billion dollar company needs to make corner sales. By Purdue, I mean anyone that works for them from top to bottom. 

10,000 divided by 30(30 pills for each script) is 333.333, so that at least 333 full scripts of pills that just went missing?

OxyContin is average around 100-160$ for a full 30 day script at the pharmacy with insurance for the OC 30s, the 10mg for 30 days is around 45-80$ at the pharmacy.

Let‚Äôs say the script to pick up is 120$, 120 Xs 333 is 39,960$, let‚Äôs say the pharmacy gets around 25% of the sale. That would leave Purdue around a 30K profit from those ‚Äú10,000 pharmaceutical OCs‚Äù.

Since Lyme disease stays in the body my ‚Äúlevels‚Äù rose and I ended up getting a new infection from within somewhere! So I was treated for the infection 3 separate times and was diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease. The initial bite and infection paralyzed my right side with excruciating pain. I could not get out of bed on my own, I could not life my head and I had a fever of 104  in the ER with my heart BPM at 138.

(It was supposed to be 50mg at night for 2 weeks then increase to 50mg twice a day) I already increased it before the two weeks and now I definitely need more it‚Äôs just a waste at this point. Not cutting it. And yes! My daughter is 2 months old and she is the weight and size of a 6 month old. Carrying her up the stairs takes me forever and it is agonizing (my knees) my concern is when she gets bigger :( I don‚Äôt want to fall with her!

She also said I have fluid in my knees so I had an X-ray done to make sure bone structure etc is good in the knees and the we will ‚Äúexplore soft tissue damage‚Äù and hopefully get them drained: I‚Äôm 28 years old and I‚Äôm a fkn mess. I didn‚Äôt even mention the back pain. I‚Äôm so sorry for the long reply. I just made an account and found reddit and the people who understand and are also suffering and I feel like a weight had been lifted and I‚Äôm not alone: so thank you for taking the time to read this and talk with me. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1

During treatment you are pretty much in physical survival mode and staying positive just comes with the territory. You can definitely feel a bit sorry for yourself sometimes but then when you see a 10yr old girl with no hair, you put things pretty quickly in perspective. 

I would say to people who are diagnosed that medical science is always improving such that there is also hope. My cancer is quite rare but the doctors had a very clear ‚Äúplaybook‚Äù re treatment and as long as you listen to them and the nurses, you can get through it. Every cancer is different though and the trick really is not to generalise, eg. my 5yr survival rate is 62%, pancreatic is 8% !!.

The process of getting chemo is not painful. It is just liquid they pump into your vein via a canula or in my case, a PICC line. It is really the onset of side effects typically a day or two later (eg nausea, constipation) and the pain caused in the area of the tumour, particularly if you are having radiation as well, that makes it hard. Also, as you go through you chemo cycles, you gradually get worn down to the extent that each new cycle knocks you around more. I remember vividly begging my doctor trying to convince her not to do the last cycle, surely I don‚Äôt need anymore?. Pain management for me was the tricky part, I did not really like morphine and fetanyl just turned me into a zombie. In the end I found putting lignocaine gel down my throat as a topical treatment the most effective pain treatment option.

These are great questions btw. Re the last one, there are hereditary aspects to my cancer but I am the first in my family to have it with the genetic aspect of my cancer most prevalent in southern China. Considering this I would like to thank this is a ‚Äúone off‚Äù family tree wise.

167,2019-02-18 17:12:03+00:00," Falta pouco para as 15h de uma ensolarada tarde de sexta-feira, e o parque de Laugardalur, perto do centro de [Reykjavik](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/islandia/a), est√° praticamente deserto. De vez em quando, um adulto passa empurrando um carrinho de beb√™. Mas, se os jardins est√£o rodeados de casas e edif√≠cios residenciais, e os meninos j√° sa√≠ram do [col√©gio](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/educacion/a), onde est√£o as crian√ßas?

 Sou acompanhada em meu passeio por Gudberg J√≥nsson, um psic√≥logo island√™s, e Harvey Milkman, professor de psicologia norte-americano que leciona na Universidade de Reykjavik durante uma parte do curso. H√° 20 anos, conta Gudberg, os adolescentes islandeses estavam entre os que [mais bebiam](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/alcoholismo/a) na Europa. ‚ÄúNas noites de sexta, voc√™ n√£o podia andar pelas ruas do centro de Reykjavik porque n√£o se sentia seguro‚Äù, diz Milkman. ‚ÄúHavia uma multid√£o de adolescentes se embebedando diante de todos.‚Äù Chegamos perto de um grande edif√≠cio. ‚ÄúE aqui temos a pista de patinagem coberta‚Äù, informa Gudberg.

 Minutos atr√°s, passamos por duas salas onde se joga badminton e t√™nis de mesa. No parque tamb√©m h√° uma pista de atletismo, uma piscina com aquecimento geot√©rmico e, finalmente, um grupo de crian√ßas jogando futebol com entusiasmo sobre grama sint√©tica.

 N√£o h√° jovens passando a tarde no parque neste momento, explica Gudberg, porque eles se encontram nas instala√ß√µes fazendo atividades extra-escolares ou em clubes de m√∫sica, dan√ßa e arte. Talvez tamb√©m tenham sa√≠do com os pais.

 A Isl√¢ndia ocupa hoje o primeiro lugar no ranking europeu sobre adolescentes com um estilo de vida saud√°vel. A taxa de meninos de 15 e 16 anos que consumiram grande quantidade de √°lcool no √∫ltimo m√™s caiu de 42% em 1998 para 5% em 2016. J√° o √≠ndice dos que haviam consumido [cannabis](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/marihuana/a) alguma vez passou de 17% para 7%, e o de [fumantes di√°rios de cigarro](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/tabaquismo/a) despencou de 23% para apenas 3%.

     A Isl√¢ndia ocupa hoje o primeiro lugar no ranking europeu sobre adolescentes com um estilo de vida saud√°vel.

    O pa√≠s conseguiu mudar a tend√™ncia por uma via ao mesmo tempo radical e emp√≠rica, mas se baseou, em grande medida, no que se poderia denominar de ‚Äúsenso comum for√ßado‚Äù. ‚Äú√â o estudo mais extraordinariamente intenso e profundo que j√° vi sobre o estresse na vida dos adolescentes‚Äù, elogia Milkman. ‚ÄúEstou muito bem impressionado com seu funcionamento.‚Äù Se fosse adotado em outros pa√≠ses, diz ele, o modelo island√™s poderia ser ben√©fico para o bem-estar psicol√≥gico e f√≠sico geral de milh√µes de jovens. Isso sem falar dos or√ßamentos dos organismos de sa√∫de e da sociedade como um todo. Um argumento que n√£o pode ser ignorado.

 ‚ÄúEstive no olho do furac√£o da revolu√ß√£o das drogas‚Äù, diz Milkman, enquanto tomamos um ch√° em seu apartamento em Reykjavik. No in√≠cio dos anos setenta, quando trabalhava como residente no Hospital Psiqui√°trico Bellevue de Nova York, ‚Äúo LSD j√° estava na moda, e muita gente fumava maconha. Havia um grande interesse em saber por que as pessoas consumiam certas drogas.‚Äù

 Em sua tese de doutorado, Milkman concluiu que as pessoas escolhiam a [hero√≠na](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/heroina/a) ou as anfetaminas dependendo de como queriam lidar com o estresse. Os consumidores de hero√≠na preferiam se insensibilizar, enquanto os usu√°rios de anfetaminas optavam por enfrentar o estresse ativamente. Quando o trabalho foi publicado, Milkman entrou para um grupo de pesquisadores recrutados pelo Instituto Nacional sobre Abuso de Drogas dos EUA para que respondessem a determinadas perguntas. Entre elas, por que as pessoas come√ßam a consumir drogas, por que continuam consumindo, quando atingem o limite do abuso, quando deixam de consumi-las e quando t√™m reca√≠da. ‚ÄúQualquer aluno da faculdade poderia responder √† pergunta sobre por que come√ßa: √© que as drogas s√£o f√°ceis de conseguir e os jovens gostam de riscos. Tamb√©m √© preciso levar em conta o isolamento e talvez a depress√£o‚Äù, afirma. ‚ÄúMas, por que continuam consumindo? Por isso, passei √† pergunta sobre o limite do abuso... e me iluminei. Vivi minha pr√≥pria vers√£o do ‚Äòeureka!‚Äô. Os garotos podiam estar √† beira da depend√™ncia inclusive antes de tomar a droga, pois o v√≠cio estava na maneira como enfrentavam seus problemas.‚Äù

 Na Universidade Estatal Metropolitana de Denver, Milkman foi fundamental para o desenvolvimento da ideia de que a origem dos v√≠cios estava na qu√≠mica cerebral. Os menores ‚Äúcombativos‚Äù procuravam ter ‚Äúsensa√ß√µes intensas‚Äù e podiam consegui-las roubando calotas de carro, r√°dios e depois os pr√≥prios carros ‚Äì ou atrav√©s das drogas estimulantes. Claro que o √°lcool tamb√©m altera a qu√≠mica cerebral. √â um sedativo, mas primeiro seda o controle do c√©rebro, o que por sua vez pode suprimir as inibi√ß√µes e, em doses limitadas, reduzir a ansiedade.

 ‚ÄúAs pessoas podem se tornar dependentes de bebida, carro, dinheiro, sexo, calorias, coca√≠na... de qualquer coisa‚Äù, diz Milkman. ‚ÄúA ideia da depend√™ncia comportamental se transformou no tra√ßo que nos caracteriza.‚Äù

 Dessa ideia nasceu outra. ‚ÄúPor que n√£o organizar um movimento social baseado na embriaguez natural, em que as pessoas ‚Äòsintam barato‚Äô com a qu√≠mica de seu c√©rebro ‚Äì porque me parece evidente que as pessoas desejam mudar seu estado de consci√™ncia ‚Äì sem os efeitos prejudiciais das drogas?‚Äù

     ‚ÄúPor que n√£o organizar um movimento social baseado na *embriaguez natural*, em que as pessoas *sintam barato* com a qu√≠mica de seu c√©rebro ‚Äì porque me parece evidente que as pessoas desejam mudar seu estado de consci√™ncia ‚Äì sem os efeitos prejudiciais das drogas?‚Äù

    Em 1992, sua equipe de Denver obteve uma subven√ß√£o de 1,2 milh√£o de d√≥lares (3,7 milh√µes de reais) do Governo para criar o Projeto Autodescoberta, que oferecia aos adolescentes maneiras naturais de se embriagar, alternativas aos entorpecentes e ao crime. Os cientistas pediram aos professores, assim como √†s enfermeiras e aos terapeutas de centros escolares, que lhes enviassem alunos. E inclu√≠ram no estudo meninos de 14 anos que n√£o achavam que precisavam de tratamento, mas que tinham problemas com as drogas ou com crimes leves.

 ‚ÄúN√£o lhes contamos que vinham para uma terapia, e sim que lhes ensinar√≠amos algo que quisessem aprender: m√∫sica, arte, dan√ßa, hip hop ou artes marciais‚Äù, explica. A ideia era que as diferentes aulas pudessem provocar uma s√©rie de altera√ß√µes em sua qu√≠mica cerebral e lhes proporcionassem o que necessitavam para enfrentar melhor a vida. Enquanto alguns talvez desejassem uma experi√™ncia para ajudar a reduzir a ansiedade, outros poderiam estar em busca de emo√ß√µes fortes.

 Ao mesmo tempo, os participantes receberam forma√ß√£o em capacidades para a vida, centrada em melhorar suas ideias sobre si mesmos, sua exist√™ncia e sua maneira de interagir com os demais. ‚ÄúO princ√≠pio b√°sico era que a educa√ß√£o sobre as drogas n√£o funciona porque ningu√©m d√° aten√ß√£o a ela. Precisamos de capacidades b√°sicas para levar essas informa√ß√µes √† pr√°tica‚Äù, afirma Milkman. A equipe disse aos adolescentes que o programa duraria tr√™s meses. Alguns ficaram cinco anos.

 Em 1991, Milkman foi convidado para falar sobre seu trabalho, suas descobertas e suas ideias na Isl√¢ndia. Tornou-se assessor do primeiro centro residencial de tratamento de depend√™ncia de drogas para adolescentes do pa√≠s, situado na cidade de Tindar. ‚ÄúA ideia [do centro] era oferecer aos meninos coisas melhores para fazer‚Äù, explica. L√° conheceu Gudberg, que na √©poca estudava Psicologia e trabalhava como volunt√°rio. Desde ent√£o, os dois s√£o amigos √≠ntimos.

 No in√≠cio, Milkman viajava regularmente √† Isl√¢ndia para dar confer√™ncias. Suas palestras e o centro de Tindar atra√≠ram a aten√ß√£o de Inga D√≥ra Sigf√∫sd√≥ttir, uma jovem pesquisadora da Universidade da Isl√¢ndia. Ela se perguntava o que aconteceria se fosse poss√≠vel utilizar alternativas saud√°veis √†s drogas e ao √°lcool dentro de um programa que n√£o tivesse o objetivo de tratar jovens com problemas, mas, sobretudo, de conseguir que eles deixassem de beber e consumir drogas.

 Voc√™ j√° experimentou √°lcool? Se a resposta for afirmativa, quando foi a √∫ltima vez que bebeu? Ficou b√™bado em alguma ocasi√£o? Consumiu tabaco? Se sim, quanto voc√™ fuma? Quanto tempo passa com os seus pais? Tem uma rela√ß√£o estreita com eles? De que tipo de atividade voc√™ participa?

 Em 1992, os meninos e meninas de 14, 15 e 16 anos de todos os centros de ensino da Isl√¢ndia preencheram um question√°rio com perguntas como essas. O processo foi repetido em 1995 e em 1997.

 Os resultados da pesquisa foram alarmantes. Em todo o pa√≠s, quase 25% dos jovens fumavam diariamente, e mais de 40% havia se embriagado no m√™s anterior. Mas quando a equipe se aprofundou nos dados, identificou com precis√£o quais centros tinham mais problemas e quais tinham menos. A an√°lise exp√¥s as claras diferen√ßas entre as vidas dos garotos que bebiam, fumavam e consumiam outras drogas e as vidas daqueles que n√£o utilizavam essas subst√¢ncias. Tamb√©m revelou que havia diversos fatores com um efeito decididamente protetor: a participa√ß√£o, tr√™s ou quarto vezes por semana, em atividades organizadas ‚Äì sobretudo esportivas; o tempo que passavam com os pais durante a semana; a sensa√ß√£o de que os professores do col√©gio se preocupavam com eles; e n√£o sair de noite.

 ‚ÄúNaquela √©poca, houve in√∫meras iniciativas e programas para a preven√ß√£o do consumo de drogas‚Äù, diz Inga D√≥ra, que foi pesquisadora ajudante nas pesquisas. ‚ÄúA maioria se baseava na educa√ß√£o.‚Äù As campanhas alertavam os meninos sobre os perigos da bebida e das drogas, mas, como Milkman observar",1

I tried to tell school staff to take me to a specific hospital because my dad worked there and was a physical therapist who did wound care and dislocations, so I could get it fixed for free. Unfortunately the school had a 'system' and I was taken to a hospital called Detar (which was *right* next to the one I requested to be taken to!). The guy who fixed my knee knew what he was doing and he got it fixed pretty fast (he just twisted my leg and *voila!)*

 Because the hospital my dad worked at was right next to Detar, he arrived very fast. I had to stay in Detar for 45 more minutes so that he could get the paperwork filled out. And that was when I found out about the hospital bill.

The grand total to get my knee fixed (just a simple twist of the leg to move the kneecap back to its normal position) was $5,100 dollars. They injected fetanyl into me, but it was $60, so it hardly contributes to the bill. Under what circumstances does twisting someone's leg cost $5,040?

Doctor just came out of the OR and I could immediately feel something was wrong. She says her appendix was very inflamed and swollen, possibly infected. They removed that immediately, and left the cyst because of risk of sepsis operating close to a possible infection. Also that both ovaries were looking strange and she will need more surgery. They took cultures and tests and it could be cancer or something less serious.

Do **NOT** switch to opioids to try to get off Suboxone. There's a reason Suboxone is used for M.A.T. and not Perocet or Vicodin and that's because those pills are far more addictive and will cause a high.

What dose are you on? Suboxone has only been used in a few small studies for depression and when used for depression-only, the dosage is only like .1 mg or some super low dose like that to prevent addiction. It's pretty shitty that any doctor would think an addictive drug would be a good treatment for depression.

If you want to get off Suboxone, it's really not a big deal to taper. You can taper slowly and have few, if any, withdrawal symptoms or you can do a rapid taper and few like garbage for a few days and then it's done. I had been on 32 mg for years and was tapered off in 4 days at a detox. They just cut my dose in half for 4 days and that was it. I felt horrible for a week but that was it. If you want to taper slowly, you can even use this [taper calculator](http://www.helpmegetoffdrugs.com/taper) and put in your dose and how soon you want to get off them and it will calculate the doses for you.

Whatever you do, avoid adding more addictive drugs and just get off Suboxone the right way.",1

1. ANTIQ. ROMAINE. Officier public charg√© de la r√©daction des contrats et des actes publics. Il existait dans l'Orient grec, et surtout en √âgypte, des notaires publics, qui pouvaient r√©diger les contrats. Il est probable que c'est √† leur imitation que se constitua dans l'Empire la classe des tabellions qu'on trouve √† l'√©poque d'Ulpien avec un caract√®re officiel (Lavedan1964).
2. [Au Moy. √Çge] Officier public faisant office de notaire dans les juridictions subalternes. Il est certain qu'un tabellion d'Andelot (...) requis par messire Jean de Torcenay, bailli de Chaumont (...) se transporta √† Domremy (A. France, J. d'Arc, t. 2, 1908, p. 239).V. scelleur d√©r. s.v. sceller ex.
3. [Sous l'Ancien R√©gime] Fonctionnaire charg√© de mettre en grosse les actes dont les minutes √©taient dress√©es par les notaires. Les tabellions √©taient √† l'origine distincts des notaires: ils gardaient les minutes et d√©livraient des exp√©ditions des actes que r√©digeaient les notaires (MarionInstit.1923).


&gt;B. ‚àí Fam., plais., parfois p√©j. Notaire. √Ä propos, j'ai fait tout ce voyage accost√© d'un brave notaire de province qui a son officine dans je ne sais plus quelle petite ville du midi (...). Aucune conversation possible, bien entendu. Ce digne tabellion sent le papier timbr√© comme le lapin de clapier sent le chou (Hugo, Rhin, 1842, p. 350).Ces pi√®ces de monnaie ne faisaient que passer entre leurs mains, et s'en allaient tout de suite chez le notaire! Ils les alignaient au bord de la table, sous le regard indiff√©rent du tabellion, qui leur griffonnait une quittance sur un bout de papier (Moselly, Terres lorr.,1907, p. 29).",1

As much as Trump wants to get shit done, and does a good job getting shit done (you might or might not like his shit, but he does get it done)... at the same time he's got a bunch of Democrats and their media empire to contend with.

He's currently riding a high in the approval polls, which means he has political capital.  But what should he spend it on?  He could totally blast the wall funding through, and hope he gets it done before his political capital is empty.

The Democrats NEED to #resist, they HAVE to, and they NEED Trump to do something #resist worthy, ESPECIALLY after the SOTU.  They look really bad right now, and he's looking pretty good.

It's... complex.  It's why Trump is in that chair instead of Hillary or Ted Cruz.  He knows how to spin an IMAGE.  He can plot the course of the media with a single tweet.  He takes pressers every time he goes to step on an airplane, taking questions off the cuff.  He spins in real time, without tons of think tanks or sentiment analysis.  It's his superpower.

At the same time, though, he really does believe that these waves of illegal migrants are a danger to this country.  No matter how many terrorists, drug lords, gang members, or tons of drugs they find at the border, it's not enough for the other side to put in barriers to entry.  They're going out of their way to make the border LESS safe.  Now they're demanding fewer beds in detention centers in order to cause overflow in order to release these people into the country.

THEY WANT ILLEGAL MIGRATION AND THEY'LL THROW ANYONE UNDER THE BUS FOR IT.

So Trump is between a rock and a rock.  On the one hand, he needs to time things for maximum media impact, because the media spin machines work 24 hours a day to make him look bad.  On the other hand, these are real problems with real people who get really hurt, and postponing something a day might mean somebody is dead, trafficked, raped, hooked on a drug, killed by fetanyl, or something else.

At the end of the day, I trust him to find the balance.  The first shutdown was a black eye.  He made the collossal mistake of saying he'd take the responsiblity, and let the Democrats run to town with it.  Now he's got a second chance to make a message to the American people.

&amp;#x200B;

...and I think it's possible that when he does get his barrier after all this shit, the anti-borders crowd will look at a landscape of people frustrated by the nonsense, spun by the Trump Media Superpower, under courts which are starting to not be left-leaning rubber stamps, topped by a supreme court which leans conservative for the first time in decades...

&amp;#x200B;

...and they'll have to decide if it's worth actually fighting this fight again, in public, having to stand up for illegal migrants against American citizens.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  As a Republican, I wish he'd just get it over with and get it into the courts.  But there's a lot more going on than just a wall;  there's a thousand whirling sprockets, with media (owned by like 6 people at the top) and politicians cooperating to make him look bad, and a court system which is still pretty anti-Trump.  But every day ticking by gives him a chance to spin it, get more court coverage (the Senate is cranking the judge mill, filling in hundreds of judges on federal courts that the Obama and Bush administrations left open).

Well an opioid is a narcotic pain medication that derived from the poppy plant or man made (semi synthetic), like codeine, oxycotin, herion, morphine and of course fentanyl. The problem is that fentanyl is roughly 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times stronger than herion. A opioid naive ( person who is not already on any opiods and has no tolerance) aka you and your friend, would have overdosed so rapidly ( especially since you smoked it) that you would of had no time and would be so sedated that 1. You would not of really had that much time to have had the said conversation and 2. Your friend who you said had fentanyl in his system would of never been able to walk, run, whatever the said distance was. He would of been in respiratory distress with in 1 to 3 mins after inhaling and would lose consciousness with in 5 at most. So all in all i think you are a liar.

And before you say well maybe it was not that much he smoked, fentanyl is dosed in micrograms. MICROGRAMS. A few grains of salt worth is all that was needed.


And also you could say maybe it wasn't fentanyl, maybe it was another opioid like herion. NOPE. As stated fentanyl is man made ( full synthetic) so it will not show up on a test for morphine/herion or codeine/oxycotin. It needs to be tested separately.",1

Just received 1 of the blisters lagely cause my order got lost and they put instead of 15 1mg Galenika Alprazolam 30 in there plus 1 blister of the 80mg oxycodon hydrochlorid instabt release from Sandoz also for free in there and I know why cause the 128 pcs of the 80mg Sandoz oxy only costs in serbia 20‚Ç¨.  
And they only cost so much if you get them from the pharmacy. The Galenika Diazepam and Alpeazolam always have a blister of 15 pills not like normally 10 pills.And all the packages that get ""hurt"" while packaging and cant be sold get thrown away and the workers there can easily pick them up in cartons of thousands of them and take them home and no one cares. And its the same at Sandoz, dont know 100% if its Sandoz who produces the 80mg in Serbia but a eastern european company also prpduces Oxy 5,7.5,10,20,30,40,80,120mg there too and if a pack gets hurt they just throw them in cartons and then at the end of tgeit shift they should throw them away but no one takes a second look if they really throw they away. Told that story here before a few times but back 3 years I had a serbian friend which uncles worked for Galenika and the Oxy,morphine ect (mainly pain pills) company and he drove regulary to them with his company car and brought in thousands of pills and a brick or maybe two of H #3 and about 100g of H #4. I helped him pack that shit and didnt had to get any H for a month and no benzos for 2 month. Once nearly bevore he ended this thing he got really paranoid and only trust me cause I alwaYs helped him out etc. when all his stuff was gone. So be came back with ahuge loading and we had to pack everytging in 2 day which means wirking 20hours min. After 21 we were done and everything was delivered too. Whuch I normally didnt do but the offer was too good. I received 50g of uncut #3 15g of ubcut #4 120x120mg oxy. And the resg in blisters of oxy: 25x80, 20x40, 50x30 and 30x20, 100x5mg. Which is a heavy amount plus 2000mg of Alprazolam and 200 box s of the rare 25mg Diazepam (Failure of the press machine should be 20m) 1 box contained 120 blister. This was the night of the nights. Acter this his family didnt let him come back to our country cause he was a full blown addict and all I heared is that he now has 2 kids. A great job in IT and overall a good life. ",1

Smartphones und Computer spielen f√ºr die fr√ºhkindliche Entwicklung wohl keine Rolle. Wie sollen Kinder unter 3-6 Jahren beides richtig bedienen k√∂nnen?

Bei so kleinen Kindern sind es wohl eher die Eltern, die - wie beim Fernsehen auch - die Benutzung f√∂rdern weil es dazu f√ºhrt, dass das Kind nicht st√∂rt.

Besser w√§re wohl das Kind (auch damit es alle m√∂glichen Erfahrungen sammelt) immer dabei zu haben und alles mit dem Kind zu machen aber ob das immer realistisch ist m√∂chte ich bezweifeln.

Je mehr man mit dem Kind unternimmt, desto besser ist es f√ºr das Kind. Das √§ndert sich aber in keinem Alter.

&gt; Das Smartphone muss nicht an f√ºr sich sch√§dlich sein, sondern es ist wichtig, dass das Kind noch viel Zeit mit anderen Dingen verbringt.

&gt; Das Smartphone muss nicht an f√ºr sich sch√§dlich sein, sondern es ist wichtig, dass das Kind noch viel Zeit mit anderen Dingen verbringt.

Genau wie 24/7 Fernsehen zu gucken ist 24/7 am Smartphone zu h√§ngen kein guter Plan. Spoiler: Es gibt keine Aktivit√§t die 24/7 eine gute Idee ist, denn es bleibt immer etwas anderes auf der Strecke.

&gt; Hier geht es vor allem um die Bildung von Oxycotin.

Jaja, ich zitiere deinen Beitrag: ""Das richtet ganz viel im Gehirn aus."". Ungenauer geht's wohl kaum.

Wundert mich auch nicht, die meisten Gehirnfunktionen sind kaum verstanden, trotzdem werden die gerne mal als Argument reingeschleudert.

&gt; Das Hormon wird in realen zwischenmenschlichen Kontakten ausgesch√ºttet, nicht aber bei Computerspielen. Zocken im realen Umfeld hingegen ist okay, z.B. Mario Kart auf der Game Cube.

[[citation needed](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

&gt; Je mehr jemand einen Bildschirm nutzt als Jugendlicher, desto weniger Empathie hat er f√ºr √Ñltere und Freunde.

Das jeder vierte Jugendliche gestresst ist liegt wohl weniger am Smartphone als an den gewachsenen Erwartungen die von der Gesellschaft an ihn gestellt werden. Das selbe zeigen regelm√§√üig Studien √ºber das Schulsystem, siehe sp√§te Hausaufgaben die oft √ºberfordern etc.

Genau die selben Vorbehalte hat es gegen√ºber dem Computer in den Generationen davor gegeben und bisher ist die Apokalypse ausgeblieben. Ich erinnere mich noch an die Debatten √ºber z.B. Counter-Strike das die Kinder schon damals verdorben hat, oder auch nicht.

Speziell das bei den jugendlichen in deinem Beitrag angesprochene Verhalten mit der Technologie (""Wenn ich lerne mach ichs aus oder auf lautlos, denn wenn ich lerne dann richtig."") ist ein wichtiger Teil der Bildung f√ºr die Zukunft. Speziell jugendliche in eine H√ºlle ohne Technologie zu h√ºllen bis die Schule vorbei ist und sie dann eiskalt in eine Welt zu kicken in der Smartphones allgegenw√§rtig sind und bspw. ich, im Job, oft besorgt angerufen werde wenn ich eine E-Mail nicht innerhalb einer Stunde beantworte finde ich brutal und sinnlos.

Seine Zeit einzuteilen und priorit√§ten zu setzen ist eine F√§higkeit die in Zukunft immer wichtiger werden wird. (Zum Beispiel um auf Reddit zu diskutieren)

&gt; Smartphones sind schlimmer als Asbest.

Hahahaha

&gt; Alle Kinder haben eine Schlafst√∂rung

Allerdings und zwar dadurch bedingt, dass wir sie entgegen ihres nat√ºrlichen Rhytmus zwingen um &lt;7 Uhr morgens aufzustehen und ab 8 erwarten, dass sie m√∂glichst konzentriert arbeiten k√∂nnen. Das liegt aber nicht an Smartphones.

&gt; Die Quittung werden wir kriegen, die schulischen Leistungen gehen ja jetzt schon runter.

Ja, in den skandinavischen L√§ndern zwar nicht aber da gibt's halt auch keine Spielekonsolen und Smartphones, nicht wahr? Alle anderen Gr√ºnde w√§ren eventuell unbequem, ich denke es werden einfach diese schei√ü Spiele sein. Wie bei Amokl√§ufen.

&gt; Im Waldorfkindergarten gibt es ein Verbot f√ºr alle neuen Medien.

Da zeigt sich doch deutlich worum es geht, nicht um die Sch√§dlichkeit sondern einzig um die Angst vor neuem, sonst w√§re das Verbot ja spezifisch (oder ist das etwa schon die ganze Spezifikation?)

&gt; Studien hinterlegen obige Argumente und Psychologen unterst√ºtzen einen verminderten Konsum von elektronischen Medien bei Kindern und Jugendlichen.

Ja, von diesen Studien habe ich viel geh√∂rt. Sind die denn auch aussagekr√§ftig? Viele dieser psychologischen Studien sind schlecht angefertigt, eine Menge davon niemals wiederholt worden. (wer w√ºrde auch bezahlen etwas zu erforschen f√ºr das es schon eine heilige Studie gibt)

&amp;nbsp;  




**Introductions**  
&amp;nbsp;  




Slave of Yah ‚Äì ‚Äúbriefest of Old Testament prophetic books‚Ä¶  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚ÄúWho was this prophet? ‚Äì where born? ‚Äì of what country? ‚Äì at what time did he prophesy? ‚Äì who were his parents? ‚Äì when, and where did he die? ‚Äì are questions which have been asked from the remotest antiquity; and which, to his day, have received no answer worthy of recording‚Ä¶  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚ÄúWhoever will be at the trouble to collate this short prophecy with the forty-ninth chapter of Jeremiah, will find a remarkable similarity, not only in the sentiments and words, but also in whole verses‚Ä¶.  Whether he copied Obadiah, or Obadiah him, cannot be determined: but it would be very strange if two prophets, unacquainted with each other, should speak of the same event precisely in the same terms.‚Äù (Adam Clarke, The Holy Bible containing the Old and New Testament... with Commentary and Critical Notes, 1831, p. IV 425)  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚ÄúThe political situation implied in the prophecy points to a time after the Exile, probably in the mid-fifth century B.C. ‚Ä¶  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚ÄúThe occasion of the prophecy is the expulsion of the Edomites from their land, which the prophet sees as a divine judgment on that nation for its cruelties toward Israel.  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚ÄúThe first main division (vss. [verses] 1-14) deals with Edom‚Äôs judgment and the moral reasons therefore.  An alliance of surrounding nations is being roused to wage war on Edom (vs. [verse]1*b*).  God‚Äôs purpose is to humble the Edomites‚Äô pride and to rout them out from their supposedly impregnable mountain fortresses (vss. 2-4)‚Ä¶  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚ÄúThe second main section (vss. 15-21 concerns the day of the Lord, which includes universal judgment, the restoration of Israel, and the establishment of the kingdom of God‚Ä¶ Deliverers will arise to lead Israel to victory over Edom (vs. 21*a*).  Thus the kingdom of God will be established (vs. 21*b*)‚Ä¶  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚ÄúThe close verbal parallels between vss. 1-9 and Jer. [Jeremiah] 49:7-22 can be explained only by some literary relationship between the two passages‚Ä¶ The difference in the order of the material makes it likely that both Obadiah and Jeremiah are using an earlier oracle against Edom‚Ä¶  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚ÄúSeveral phrases are also common to Obadiah and Joel‚Ä¶ In 2:32 Joel indicates that he is quoting directly from Obad. ‚Äé[Obadiah] ‚Äé17 by the phrase, ‚Äòas the Lord has said.‚Äô‚Ä¶  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚ÄúThe text of Obadiah is moderately well preserved.  Since vss. 7, 19, 21 are difficult to interpret as they now stand, they may have suffered corruption in transmission.‚Äù (Thompson, 1953, pp. VI 857-859)  
&amp;nbsp;  






**Text and Exegeses**  
&amp;nbsp; 






‚Äú1. Vision [of] `oBaD-YaH [‚ÄúSlave of YHVH‚Äù, Obadiah]:  
&amp;nbsp; 




‚ÄòThus said my Lords YHVH to ‚ÄôeDOM [‚Äúred‚Äù Edom]  


a hearing we heard from YHVH,  


and an envoy in nations was sent forth;  


rise and we will rise upon her to war:  
&amp;nbsp;




-2. ‚ÄúBehold, little I gave you among nations,  


contemptible you are very.  
&amp;nbsp; 




-3. Malignity [of] your heart beguiled you,  


dwellers in clefts of **rock**.  


High [◊û◊®◊ï◊ù, *MehROM*] is his settlement;  


he says in his heart,  


‚ÄòWho will lower [◊ô◊ï◊®◊ì◊†◊ô, *YoReeDayNiY*], me to land?‚Äô   
&amp;nbsp;  







[Figure 1 Petra, the Edomite capital](https://www.reddit.com/r/biblestudy/comments/aolu0j/illustration_for_obadiah_13/?)  
&amp;nbsp;  




-4. If you elevate [◊™◊í◊ë◊ô◊î, *TahGBiYHa*] like an eagle,  


and if between stars is your nest,   


from there I will lower you.‚Äù  


saith YHVH.‚Äô‚Äù  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;‚ÄúThe Edomites lived in ‚Äòretreats of rock‚Äô (Song of S. [Solomon] 2:14), hiding places in canyons and caves.  The translation **rock** interprets *·π£ela‚Äô* as a common noun, alluding to the rugged terrain of the whole region.  There is probably also a secondary reference to **Sela**‚Ä¶ the modern Umm el-Bayy√¢rah, the rock citadel of the ancient inhabitants of Teman‚Ä¶ and of Petra‚Ä¶  apt poetic impressions of the crags, fantastic in shape and color, ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòA rose-red city ‚Äì half as old as Time‚Äô (J. W. Burgon‚Ä¶).‚Äù  (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 861)  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;‚ÄúEdom ‚Ä¶was located in the highlands on the E [east] side of the Dead Sea.  The reddish (Hebr [Hebrew] *‚Äôƒïd√¥m*, ‚ÄòEdom‚Äô; *‚ÄôƒÅdom*, ‚Äòred‚Äô) mountains of Edom, rising higher than 3,280 ft., provided significant military security for the Edomites.  The capital of Edom was Sela (Judg [Judges] 1:36; etc.), a name which means ‚Äòrock‚Äô and which provides a nice instance of paronomasia^1 (the ‚Äòrock‚Äô is both the mountains of Edom and its capital), and of synecdoche^2 (the part, Sela, is used for the whole, Edom).‚Äù (Mallon, 1990, p. 404)  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚Ä¶  


‚Äú7. ‚Äò‚ÄúUnto the border they sent you forth,  


all [the] men of your covenant beguiled you,  


prevailed [◊ô◊õ◊ú◊ï, *YaKhLOo*] to you, [the] men of your peace,  


[those who broke] your bread [with you] have placed a wound beneath you;  


there is no understanding in him.‚Äù‚Äô‚Äù  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;‚ÄúUnder Arab pressure in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. the Edomites were finally driven completely out of their original borders and settled in southern Judah‚Ä¶ The Arab conquerors had formerly been Edom‚Äôs allies in raids on Judah (Ps. [Psalm] 83:6).‚Äù (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 862)  
&amp;nbsp;  



‚Ä¶  


‚Äú10. ‚Äò‚ÄúFrom violence [against] your brother Ya-`aQOB [‚ÄúYHVH Followed‚Äù, Jacob] you are covered in  shame, and are cut off to world.‚Äù‚Äô‚Äù  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;‚ÄúThis doom was ultimately fulfilled when the Idumeans (the Grecianized name for this people) were conquered by the Jews under John Hyrcanus (134-104 B.C.) and ceased to have a separate national existence (Josephus *Antiquities* XIII. 9. 1).‚Äù (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 863)  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;However, Herod the Great was an Idumean; his dynasty was created and exterminated by the Romans.  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚Äú11. ‚Äò‚ÄúIn a day you stood from against,  


in a day captured, strangers, his forces,  


and foreigners came [to] his gates  


and upon Jerusalem handed lots;  


also you are as one of them.‚Äù‚Äô‚Äù  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;‚ÄúAccording to I Esdras 4:45, the Edomites took an active part with the Chaldeans in the invasion and plundering of Judah, which reached its climax in the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 B.C.  The spoil was divided by lot (as in Joel 3:3).‚Äù (Thompson, 1953, pp. VI 863-864)  
&amp;nbsp;  




‚Äú12. ‚Äò‚ÄúAnd do not see in a day [of] your brother, in a day [of] his estrangement,  


and do not be happy to sons of YeHOo-DaH [‚ÄúYHVH knows‚Äù, Judah], in a day [of] their destruction,  


and do not greaten your mouth in a day [of] distress‚Ä¶  


‚Ä¶  


-15. For near is Day [of] YHVH upon all the nations,  


as that you did I will do to you;  


your recompense will redound [◊ô◊©◊ï◊ë, *YaShOoB*] in your head.  


-16. For as you drank upon my holy mountain,  


will drink all the nations always,  


and drink and swallow,  


and be as if they had never been.‚Äù‚Äô‚Äù  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;‚ÄúThe imagery of drinking the cup of God‚Äôs wrath is most fully developed in Jer. 25: 15-28, where the figure is explained as God‚Äôs judgment, first on Judah and then on the pagans.‚Äù (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 865)  
&amp;nbsp;



‚Äú17. ‚ÄòAnd in Mount Zion there will be a refugee,  


and he will be holy,  


and will inherit, House Ya-`aQOB, their inheritance.  
&amp;nbsp;  




-18. And will be, House Ya-`aQOB, fire,  


and House YO√áayPh [‚ÄúIncrease‚Äù, Joseph] flame,  


and House `aySaV [‚ÄúRuddy‚Äù, Esau] straw,  


and they will ignite in them and consume them,  


and there will not be a remnant to House `aySaV,  


for YHVH words.‚Äô‚Äù  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;‚ÄúAfter their return from captivity the Jews‚Ä¶ did break out as a flame upon the Idumeans: they reduced them into slavery; and obliged them to receive circumcision, and practice the rites of the Jewish religion.  See I Macc. [Maccabees] v, 3, &amp;C‚Ä¶ and Joseph. [Josephus] Antiq. lib. xiii, c. 17.‚Äù (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. IV 427)  
&amp;nbsp;  





‚Äú19. ‚ÄòAnd they will inherit the Negev^3 , the Mountain [of] `aySaV,  


and the ShPhayLaH^4 .  


The [◊ê◊™, *‚ÄôeTh*] Philistines: and they will inherit the field [of] ‚ÄôePhRaYiM [‚ÄúFruitful‚Äù, Ephraim] and the field [of] ShoMRON [‚ÄúGuarded‚Äù, Samaria],  


and BiN-YaMiN [‚ÄúSon of Right (or South)‚Äù Benjamin] the GiL`ahD [‚ÄúMound of Testimony‚Äù, Gilead].  
&amp;nbsp;  




-20. And exile [of] this force to sons of YiSRa-‚ÄòayL [‚ÄúStrove [with] God‚Äù,  Israel], who are Canaanites until TsaRPhaTh [15 miles south of Sidon],  


and exile of Jerusalem which is in **√áPhaRahD** [Sardis],    



and they will inherit the cites of the Negev.‚Äô‚Äù  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;‚ÄúThe directions in which the expansion would take place are thus south, west, north, and east.  These conquests were accomplished in the second century B.C., when northern Judah and Benjamin were the nucleus from which the Jews under the Maccabees pressed out into the areas indicated in this verse‚Ä¶  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;‚Äú**Sepharad** is Sardis, *√áparad* in Persian monuments, the capital of Lydia in Asia Minor.  An Aramaic inscription with a parallel Lydian text, found at Sardis, calls this city *·π£prd*, the same consonants as here, and proves the existence of a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth year of Artaxerxes, probably Artaxerxes I Longimanus, king of Persia (465-424 B.C‚Ä¶).  The Peshitta^5 and Targ. [Targum^6] misinterpreted this name as Spain, and consequently Spanish and Portuguese Jews are called Sephardim.‚Äù (Thompson, 1953, pp. VI 866-867)  
&amp;nbsp;



‚Äú21. ‚ÄòAnd will ascend saviors in Mount Zion to judge the Mountain [of] `aySaV,  
&amp;nbsp;



and the kingdom will be to YHVH.‚Äô‚Äù  
&amp;nbsp;



&gt;‚ÄúThese reconquests will be led by saviors who, like the judges of old (Judg. 2:16; 3:9, 15) will deliver the Israelites from their oppressors.‚Äù (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 867)

But if drugs are made legal to manufacture then there will be quality control. Right now, there isn't and so you never know what you're getting or at what dose. Furthermore, education and harm reduction could be made better available it the stigma of illegality isn't there to prevent it.

Most ODs are either the result of relapsing and doing your old dose when your tolerance has lowered or using more than you intend due to stronger than average heroin. That doesn't even take into account the fact that addicts wouldn't be unknowingly shooting up fentenyl when they think it's heroin. And lately, that's been the real killer.

Selling drugs isn't bad. Pharmacies are sell drugs. Pharmacies sell lots of drugs that can kill you too but people are informed and take it safely. There are safe amounts coke you can take and not die.


&gt;People overdosed from taking too much long before fentanyl. Often has to do with when they fall off the wagon after a period of being clean, they pick up where they left off in terms of dose and it‚Äôs too much for their system. As a lot of addicts say ‚ÄúI know I have one more high in me, I don‚Äôt know if I have one more recovery‚Äù.

I disagree. People are not taking fentanyl. It is a legal drug. The reason you hear about fantanyl is because it is cut into coke and other drugs to increase the amount available to be sold. Another reason people OD is because there isn't a safe supply. So they have to buy off multiple dealers which do not have any sort of quality control which leads to different amounts of drugs in each use.

&gt;Simply watching the much better lives of the rest of us who don‚Äôt do hard drugs is all the evidence you need.

&gt;   Mar√≠a Gabriela Chavez es la mujer m√°s rica de Venezuela y su hermana ventila sus d√≥lares; ""Nicolacito"" Maduro suma cargos para los que no est√° preparado. Sus primos, presos por narcotr√°fico. Foto: CedocVenezuela ha vivido en los √∫ltimos a√±os [**un colapso econ√≥mico marcado por la hiperinflaci√≥n**](http://www.perfil.com/tags/crisis-en-venezuela) y la escasez de insumos de primera necesidad. Millones viven en la pobreza, mientras al menos 2,3 millones huyeron del pa√≠s desde 2015, seg√∫n la ONU, que considera este √©xodo el mayor en la historia reciente de Am√©rica Latina. Las multitudinarias protestas contra este sistema dejaron ya m√°s de 40 muertos y unos 1.000 detenidos por las fuerzas armadas de Nicol√°s Maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; Alejados de esa terrible realidad, un grupo de hijos del poder venezolano gastan sus d√≥lares para pagar sus vacaciones en los hoteles m√°s lujosos del mundo. Entre estos ‚Äúni√±os mimados‚Äù del chavismo se encuentra la hija mayor del l√≠der de la revoluci√≥n bolivariana, Hugo Ch√°vez, **Mar√≠a Gabriela, quien se calcula que es la mujer m√°s rica de Venezuela**. Tendr√≠a una fortuna personal de m√°s de 4.000 millones de d√≥lares escondida en cuentas bancarias de Europa.
&gt; 
&gt;  [Mar√≠a Gabriela Ch√°vez](http://fotos.perfil.com//2019/02/05/900/0/maria-gabriela-chavez-639305.jpg)Mar√≠a Gabriela junto a la expresidenta Cristina Kirchner.
&gt; 
&gt; La mujer, de 38 a√±os, gan√≥ su gran fortuna mientras actuaba como primera dama de su padre socialista presidente, el ex teniente coronel Ch√°vez, despu√©s de que se divorciara de su segunda esposa. El fallecido mandatario dijo que Mar√≠a Gabriela fue su ‚Äúheroina‚Äù cuando pidi√≥ ayuda al l√≠der cubano Fidel Castro tras el fallido intento de golpe de Estado de 2002 que pretend√≠a deshacerse de su r√©gimen socialista. Actualmente ocupa el cargo de embajadora alternativa de Venezuela ante las Naciones Unidas en Europa.
&gt; 
&gt; Sin embargo, Gabriela, y otros ni√±os de la elite socialista de Venezuela, **parecen haber olvidado el lema de Chavez: ‚ÄúSer rico es malo, es inhumano‚Äù**. Su hermana menor ""Rosines"" huy√≥ del pa√≠s avergonzada horas de publicar una foto con las manos llenas de billetes de d√≥lares en las redes sociales en 2016. Mientras los maestros venezolanos pr√°cticamente est√°n trabajando gratis y las tasas universitarias est√°n por los techos, Rosines vive en Europa, quiz√°s disfrutando de sus d√≥lares. Se calcula que Ch√°vez dej√≥ a sus hijos una fortuna de US$ 1.800 millones.

&gt; 
&gt;  [Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra](http://fotos.perfil.com//2019/02/05/900/0/nicolas-ernesto-maduro-guerra-639304.jpg)""Nicolacito"" Maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; Por suerte para Maduro, su hijo **‚ÄúNicolacito‚Äù Maduro Guerra** mantiene un perfil mucho m√°s bajo que los dem√°s ni√±os ricos del chavismo, y solamente se meti√≥ en problemas el d√≠a que amenaz√≥ a Donald Trump con apoderarse de la Casa Blanca si el ej√©rcito de los Estados Unidos invad√≠a Venezuela. Dos a√±os antes, el parlamentario hab√≠a sido capturado en un video, en el lujoso Gran Hotel Meli√°, bailando al ritmo de m√∫sica √°rabe mientras le ca√≠a una lluvia de billetes de d√≥lares.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sin experiencia laboral y con un curr√≠culum educativo conservado como secreto de Estado**, Nicolacito es miembro de la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente y su vida pol√≠tica es una suma de los favores paternos. De flautista en una orquesta nacional pas√≥ a ocupar sucesivamente tres altos cargos p√∫blicos en la administraci√≥n chavista -entre ellos, jefe del Cuerpo de Inspectores Especiales de la Presidencia de la Rep√∫blica- desde 2014.
&gt; 
&gt; Tras aquel nombramiento, el joven de veinte a√±os recorri√≥ Venezuela para proclamar alabanzas a los mandatarios chavistas y cr√≠ticas contra los opositores: ""El PSUV va a salvar a la humanidad"", predica el hijo presidencial. Posteriormente, fue nombrado director de la Escuela de Cine de Venezuela, una designaci√≥n pol√©mica. ""El hijo de Maduro no sabe nada del S√©ptimo Arte. De lo que s√≠ sabe es de robar c√°mara"", opin√≥ el dramaturgo venezolano Jos√© Tom√°s Angola. **""El colmo del desprecio y del cinismo"", resumi√≥ un colega**.
&gt; 
&gt; Nicolacito es fruto del primer matrimonio de Maduro. En 2013, el mandatario se cas√≥ con **Cilia Flores, apodada la ‚Äúprimera combatiente‚Äù** y que tambi√©n forma parte de la Constituyente que busca, todav√≠a infructuosamente, cambiar la Constituci√≥n. Flores es una abogada de 60 a√±os que particip√≥ en la defensa de Ch√°vez cuando estuvo preso en 1992. Bajo su tutela, la esposa de Maduro ocup√≥ importantes cargos en el partido y en el Estado, incluida la presidencia del Parlamento.
&gt; 
&gt; El Tesoro de Estados Unidos **[introdujo en su ‚Äúlista negra‚Äù](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/bloomberg/bc-eeuu-sanciona-a-esposa-de-presidente-venezolano-por-corrupcion.phtml) a la primera combatiente**, incluy√©ndola en una larga lista de hombres y mujeres del chavismo relacionados con actividades de corrupci√≥n y narcotr√°fico, violaci√≥n de los derechos humanos o la sistem√°tica destrucci√≥n de la democracia venezolana. Seg√∫n inform√≥, sus tres hijos estuvieron entre los grandes beneficiados de un esquema de corrupci√≥n que sustrajo hasta US$ 1.200 millones de PDVSA.

&gt;  [Maduro Cilia Adela Flores¬†Wife](http://fotos.perfil.com//2018/09/25/900/0/BC-eeuu-sanciona-a-esposa-de-presidente-venezolano-por-corrupcion-N1.jpg)Nicol√°s Maduro y su esposa, Cilia Flores.
&gt; 
&gt; La familia de la primera dama tambi√©n se ‚Äúcolg√≥‚Äù de los petrod√≥lares venezolanos. **Efra√≠n Antonio Campo Flores y Franqui Francisco Flores, sobrinos de Cilia**, fueron encarcelados en 2017 por 18 a√±os cada uno despu√©s de haberlos capturado tratando de contrabandear $ 20 millones en coca√≠na a los EE.UU. a trav√©s de Hait√≠. Al momento del arresto, seg√∫n la periodista venezolana Maibort Petit, los chicos confesaron que el transporte de la droga era supervisado por Diosdado Cabello, uno de los pilares del chavismo, y Tareck El Aissami, vicepresidente de la Naci√≥n.
&gt; 
&gt; **Yoswal Gavidia Flores y Walter Gavidia Flores, hijos de la primera dama**, son considerados por Maduro como sus propios hijos. Los j√≥venes gastar unos 45 mil d√≥lares en una extravagante estad√≠a de 18 noches en el hotel Ritz de Par√≠s, donde las habitaciones cuestan 591 d√≥lares la noche, el equivalente al salario m√≠nimo mensual de 2.000 venezolanos. Los dos hijastros presidenciales tambi√©n fueron vistos en restaurantes de lujo y tiendas de ropa y joyas de Madrid, mientras una de cada doce familias venezolanas se ve obligada a buscar comida en los contenedores de basura.
&gt; 
&gt; Seg√∫n inform√≥ el diario espa√±ol [_**La Raz√≥n**_](https://www.larazon.es/internacional/los-hijos-de-maduro-se-alojan-18-dias-en-el-ritz-en-plena-ola-de-represion-CK15687467) en un art√≠culo titulado ‚ÄúLos hijos de Maduro se alojan 18 d√≠as en el Ritz en plena ola de represi√≥n‚Äù, Yoswal y Walter **gastaron en total unos US$ 46.000 en su estad√≠a en el lujoso Ritz en Madrid**, adem√°s de sus visitas a los mejores restaurantes madrile√±os y tiendas de lujo, calificando sus h√°bitos como ‚Äúun tren de vida al que est√°n acostumbrados desde hace a√±os los dos hermanos, que pasan muchos meses fuera de Venezuela y acostumbran viajar en vuelos privados‚Äù. Los gastos m√≠nimos entre hotel, transporte y compras habr√≠an superado los 40.000 euros.
&gt; 
&gt; La vida loca de Yoswal y Walter se termin√≥ el a√±o pasado cuando junto a su hermano Yosser fueron acusados por el senador estadounidense Marco Rubio de estar involucrados en un plan de lavado de dinero en septiembre de 2018. En la trama habr√≠an transferido m√°s de US$ 600 millones provenientes de PDVSA -la compa√±√≠a petrolera estatal venezolana- a una compa√±√≠a pantalla con sede en Hong Kong controlada por, como los calific√≥ Rubio, ‚Äúconspiradores venezolanos‚Äù. De acuerdo con el senador, **parte del dinero (185 millones de d√≥lares) fue enviado a los tres hijastros de Nicol√°s Maduro**.
&gt; 
&gt; Daniella, hija de Diosdado Cabello y de la ministra de Turismo, Marleny Contreras, completa la lista de ni√±os ricos del chavismo. La hija del revolucionario, involucrado en el extranjero en numerosos casos de lavado de activos y narcotr√°fico, se presenta ante Venezuela como **una ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù y derrocha glamour en sus posteos en Instagram**, donde comparte cari√±osas fotos junto a su padre, rom√°nticas im√°genes con su novio cantante y otras instant√°neas de su trabajo como voluntaria, de su programa de radio y su carrera musical. En junio de 2018, las autoridades estadounidenses dijeron que confiscaron a la chica unos 800 millones de d√≥lares.

I would always prefer drugs that have a medical use aswell. For me:
1.alcohol (96% drinkable)
2.oxycodon/heroin(only 100% ""clean"" heroin. Not from the streets. For pain issues and if you have to flick yourself with needles and a thread). In addition to that pure oxy/dilaudid wouldnt cause any organ damage. There are chronic pain patients who use opioids everyday their whole live and dont die early...
3.weed since it doesnt cause any harm to your organs.
4.any benzodiazepine which is long acting (klonopin,valium..) just if you have a panic attack. And trust me in a shelter it wouldl happen without a doubt. Maybe not in a week month or even a year.

Correct, but walls are not impenetrable. My locks and home, and windows and cameras are still my most effective line of defense. 

Is it your position that we need a border wall? That the security measures we have are not effective? 

I‚Äôll concede that, yes,  *some* of the border does still need updating/repairs for barriers and maintenance. In fact I believe it was 2013/14(?) that $1.3B per year has been budgeted for doing exactly that and we‚Äôve had contractors down there working on it since. I also agree that we should be spending a lot more money on technology and hiring CBP to patrol the border, as well as more immigration judges and immigration personnel to process immigrants, and create technology that we can use to track and monitor migrant workers and asylum seekers. I would be 100% for $5.8B for those kinds of measures. But a wall from one end of the border to the other doesn‚Äôt seem like a prudent way to spend $5.8B. 

For starters, a wall that size would cost exponentially more than $5.8B, and a wall must be constantly maintained and still patrolled- either electronically or with boots on the ground. Second, most of the unwalled territory is in some of the harshest, most desolate parts of the country that is extremely difficult to access with a vehicle, much less on foot. The rates of entry through those areas is so small that I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs even accurate data for it. The land along the border is also privately owned. In my view, ifthose land owners want to fence their own property, they‚Äôre more than free to do so. I‚Äôm not asking the Federal government to come to my house and fence my property to keep bad guys out, why would we presume to tell American landowners that their own land isn‚Äôt there‚Äôs to protect? I know that eminent domain can be a useful and valuable tool, but it should be used sparingly and judiciously. Lastly, I don‚Äôt trust anything that has Trump‚Äôs name on it or comes from one of his ideas. His track record has shown over and over that he cannot be trusted so it‚Äôs hard for me to believe that he doesn‚Äôt have ulterior motives with this project. It‚Äôs so ill conceived and just not practical. It doesn‚Äôt pass the smell test, so to speak. 

I‚Äôm not trying to be antagonist and I don‚Äôt want to fight with you. But I *do* want to try to understand your position and why you might think that a border wall would be the grand fix it is claimed to be. Just this week the largest fentenyl bust in the us was made at a legal POE using the technology most Americans, and the Democrats support. CBP agents also discovered an extensive tunnel by doing on-the-ground reconnaissance. Walls don‚Äôt stop tunnels, and they don‚Äôt stop boats or airplanes or drones or trucks traveling through POE. I‚Äôm just confused about why ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù seems to be the only answer for some. Is this a discussion you‚Äôd be willing to engage with me on? Like I said, I don‚Äôt want to fight, I want to understand this point of view. ",1

Next spray as far as I can see hit another leg, about 5 chests and max of two top of head shots, which with good gear like he had, is survivable.

When he was behind stairs nothing hit.

Your last spray hit a lot of air, left arm three times, and although it was close to head I don't think you hit that.

As shitty as it is, it makes sense. You're using BT so you didn't put enough sustained damage through to hurt his chest and stomach. You maybe blacked both legs (he probably morphined on stairs), but did zero pass through damage to them. His class 4 helmet probably needed 4-7 hits according to the pen chart by nofoodaftermidnight, and you hit a max of 3. You didn't land a face shot which would've killed, and your final spray did enough to black one arm and do pass through damage. (for a whopping ~10 to each vital area)

Realistically against that armor class you had to either accurately spray side/top of head for 4+ shots, go full leg meta (~10+ shots), hit a face shot, or full magdump over 20-25 shots to chest accurately.

1) clean needles decrease the infection rates of HIV... Sharing needles (and other forms of blood to blood contact) has the highest rate of transmission for HIV and thus by providing clean needles (which by the way... Are not expensive at all... Like I don't live in the states so I don't have the stupidly high markup price but I can buy 20 1cc syrunges for around $8 and that's after the store does its markup. Now decreasing the spread of HIV is great because this also means that anyone they have unprotected sex with is less likely to get infected (0% chance is less than the 1% chance) and it also prevents needles from lying around on the ground in the grass for people and kids to step on.

2) overdose prevention. Regardless of whether or not you have public health care, overdoses cost a lot to tax payers. By preventing overdoses you effectively save a ton of money.


Third and finally, many safe injection sites have resources set up for those that want to work towards getting clean... This includes tapering where they will slowly decrease your dose overtime in order to help you kick the addiction (which is one of the best ways to get clean). You also have to take into account that many people with opioid addictions start their addictions on prescription medications, like they might get into a car accident and get prescribed a painkiller like morphine while in the hospital and codeine while at home... But once their prescription runs out they are done cold turkey... Except that opioids have opium in them which can actually cause someone to die if they try to go cold turkey with a physical deoendancy. The solution to get past this is tapering the dose.... Unfortanely for a really long time we didn't know that (and even now many doctors don't taper doses near the end) and as a result many people would come off of their prescriptions and when searching to stop the pain and the withdrawal symptoms they turn to the opioid that is common on the streets... Heroin (which is really similar to morphine... In fact it's more accurate name is dimorphine)




But yeah be ignorant about safe injection sites... Its funny, if you look at Saskatchewan Canada (which recently removed its safe injection sites) you might see something staggering in the statistics... Namely the HIV rates of the province jumped by around 800% so there is that. Just saying. ",1

Por isso personagens femininos do tipo ""bad-ass"" funcionam t√£o bem. Por que refor√ßam essa coisa de Davi vs. Golias.

Usei o exemplo do labirinto do Minotauro, por que o labirinto tamb√©m √© importante. No alien 1 e 2 o predador se esconde pelas espa√ßo-naves e √© um predador muito inteligente, com a possibilidade de vencer a intelig√™ncia humana (detalhe importante para um predador de humanos).

452,2019-02-03 11:06:32+00:00,"Everything you believe is wrong. It's pretty obvious you don't know anything about the drug approval process, or really, medicine in general.

&gt;  Oxycontin is a medicine. It can be used a recreational drug and it has such deleterious side effects that it has caused a drug epidemic.

This is a flat-out lie I'm afraid. You've been reading literal fake news.

While it *is* possible to use it as a recreational drug, it's actually not very popular as such, especially not since they've cracked down on the diversion of drugs to addicts. Indeed, far more people abuse things like fetanyl and heroin. And most of the people who abuse prescription opiates acquire them illicitly.

Contrary to the lies you've read in the media, it turns out that, in real life, prescription opiates are *not* very addictive. They've done studies on this. Even *long-term* usage of opiate drugs for chronic pain has an extremely low addiction rate. Lemme quote:

&gt; [Within this grouping for those studies that had preselected CPPs for COAT exposure for no previous or current history of abuse/addiction, the percentage of abuse/addiction was calculated at 0.19%. For the ADRB grouping, there were 17 studies with 2,466 CPPs exposed and a calculated ADRB rate of 11.5%.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489635)

People without a history of abusing drugs almost never started abusing drugs after using prescription opiates even for *long-term pain*.

Meanwhile, 1 in 9 people who had a history of abusing drugs abused them if they were given access to them.

Opiates aren't the problem; drug addicts are the problem. Drug addicts do abuse opiates, but if you're not an addict, you're not really in danger of becoming one if you're prescribed opiates for pain.

As it turns out, the whole idea that the pharmaceutical industry made a bunch of addicts is a flat-out lie.

Indeed, the abuse of prescription painkillers was mostly done by people who didn't even have valid prescriptions for it, and it got heavily cracked down on.

The real problem is - and always has been - heroin (and various other similar drugs, like fetanyl). They're vastly more dangerous and also give a much better high.

As it turns out, though, ""drug addicts abuse prescription drugs as well when they can"" isn't exactly news. And drug addicts, being irresponsible assholes, want to blame everyone but themselves for their problems.

The fact is that pharma companies weren't making normal people addicts, they were just turning a blind eye towards diversion of prescription drugs to people who abuse drugs. While that's a shitty thing for them to be doing, it was frankly probably better than the alternative - since we've cracked down on it, the addicts have turned back to using more dangerous drugs, though they likely would have done so anyway because, again, better high.

Prescription opiates aren't actually very dangerous drugs when used medically; the biggest problem with them is the fact that you become tolerant to their effects over time. This is actually the main reason why they're not ideal for long-term pain treatment - not because they're addictive, but because they stop being as effective if you use them for a very long time. They're great for things like post-surgical pain.

&gt; Chemotherapy destroys a patient's body and hopefully does more to the cancer than the rest of the body. You probably don't have any issue with those medicines (or any other of a large number that would fall afoul of your logical process).

We don't use heroin medically because it is more dangerous than the drugs we do use. You *can* use heroin as a painkiller and as a sedative (and in fact, they did historically), but it is unacceptably risky compared to safer alternatives these days.

Indeed, that is frequently how drugs work - if you have two drugs, and one of them is much more dangerous than the other, they'll use the less dangerous drug. A big part of modern medical advancement has been drugs with fewer negative side effects.

Of course, some drugs do have rather large negative side effects, and those only get approved if the thing that the drug is treating is worse than the side effects overall. Chemotherapy sucks, but the alternative is death, so the fact that it has really bad side effects is acceptable because the alternative is dying.

And indeed, when you make a new drug, you have to compare it to the older drugs that exist. One of the main reasons why many more drugs fail trials these days is not that they don't work, but that they have worse side effects than the drugs which already exist, or are less efficacious than the drugs that already exist. If you want a new drug approved, it has to beat the drugs that already exist; they won't approve a drug that lowers your blood pressure if it kills 1 in 100 people if the existing drug only kills 1 in 100,000 people.

But the reality is that absolutely no one with even the most basic understanding of medicine would ever say that smoking marijuana was ""medicine"" because you don't fucking do that. The doses of medicines are carefully calculated and tabulated to ensure that they achieve what is known as a theraputic dose. We don't chew on willow bark to treat pain - we give people aspirin tablets.

There are some chemical compounds in cannabis which are useful medically, if refined and purified and administered. Moreover, when this is done, they work a lot better *and* don't have the side effects, *as these substances don't make you high.*

These cannabinoids are interesting medically. But smoking pot is not medicine - the dosage is uncontrolled and you're taking a bunch of random substances together for no reason.

Potheads, like alcoholics, sometimes claim that their drug of choice is medicine for them. But it isn't. It's an addiction. You can drink alcohol to mitigate pain, but only a quack would suggest becoming an alcoholic because your back hurts.

The reality is that ""medical marijuana"" is bullshit, scientifically speaking. It's just an excuse for people to get high and an attempt to legalize weed. It's no different from patent medicine. You know, [like heroin.](https://static.businessinsider.com/image/4ec52974eab8ea002b000009-750.jpg)",1

The fantasies stuck with me. I grew into a ""normal"" hetero guy, became a very masculine biker, but I would dress up in private and fantasize that I was a girl, and tied up at the mercy of a Mistress or Master. I found stories online about men being forced to be women either by an outside force or by a ""voice in the head"", and becoming female sex slaves, and imagined myself in that position. They were just fantasies and I would have never wanted them to be true, it was a horrifying thought. About 10 years ago, I had a psychotic break that was brought on by prescription drugs, namely ambien, ocycontin and alcohol. I was hospitalized and the ambien and oxy removed, and I started to get better immediately. But something weird happened, and the same fantasies I had turned into an obsession, almost as if the obsession took on a life of its own and started to control me.

Addicts use drugs because they either beleive or the drug actually does solve a problem they have temporarily. Can you agree thats true for at least a majority of addicts? 
Take the opioid epidemic for example. People prescribed opioids take them to fix their pain problem temporarily, then often turn to herion if theyre cut off, not because they think ""you know what sounds fun? Herioin""
 the other portion of opioid addicts self medicate as opioids are an amazing antidepressant, antiphychotic, and anti anxiety drugs. They may start as recriational, but continue taking them because they feel it makes thier life better in the begining. If somethings perfect, it cant get better, right?

  As far as getting their drugs on the street..sure, heroin and fentenyl are easy to get on the street but how about Vicodin and OxyContin?i imagine finding a few pills here and there but they would be expensive as hell",1
469,2019-02-02 19:30:08+00:00,"You have no fucking clue what you're talking about. ALL OPIOIDS ARE ADDICTIVE. There is no ""clean"" or ""dirty"" opioid. The street shit gets cut with fentanyl, which is stronger and causes people to OD thinking it's heroin, which is less strong. The hilarious thing to me is people like you all over this thread who have no fucking clue what they're talking about claiming prescription opioids aren't as strong or addictive as ""street"" drugs (also, FYI, diacetylmorphine, which is the chemical name for heroin, is used all over the world in pain management settings, as is fentanyl). Here's a quick FYI, so you'll quit spreading this ignorant misinformation - oxycodone is roughly 1.5x stronger than morphine. PURE, PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE diactylmorphine (heroin) is roughly 2x as strong as morphine, but virtually no one in the street is getting pure heroin. Average purity in the US is roughly 12-35 percent. This means that you are generally getting shit on the street that is WEAKER than morphine, making oxycodone 2-3x stronger than street heroin. ALL OPIATES TRIGGER THE SAME RECEPTORS, CAUSE THE SAME WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS, AT THE SAME SEVERITY DEPENDING ON DOSE.",1

472,2019-02-02 18:01:54+00:00,"to be honest i'm not an expert on heroin but of course fentanyl is dangerous but once again its the same problem. As fentanyl can only come from pharmaceutical industries you have a good mean to control it so even if you find it ont the street you can trace it back (its not like all fetanyl is usefull to drug yourself), and as fentanyl is extremly strong its of course dangerous but you also have an actual antidote that cost almost nothing (and since we're here, that work for heroin too, at least on the opioid part)",1

Mscontin and oxycontin are absolutely at the heart of the issue, and the 'solution' to over-prescription of these drugs was to cut them off, essentially pushing people to feed their addiction from less controlled means.

Its like saying ""the USA murder rate is expected to go up by 40% by 2030"". We have literally zero ideas what changes are going to happen over that time span, what social/political/crime related changes will happen. 

Its entirely possible that opioid deaths will plummet due to a market shortage due to changes in the drug trafficking systems in the third world. Its possible China will crack down on fentantyl production and cut off the supply to the USA. Its possible a new drug will overtake opioids and become the new epidemic (which cocaine and meth are doing [right now](https://d14rmgtrwzf5a.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/od2017-slide01.jpg)).

Generally speaking, pharms are never really even that highly sought because of their relatively high price and low potency, with the exception of oxy/hydro-morphone (Opana/Dilaudid) and a few others (namely fentanyl patches/lollipops).",1

None of my answers are good at this point as they start googling the drug on the phone with me and are finding articles online that the drug gives brain damage. I finally manage to find a nurse to hand the phone to and it turns out okay in the end, but it was a big lesson that I need to softball things sometimes. 

When I first started working as a hospice social worker, many commented on how young I was/looked. I even made a thread on this sub asking for advice.
