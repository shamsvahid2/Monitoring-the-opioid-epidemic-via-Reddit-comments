6,2019-02-28 15:00:03+00:00,"It’s a natural opiate, the (usually powdered) leaves of the mitraganya specioca plant (spelling very wrong..) native to Asia. What makes it different is that it has a built in anti-abuse system. 

If you take a little, you feel mildly stimulated, maybe like tea with anti anxiety effects. Take decent dose and you will most likely experience a mild to moderate opiate buzz but, it’s when you get into the higher doses that I think make this plant amazing for recovering addicts.

When you try to get “fucked up” on kratom (try to get higher then that mild buzz which I would comparable to a low dose percocet) you regret it very quickly.

You start to get a blurr in your eyes, hard to focus. Then comes a rising wave of nausea which will ruin your nice buzz untill you force vomit or just do it naturally once it overwhelms you, then you get to deal with a savage head ache for usually at least an hour. 

This is clearly an overdose, not a life threatening one but most defiantly so. Pot can be just like this, if you see an inexperienced smoker take one toke too many, it can be a harrowing experience but I’m sure we can all see by now, not life threatening for the vast majority of people.

“Why the fuck does this make kratom awesome?” You may be mumbling right now. Well, when people overdose on heroin and most opiates, they die. Very quickly and generally experience nothing. If there’s an afterlife, these people would be BEWILDERED standing at the pearly gates because, from their point of view, it feels like any other “nod” which most opiate users strive to reach. 

This nod is right on the verge of a LETHAL overdose as the doses are not far apart for the classic opiate/opioid substances. Roughly 4x the recreational dose is lethal. 

This means two things. 1) When someone overdoses, they either die or pass out blissfully (comatose, gasping, as their weak lungs struggle to breath) and wake up eventually with no negative effects (apparent to them) 2) Someone try’s to help them with a hit of naloxone (narcan) and they are hurled out of bliss into immediate HARD CORE withdrawal symptoms.

For option one, there’s no “moment of clarity” as there is no negative part to the experience. You either survive without realizing how close you came to death or just check out and that’s all folks, another statistic on CNN.
- so most people keep going and pushing their luck


Number two.. Narcan, ohhhh narcan!
What a godsend, I can’t even imagine how many lives have quite literally been saved with narcan. It works by blocking the pathway that specificly opiate chemicals use to transfer their effect so that any that are currently “plugged in” to your brain, are taken out of the socket and the socket then plugged with one of those child safe plastic stoppers to prevent the pathway from being used for however the narcan lasts. This also makes it useful for maintaining abstinence from opiates because while you are taking the narcan, the opiates can’t “plug in” to the pathway, making most drugs in this class USELESS or counterproductive (instant withdrawal without any high)

Quite often an addict who nearly died resents being woken and would rather have risked death (or even accepted it) rather then be flung into a nightmare that they spend every waking moment of the day trying desperately to avoid, usually at all costs. 

After this experience people usually go one of two ways, they get some much needed help and truly try to get off the smack, or they make sure that next time, they won’t wake up in a ambulance, the would rather NOT WAKE UP AT ALL.

Now with me, I’ve been through the cycle half a dozen times before. No matter how much I wanted to get away from heroin, i didn’t want to get away from that feeling, I might not have wanted to get high out of my mind anymore, but the reason I started using downers was still their (anxiety, multiple skeletal injuries, “adhd”), opiates helped me with all of these but I was gonna die if I kept using street drugs laced with dirt and now FENTANYL. 

So after my last initial detox (2-3 years ago now), I decided I would start a using kratom AND ONLY KRATOM instead. So I did, when i would get urges, I would swig some green sludge and 10 minutes later that familiar feeling started flowing through my limbs eventually calming me.

Sometimes life wouldn’t go so well for me and I’d have the urge to get “fucked up” again (maddening urge), in keeping with my plan to stay off street drugs I tried with kratom, over and over and each time I would get the same result “nice job asshole, you had a nice buzz going but you HAD to overdo it... now your heads ringing ear to ear and anything you ate today just went down the toilet” 

It didn’t take many try’s to associate trying to get fucked up with a really shitty time. Eventually as more and more time passed, I thought more about why I got these urges, what else i could do instead of my go to, all this time using the kratom to keep me “leveled” when I was on the brink. Eventually I did, of course, become physically dependent on kratom but it’s kept me from getting into any nasty shit for the longest time in my life, a trade off I was well prepared for and aware of. 

Kratom gave me time to think, time to learn myself and understand a my compulsions. Today I still take it daily but I finally think I am truly ready to handle life without it as my crutch now and have been lowering my doses down drastically without much discomfort (defiantly nothing compared to methadone or suboxone withdrawal, which where my only other options for long term opiate maintenance.

I have tried cold turkey coming off kratom just to compare it to Fentenyl/dope/OxyContin (my previous detox experiences) and for me at least, it is much more mild in all aspects but given the option, dropping dose down over the course of 2-4 weeks is turning out to be nearly painless (mild waves of discomfort throughout the day, nothing I would have to miss work over.

This worked for me, it might not work for others but, I know that with the state of things in my town and my tendencies, I would not have made it another year through as quite a few people I’ve known from that life, sadly, did not..

Kratom also helps with most opiate withdrawal symptoms, for anyone trying to detox somewhat comfortably.

All in all, it’s been a fucking bitch getting through all this, trial and error, detox and relapse, health problems... it would be nice if someone else benefits from it as well.

To _Anyone_ else who is going through this,
If you need more info and don’t want to post to the topic, feel free to message me directly, I understand that not everyone wants to or can be open about it, personally it helps me to talk to others who know what it’s like to be in that hell hole of dependence and despair as it’s almost impossible to explain in words to someone unfamiliar with the state.

Live long and prosper 🖖🏽

If you have ever been in the studio you would know.  I know your point is going to be “well he drank beers with his friends the night he died, then went and did drugs and drank and abused them while he recorded music and died and it’s because he was abusing. Thing is, that’s not drug addict activity. That is Mac continuing to drink, continuing to do the blow he was enjoying because the song he was making was dope and that blow helped make it dope and continued partying with his friends. What is sad is he continued to party by himself and prob do blow by himself. And I personally think he realized that he wasn’t going to bed because he was so hyped and the blow was soo good and he realized I gotta be up in the morning to do an interview and shot video later so therefore I need to go to bed. He realized then he had a little downer (fentanayl) and he could risk taking a little bump of that in order to go to bed.  Personally I think once he hit the Fent or whatever pill he was told the fent was; I think he realized then he he made a mistake which increased his heart rate from the blow. I think the increased heart rate from blow, the heavy drinking with friends watching the football game and the additional drinking when he was by himself recording music plus the downer he took was just too much. I honestly believe it was complete accident. He was drinking, then they prob passed some blow, that got him in mood to do more blow and make music, if you do more blow you are going to want to drink more, and then you realize it’s too late at the end of the night and wish u can sleep. Well he’s a star and he either has a pill or bag of Fent which he assumes will help sleep. Take that then u feel your heart stop. I personally think that is exactly what happened. Have said that since it happened. I’ll never be over Mac being gone. I think abt Mac at least once a day and I cried when Mac died but not when my grandfather did who I was close with. I honestly believe this is one of the biggest travesties that could have been avoided in our life. Mac will end up going down as someone who impacted music more than most artists. He was not the #1 commercially successful artist but I would bet all I have and say he will go down as one of the most I influential. He made all his own beats and wrote all his own music and wrote all his own lyrics. Who else does that right now

12,2019-02-28 01:01:54+00:00," CÃ´nsul geral da FranÃ§a em SÃ£o Paulo, Brieuc Pont recorre a um pensamento do estilista alemÃ£o [Karl ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/lagerfeld-era-super-heroi-da-moda-que-tornou-imortal-tudo-o-que-tocou.shtml)[Lagerfeld](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/lagerfeld-era-super-heroi-da-moda-que-tornou-imortal-tudo-o-que-tocou.shtml) (1933-2019) para defender a importÃ¢ncia do ensino de francÃªs em um mundo no qual o inglÃªs virou prÃ©-requisito. âEle dizia: hoje em dia, falar sÃ³ duas lÃ­nguas Ã© bregaâ, afirma.

 Filho de diplomata e ex-aluno do LycÃ©e Pasteur, em SÃ£o Paulo, [Pont, 45](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/patriciacamposmello/2018/12/consul-frances-e-vitima-dos-visigodos-digitais-brasileiros.shtml), Ã© um entusiasta de um projeto milionÃ¡rio que serÃ¡ inaugurado nesta semana e pode movimentar o [mercado de escolas bilÃ­ngues](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2019/02/com-mensalidade-a-partir-de-r-1000-ensino-bilingue-chega-ate-a-periferia-de-sp.shtml) na capital paulista.

 Trata-se da fusÃ£o do LycÃ©e, de currÃ­culo bilÃ­ngue, com o [Liceu Pasteur](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/sobretudo/morar/2017/03/1865558-zona-sul-concentra-as-melhores-escolas-da-capital-paulista.shtml), com aulas predominantemente em portuguÃªs, ambos na Vila Mariana (zona sul de SÃ£o Paulo).

 A unificaÃ§Ã£o, com investimento de R$ 150 milhÃµes, incluiu a reforma do prÃ©dio da unidade da rua Mairinque, projetada por [Ramos de Azevedo (1851-1928)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/imoveis/ci250101.htm). Ela irÃ¡ sediar a nova instituiÃ§Ã£o, que passarÃ¡ a ser chamada de Grand LycÃ©e Pasteur.

 O currÃ­culo serÃ¡ o plurilÃ­ngue, jÃ¡ adotado atualmente no LycÃ©e. Todas as aulas serÃ£o em francÃªs, com exceÃ§Ã£o de educaÃ§Ã£o fÃ­sica, mÃºsica, lÃ­ngua portuguesa e histÃ³ria e geografia do Brasil.

 HaverÃ¡ ainda cursos obrigatÃ³rios de inglÃªs e optativos de alemÃ£o, espanhol, grego e latim.

 Prevista para terminar em 2023, a fusÃ£o de currÃ­culos comeÃ§ou em 2018, com a educaÃ§Ã£o infantil, e serÃ¡ gradual para os jÃ¡ matriculados no ensino fundamental no curso brasileiro.

 A mensalidade, na faixa de R$ 3.000 para perÃ­odo integral, ficarÃ¡ abaixo da mÃ©dia de outros colÃ©gios de elite em SÃ£o Paulo, em parte porque o governo francÃªs dÃ¡ um subsÃ­dio de cerca de â¬ 3.000 ao ano por aluno (em torno de R$ 13 mil).

 Pont diz esperar que o valor seja um diferencial. âQueremos ser a melhor escola internacional com preÃ§o acessÃ­velâ, afirma. Sem citar a [Avenues](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2017/08/1910575-escola-com-mensalidade-de-r-8000-ja-tem-2000-pais-interessados-em-sp.shtml), com unidade em SÃ£o Paulo inaugurada no ano passado, ele faz referÃªncia velada Ã escola americana que se propÃµe a formar âlÃ­deres globaisâ e menciona a rede de liceus franceses pelo mundo.

 ""Vejo escola dizendo que cobra mensalidade de R$ 10 mil, mas que o aluno terÃ¡ acesso a mais de cinco unidades pelo mundoâ, afirma. âNosso sistema tem 496 escolas em 137 paÃ­ses.â

 AlÃ©m do crescimento do mercado de escolas internacionais, outra motivaÃ§Ã£o para a fusÃ£o foi a constataÃ§Ã£o de que outros colÃ©gios tradicionais da capital paulista, como o [Bandeirantes](https://abecedario.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2016/10/31/escola-tradicional-de-sp-bandeirantes-elimina-divisao-de-turmas-por-area-e-por-notas/) e o [SÃ£o LuÃ­s](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/03/colegio-sao-luis-se-muda-da-paulista-para-ibirapuera-em-2020.shtml), estavam em transformaÃ§Ã£o, diz o diretor geral do Liceu, ClÃ¡udio Kassab.

 Eles esperam que, com as mudanÃ§as, o nÃºmero de alunos aumente dos atuais 1.600 estudantes para 2.500.

 O objetivo Ã© atrair um pÃºblico que vÃ¡ alÃ©m da comunidade francesa em SÃ£o Paulo.

 Para isso, Pont jÃ¡ tem uma lista de argumentos Ã mÃ£o: em 2050, segundo projeÃ§Ãµes, o francÃªs serÃ¡ a terceira lÃ­ngua mais falada do mundo, e empresas do paÃ­s estÃ£o entre os grandes empregadores estrangeiros no Brasil.

 âFalar inglÃªs Ã© o mÃ­nimo que se exige hoje. Para ter um diferencial e dominar um terceiro idioma falado por milhÃµes de pessoas, qual escolher? ChinÃªs, Ã¡rabe? NÃ³s propomos o francÃªsâ, diz.

 Para convencer as famÃ­lias disso, haverÃ¡ outro incentivo: o ensino de francÃªs para os pais que assim quiserem e desconto na AlianÃ§a Francesa.

 A escola afirma que o conteÃºdo em portuguÃªs nÃ£o serÃ¡ negligenciado, e que o aluno serÃ¡ preparado tanto para vestibulares do exterior como para o de universidades brasileiras.

 AlÃ©m do idioma, o currÃ­culo terÃ¡ ainda outras matÃ©rias com uma pitada francesa.

 Em consonÃ¢ncia com o sistema educacional de seu paÃ­s, filosofia e histÃ³ria sÃ£o consideradas matÃ©rias prioritÃ¡rias, segundo Pont, para que o aluno compreenda o mundo.

 âA [Caverna de PlatÃ£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1996/8/18/mais!/18.html), por exemplo, nos faz pensar na internetâ, afirma, em referÃªncia Ã metÃ¡fora criada pelo filÃ³sofo grego, de homens acorrentados em uma gruta que pensam que a realidade sÃ£o as sombras que veem projetadas.

 Nesse contexto, a tecnologia tem um papel delimitado na escola. Embora esteja presente nos laboratÃ³rios, sistemas de projeÃ§Ã£o e laptops em diversas salas de aula, nÃ£o Ã© protagonista absoluta. âComo dizia [o filÃ³sofo Jean-Jacques] Rosseau, ciÃªncia sem consciÃªncia Ã© a ruÃ­na da almaâ, diz Pont. âTecnologia Ã© muito importante, desde que o aluno tenha consciÃªncia do que estÃ¡ fazendo.â

 A proposta se reflete na reforma do espaÃ§o. O objetivo, segundo a arquiteta Maria Coccoli, foi modernizar o prÃ©dio antigo, que havia sido descaracterizado, mas manter as marcas do tempo.

 Para recuperar o projeto original, a equipe fez uma pesquisa nos arquivos da prefeitura. Entre outras descobertas, encontraram vÃ£os que haviam sido fechados para virar salas de depÃ³sitos.

 Mantiveram algumas caracterÃ­sticas, como o piso de peroba e o armÃ¡rio e a chapeleira da sala dos professores, e recuperaram ou adaptaram outras. A pintura das colunas da biblioteca foi retirada para deixar Ã mostra os tijolos originais. Prateleiras antigas da biblioteca foram sustentar o palco no pÃ¡tio dos alunos.

 Para manter o forro de estuque das salas de aula sem que o barulho dos alunos tomasse conta do ambiente, foram encomendadas placas acÃºsticas da SuÃ©cia.

 Com o investimento, a escola e o governo francÃªs pretendem resgatar o prestÃ­gio da instituiÃ§Ã£o, que tem entre seus ex-alunos nomes como a cantora [Rita ](https://hashtag.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/09/19/tuites-de-rita-lee-sobre-bolsonaro-viralizam-sete-anos-depois/)[Lee](https://hashtag.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/09/19/tuites-de-rita-lee-sobre-bolsonaro-viralizam-sete-anos-depois/) e o maestro JoÃ£o Carlos Martins.

 âPrecisamos reconquistar esse pÃºblico e mostrar que o francÃªs Ã© uma lÃ­ngua moderna dos negÃ³cios e da intelectualidadeâ, afirma o cÃ´nsul, para em seguida voltar a citar o estilista alemÃ£o. âLagerfeld sabia tudoâ, brinca.

I have chronic depression and anxiety because of a chemical imbalance. Xanax fucked me up and made me a zombie, I was exhausted nonstop and less functional overall on it even days after my last dose.

I have autoimmune diabetes and high and low bloodsugars are part of my daily life. When I feel like I'm poisoned from a stress high or severely sick from having very low bloodsugar, I basically suffer for hours until I can get things leveled out again.

Weed replaced a lot of medication that made me unable to function and fucked with my body in irrepairable and expensive ways. Weed helps me with my disabilities by removing symptoms or making them irrelevant. My bloodsugar is very well controlled because my anxiety doesn't send my bloodsugar on insane rollercoasters. Weed doesn't render me functionless like Xanax did. I can **actually do stuff** again when I smoke.

I've never been more on top of chores than when I smoke. I have an easier time pushing my boundaries and bettering myself because I smoke. I've lost weight since I started smoking because I don't stress binge as much as I used to despite the occasional munchies. I lost weight because my pain stopped inhibiting me from doing simple things and the weed makes the pain manageable and less invasive.

Weed is not the devil. It's not an irresponsible habit. I was suffering so much from ""safe"" prescribed medicine that 7 years later I'm still paying for the side-effects that weed never gives me.

Fuck you for saying I'm wrong for relying on weed to medicate myself when conventional medicine fucked me over so much worse and more permanently than weed is ever capable of.",1

While Mexicans make up about 52% of the illegal immigrants in the US, the number of illegal border crossings has [plummeted over the last two decades](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Selected_Unauthorized_Immigration_Statistics.png/400px-Selected_Unauthorized_Immigration_Statistics.png). Since 2007, visa overstays have accounted for a much larger share of the growth in the undocumented immigrant population than illegal border crossings. 

As for the drug epidemic, it seems the vast majority of all drugs smuggled into the country come through designated ports of entry. For example, 85% of all smuggled fentinyl came into the U.S. this way.

Another legendary figure near the top there is ""Starkad, Swedish fighter"" (Starcaterus pugil sueticus), with the Latin also transliterated to the rather idiosyncratic runes of Olaus Magnus on the staffs he's holding.

55,2019-02-25 16:17:56+00:00,"Hydroxyzine is the only antihistamine that I actually enjoy. It's so soothing, whereas dph just  feels so DIRTY. Diazepam (Vallium) is a benzo, and I haven't any experience with those. The closest I've had is alcohol or maybe phenibut (but that's mostly gaba-b, not gaba-a). I've heard people with HUGE success switching to kratom.


It has agonist and antagonist alkaloids which creates a ceiling of effects, where you'll only get the most sick feeling ever and puke, as opposed to dying from respiratory depression or choking on vomit. But for real, when you take twice the dose you can handle of kratom it feels like nicotine OD viciously raped alcohol OD and had a disgusting child that you now have to birth repeatedly out of your stomach for 3 hours. Find your limit by taking a medium dose (3-4g for most adult males with no tolerance to opioidergic drugs), and up it with small increments to test where the effects are best for you.


This antagonist/agonist mix creates an effect ceiling that prevents you from getting too heavily dependent on it. However you should still pay attention to your dose.


By the way, Hydromorphone is also known as Exalgo. It's a Morphine derivative (hence the suffix morphone) as opposed to a codeine derivative (codone). Oxymorphone and hydromorphone are morphine derivatives, Oxycodone and Hydrocodone are codeine derivatives. I wanna try absinthe even though I'm not a *huge* fan of alcohol (though it can be great at times), just to know what it's like.

I know what you mean about the meditative mindset, opioid-like drugs kinda reduce your brain to a blend of homogenous bliss, where barriers and separations between parts of reality kinda mend together as a whole, beautiful painting, where you don't pay attention to each brush stroke and take the whole for what it is. Things seem so much simpler and at ease even just when you get endorphins going.


I see it like heroin is fine; but once you get your brain adjusted, it's no longer heroin, but an entirely different drug. If only drugs could be the same drug as when you started no matter how much you use it.


You sound like you have a good view of your relationship with heroin. I have no doubt you'll be able to recover with vigor if you put yourself to it. You recognize when the good heroin is gone, and when your situation can't be maintained long-term. You're serious about leaving it for the better. I salute you for that.

He was 5'10 and 220 pounds. Went to the gym everyday. His childhood crush who they have been playing Ross and Rachel for 10 years finally started dating and being 100% serious. He was working doing construction. Kneeled down to put some flooring in and got a nail right in his kneecap. Got a really bad staff infection( kept coming back too) he had surgery and was out of commission for a good month or two. In those two months his love of his life walked out on him, his older brother took his own life, and his grandfather he spent 1 day a week with since he was a baby died. Once the pain ended in his kneecap, the pain in his heart kept going. The oxy he was prescribed ran out and he wasn't ready for it to be gone. He tracked down a supplier and started using more and more. He was too ashamed to ever ask for help or receive it. He started to lose weight and I knew something was up. I struggled with addiction and he was right there for me the entire time. He pushed me away. Blocked my number, moved a month later and got a new job. I called his mom for years, she didn't talk to him. I saw him 3 years later. He was barely 120 pounds. This beefy guy had sunken in jaws, barely any weight, and looked like his soul left his body.

 Este ano estÃ¡ fÃ¡cil encontrar usuÃ¡rios do Twitter dizendo que resolveram nÃ£o acompanhar a cerimÃ´nia pela TV para evitar a polÃ­tica. E uma pesquisa com potenciais espectadores descobriu que 39% disseram que talvez nÃ£o assistam Ã entrega dos prÃªmios, pelo mesmo motivo.

 Ãs vezes âpolÃ­tico demaisâ quer dizer discursos de aceitaÃ§Ã£o de viÃ©s partidÃ¡rio evidente. Mas, se o objetivo foi criticar a presenÃ§a de filmes politizados, os fÃ£s aborrecidos tÃªm razÃ£o: os Oscar estÃ£o especialmente polÃ­ticos este ano.

 Analisei todos os 554 candidatos ao Oscar de melhor filme ao longo da histÃ³ria da Academia. ConcluÃ­ que este ano hÃ¡ mais participantes na disputa que enfatizam o lado polÃ­tico que em qualquer dos 75 anos anteriores.

 Ã verdade que em muitos daqueles anos houve menos indicados a melhor filme, mas, mesmo em termos percentuais, 2018 ainda Ã© um dos anos mais polÃ­ticos na histÃ³ria do Oscar.

 Para chegar a essa conclusÃ£o matematicamente Ã© preciso classificar todos os 554 filmes como polÃ­ticos ou apolÃ­ticos, e isso nÃ£o Ã© tarefa fÃ¡cil. Quase todos os filmes poderiam ser interpretados como polÃ­ticos em algum nÃ­vel: a polÃ­tica afeta todo empreendimento humano, e podemos interpretar um filme como comentÃ¡rio sobre um sem-nÃºmero de questÃµes.

 EntÃ£o defini algumas regras bÃ¡sicas. Para ser considerado polÃ­tico para os meus propÃ³sitos, um filme teria que se enquadrar em pelo menos um de cinco critÃ©rios:

  2. Mostrar uma tentativa de conquistar poder polÃ­tico, como em âCidadÃ£o Kaneâ (1941), em que o personagem principal concorre a governador de Nova York;
 4. Mostrar uma discussÃ£o sobre como governar, como Ã© o caso de âMr. Smith Goes to Washingtonâ (1939), em que um homem isolado assume posiÃ§Ã£o contra a corrupÃ§Ã£o no Senado;
 6. Tratar de acontecimentos polÃ­ticos passados ou presentes, como as entrevistas histÃ³ricas mostradas em âFrost/Nixonâ (2008);
 8. Tratar de um conflito entre potÃªncias soberanas, como negociaÃ§Ãµes durante a Guerra Fria em âPonte dos EspiÃµesâ (2015);
 10. Ou tomar posiÃ§Ã£o muito clara sobre uma questÃ£o, como a mensagem antiguerra declarada de âSem Novidade no Frontâ (1930).
  Evidentemente Ã© impossÃ­vel ser perfeitamente objetivo quando se classifica filmes desse modo, mas me esforcei para tratar os tÃ­tulos com coerÃªncia.

 Com essas regras definidas, considero polÃ­ticos seis dos indicados a melhor filme este ano. [âInfiltrado na Klanâ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/11/novo-filme-de-spike-lee-grita-com-imagens-em-trama-sobre-ku-klux-klan.shtml) trata de um complÃ´ da Ku Klux Klan e do movimento do poder negro dos anos 1970.[ âViceâ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/brilhante-vice-dosa-trama-e-humor-para-reduzir-dick-cheney.shtml) Ã© uma recriaÃ§Ã£o estilizada da carreira do ex-vice-presidente Dick Cheney. [âPantera Negraâ reimagina a HQ clÃ¡ssica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/01/pantera-negra-e-o-primeiro-super-heroi-indicado-ao-oscar-de-melhor-filme.shtml) sobre dois primos que disputam o trono de uma superpotÃªncia africana fictÃ­cia. [âA Favoritaâ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/01/em-a-favorita-yorgos-lanthimos-insiste-no-estranhamento-como-gesto-politico.shtml) traz duas mulheres que competem por influÃªncia polÃ­tica sob o domÃ­nio da rainha Ana.

[âRomaâ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/longa-mexicano-roma-desbanca-a-favorita-no-bafta-o-oscar-britanico.shtml) segue um rumo sombrio quando um protesto estudantil na Cidade do MÃ©xico descamba em violÃªncia.

 Entre os indicados para o prÃªmio maior da Academia, apenas dois dramas musicais â[âNasce Uma Estrelaâ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/nasce-uma-estrela-e-o-favorito-do-oscar-segundo-buscas-do-google-no-brasil.shtml) e âBohemian RhapsodyâânÃ£o incluem Ãªnfase polÃ­tica suficiente para ser classificados como filmes polÃ­ticos segundo esses critÃ©rios, se bem que seja possÃ­vel detectar temas polÃ­ticos mais sutis em ambos.

 Com seis filmes de viÃ©s polÃ­tico na disputa, este ano estÃ¡ empatado com 1944 no segundo lugar em nÃºmero, perdendo apenas para os sete filmes indicados em 1943.

 No auge da Segunda Guerra Mundial, Ã© evidente que a polÃ­tica dominava o pensamento tanto dos cineastas quanto do pÃºblico. O vencedor de 1943 foi âMrs. Miniverâ, a histÃ³ria de uma britÃ¢nica no front domÃ©stico. O filme se encerra com um discurso prÃ³-Aliados tÃ£o comovente e persuasivo que o presidente Roosevelt o mandou imprimir e jogar de aviÃµes sobre as Ã¡reas sob ocupaÃ§Ã£o alemÃ£.

 Em 1944 o Oscar de melhor filme ficou com âCasablancaâ, histÃ³ria clÃ¡ssica sobre intrigas polÃ­ticas em tempos de guerra e um americano expatriado relutante em ser herÃ³i.

 Em termos percentuais, 75% dos indicados deste ano trazem temas polÃ­ticos. Com isso, este ano ocupa o sexto lugar, depois de cinco outros anos em que 80% dos indicados a melhor filme tiveram teor polÃ­tico. Para contextualizar essa cifra, vale lembrar que ao longo do conjunto de anos, apenas 38% dos filmes ao todo foram classificados como tendo teor polÃ­tico.

 Mas esse nÃºmero de 38% nÃ£o se manteve estÃ¡vel no tempo. [Ao longo dos 90 anos de histÃ³ria do Oscar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/oscar-de-2019-e-o-que-mais-valoriza-as-biografias.shtml) os dados indicam ano a ano uma alta modesta na porcentagem dos indicados a melhor filme que tratam de questÃµes polÃ­ticas. Nos 30 primeiros anos do Oscar, 34% dos filmes indicados na categoria foram polÃ­ticos; nos 30 anos mais recentes, foram 41%.

 NÃ£o apenas os indicados de 2018 compartilham um tema polÃ­tico, como dois deles chegam a especificamente colocar o rosto do[ presidente Trump na tela](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/01/trump-e-john-travolta-disputam-framboesa-de-ouro-o-oscar-do-pior-do-ano.shtml). A imagem de âTrumpâ aparece brevemente em âViceâ durante uma montagem dos anos 1980, se bem que a intenÃ§Ã£o tenha claramente sido de transmitir uma mensagem mais ampla sobre os pontos em comum entre a polÃ­tica de Dick Cheney e a de Donald Trump.

 Em âInfiltrado na Klanâ, o filme conclui com um flash-forward para o protesto nacionalista branco em Charlottesville. Durante essa sequÃªncia final, Trump faz sua declaraÃ§Ã£o infame sobre âos muitos ladosâ, enquanto Spike Lee sugere que o mal que ele filmou na dÃ©cada de 1970 continua presente hoje.

 Analisando os 554 indicados ao Oscar de melhor filme, identifiquei apenas um outro ano em que um presidente em exercÃ­cio da funÃ§Ã£o Ã© visto duas vezes na tela: 1976, quando Gerald Ford pÃ´de se ver na tela grande duas vezes. Na cena de abertura de âTodos os Homens do Presidenteâ, sobre a investigaÃ§Ã£o do caso Watergate pelo âWashington Postâ, Ford aplaude em pÃ© enquanto Richard Nixon, ainda presidente, entra no Congresso para fazer o discurso do Estado da UniÃ£o. Em âNetwork â Rede de Intrigasâ, uma histÃ³ria cautelar Ã frente de seu tempo sobre o poder corruptor da televisÃ£o, Ford Ã© visto brevemente na TV na sala de controle, atÃ© a tela passar a mostrar o excÃªntrico apresentador Howard Beale.

 Quando chegou o momento da entrega dos Oscar, em marÃ§o de 1977, Ford jÃ¡ havia perdido a PresidÃªncia para Jimmy Carter, e o clÃ¡ssico sobre boxe âRocky â Um Lutadorâ derrotou os dois trabalhos, ficando com o Oscar de melhor filme.

 Vale notar que âRockyâ foi o Ãºnico indicado a melhor filme que pÃ´de ser considerado apolÃ­tico naquele ano. AlÃ©m de âTodos os Homens do Presidenteâ e âNetworkâ, os candidatos naquele ano incluÃ­ram âTaxi Driverâ, cujo protagonista alienado cogita assassinar o presidente, alÃ©m de Woody Guthrie tocando uma canÃ§Ã£o prÃ³-movimento sindical em âEsta Ã© Minha Terraâ.

 Com isso, âRockyâ se torna um de apenas dois filmes apolÃ­ticos a terem vencido em um campo dominado por filmes polÃ­ticos. O outro Ã© âAmadeusâ, de 1984, a histÃ³ria da rivalidade entre Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart e Antonio Salieri.

 Esses dois anos fogem um pouco da norma, porque, historicamente falando, os filmes polÃ­ticos sempre contaram com uma pequena vantagem. Filmes apolÃ­ticos venceram em 15% das vezes que foram indicados, mas no caso de filmes polÃ­ticos foram 19% das vezes.

 Isso pode ser um bom sinal para âInfiltrado na Klanâ, âGreen Book â O Guiaâ, âA Favoritaâ, âRomaâ ou âViceâ. Porque os Oscar ainda sÃ£o muito politizados e nÃ£o dÃ£o sinal de estarem abandonando a campanha.

It also creates the supply. Finally, it's hard for me to believe that situations where someone is prescribed 60 pills per day are ones where that use is safe.

I'm 100% with you on regulation being better than the drug war. That said, I think we in the US are quick with the assumption of ""people are going to use drugs."" That's true to a small extent, but drug epidemics of the sort we've got are largely caused by people not knowing how to thrive in our society. 

If you look at wealthy European democracies, their incidence of drug use is way below ours. I think that's got a lot to do with the fact that there are fewer circumstances to put a person into desperate straits. In the US, one healthcare bill can bankrupt you while leaving you too poor to take the time to fully recover so you're left permanently hurting. The lack of safety net means workers must often push through 60-70 hour weeks at multiple jobs on the regular with many people turning to pick-me-ups much stronger than coffee to get through their routine. If people could survive without pushing themselves to the breaking point and felt like they had control of their lives (at least enough to say 'no' to things that hurt them), they would have less desire for drug use *and* more desire to do other things (after 70 hours worked, your only desire tends to be to not move for a bit and have the tiredness go away).

This is borne out in experiments with rats. When placed in a cage with access to heroin, rats will get addicted to the stuff, eventually preferring it to food or sex. However, if you do the same experiment but the rats are in an environment which is healthy and stimulating for them (room to play, etc.) - they don't end up using it.

The solution to most of our drug problem isn't drug policy, it's social policy. If we build a society where people feel supported instead of desperate, we'll do away with most of the 'demand' side of the equation.",1

Na noite seguinte, o irmÃ£o e agente do melhor jogador do mundo, eleito [pela ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/clubes-aprovam-e-brasileiro-de-2019-tera-arbitro-de-video.shtml)[Fifa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/clubes-aprovam-e-brasileiro-de-2019-tera-arbitro-de-video.shtml) nos dois anos anteriores, jantou em Paris com dirigentes do GrÃªmio. Quem estava na mesa espantou-se com uma frase dita no Ã¡pice da emoÃ§Ã£o: âAgora, [meu irmÃ£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/01/com-passaporte-apreendido-ronaldinho-e-chamado-de-heroi-por-governador-do-rio.shtml) vai escolher seus jogos.â

 Como estÃ¡vamos a 25 dias da estreia da seleÃ§Ã£o na Copa do Mundo, perdida em Frankfurt, e como o resto da histÃ³ria jÃ¡ se conhece, Ã© justo ouvir uma observaÃ§Ã£o de um dos dirigentes gremistas Ã mesa, naquela noite: âÃ brincando que se diz muitas verdades.â

 Ronaldinho jogou muito bem no [AtlÃ©tico-MG](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/onde-assistir-aos-jogos-da-segunda-fase-da-copa-do-brasil.shtml), mas nunca mais foi o mesmo. Ã o maior desperdÃ­cio de talento deste sÃ©culo no futebol mundial. Mas nÃ£o o Ãºnico.

 Adriano admitiu no programa Conversa com Bial, em 2017: âEu nÃ£o consegui completar a minha carreira por inteiro.â 

 Ronaldinho GaÃºcho tinha 34 anos na Copa de 2014. Adriano, 32. Quatro anos mais novos, poderiam tambÃ©m ter reforÃ§ado o mais frÃ¡gil elenco de seleÃ§Ã£o a disputar uma Copa do Mundo, na Ãfrica do Sul.

 Grafite declarou hÃ¡ dez dias que convocaria o Imperador em seu lugar. Ronaldinho podia escolher quem sairia. KlÃ©berson, JÃºlio Baptista, Ramires... Qualquer um.

 Se a seleÃ§Ã£o tivesse por mais tempo os dois que desistiram da carreira de alto nÃ­vel, [Neymar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/com-mencao-a-neymar-lais-souza-posta-video-de-recuperacao.shtml) nÃ£o seria estrela solitÃ¡ria desde sua primeira convocaÃ§Ã£o. Talvez nem se dedicasse tanto Ã s viagens a Mangaratiba, em vez de se recuperar no clube com o qual tem contrato, no mesmo ambiente do elenco que sonha ganhar a Champions. Ronaldinho nÃ£o inaugurou a era dos craques pop stars, mas simboliza o gÃªnio que desiste de tudo.

 Imagine que Messi tivesse jantado com dirigentes do Newellâs depois de conquistar sua primeira Champions, em Roma, 2009, e que seu pai afirmasse que, a partir dali, escolheria em quais jogos teria grandes atuaÃ§Ãµes. Quando Messi comeÃ§ou sua trajetÃ³ria no Camp Nou, discutia-se se Ronaldinho chegaria ao mesmo patamar de PelÃ© e Maradona. A Messi falta ser campeÃ£o do mundo por sua seleÃ§Ã£o, o que consta no currÃ­culo de Ronaldinho GaÃºcho, coadjuvante em 2002. Tirando Copa do Mundo, Messi Ã© personagem principal em tudo o que faz.

 O Brasil representa 10% dos jogadores escalados nas oitavas de final da [Champions ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/mbappe-marca-e-psg-abre-boa-vantagem-contra-manchester-united-na-champions.shtml)[League](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/mbappe-marca-e-psg-abre-boa-vantagem-contra-manchester-united-na-champions.shtml), mas tambÃ©m Ã© o paÃ­s que mais desperdiÃ§a talentos que ficam ricos cedo demais. Os craques que Muricy definia, dez anos atrÃ¡s, que chegavam aos profissionais com dois celulares e carro do ano. Nenhum daqueles virou craque.

 Messi tem o celular que quiser, a mulher que desejar, o carro que preferir e joga bem (quase) todo jogo hÃ¡ 13 anos. Aquele jantar em Paris indica que Ronaldinho Ã© mais MacunaÃ­ma e Messi, argentino que vive na Espanha, se parece com o comercial em que o brasileiro nÃ£o desiste nunca. 

 ### O pacto do futebol

 Quando a CBF se preocupa em[ propor mudanÃ§as favorÃ¡veis](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/clubes-aprovam-e-brasileiro-de-2019-tera-arbitro-de-video.shtml) ao desenvolvimento tÃ©cnico, os clubes rejeitam. A proposta de limitar a uma mudanÃ§a de treinador por temporada do Brasileiro era atÃ© tÃ­mida.

 Deveria ser como na ItÃ¡lia, onde nÃ£o se pode contratar treinador de SÃ©rie A se demitir durante o campeonato. Mudar tÃ©cnico nÃ£o Ã© a Ãºnica medida para melhorar o nÃ­vel tÃ©cnico do campeonato, mas Ã© uma delas. Quanto mais se investir em manutenÃ§Ã£o de elencos e de comissÃµes tÃ©cnicas maior a possibilidade de ter times mais sÃ³lidos.

 A CBF admite a chance de fazer reuniÃµes de avaliaÃ§Ã£o depois de cada Brasileiro. Um campeonato Ã© como uma plantinha, que precisa ser regada a cada dia. Foi assim que a Premier League subiu de nÃ­vel ano apÃ³s ano e o Campeonato Espanhol passou a ser conhecido como La Liga.

However, I am a female and got mine from birth control so I stopped taking it but still deal with chronic clotting which will never go away. I have taken every blood thinner on the market and still clotted so the only option I have left is Lovenox. I have heard horror stories about people taking lovenox and saying that it is the most painful injection, but I honestly don’t think it’s that bad. The pain of a lovenox injection is way less then the pain of having a catheter stuck in my leg and a balloon filled up inside my arteries to stretch them!! The general consensus is that once you have a clot and a filter, then you will most likely have another clot and need “filter maintenance” every 8-10 years. I also suffer from ptsd due to having blood clots. It becomes something that is on your mind constantly and you become hyper sensitive to all feelings in your body. My advice is to try to not take any drugs so you are able to feel the full effect of any pain. That way you can gauge whether or not you are truly experiencing another blood clot.

So far nobody has figured out how to ""keep society clean"" by spending money on it.  If history is any judge, drug addicts aren't going away because you don't want them to be there.  I'd also like crime to go away rather than spending money on incarceration, but you could hardly argue that getting rid of jails to save money on ""preventing crime"" is such a great idea.

Junkies only share needles when needles are unavailable.  If clean needles were plentiful and easy to access they would have no reason to share them.

&gt;'Letting them die"" is all that we will be doing if we make more of their drug available to them.

Most junkies are actually *very good* at managing their dosages and staying alive.  They're basically experts and knowing the line between living and dying because they're walking it all the time.  They're nothing if not resilient.  The reason that they overdose is because the drugs are cut with fentanyl which makes it impossible to gauge dosage correctly.  Yesterdays safe dose today would kill them if their supply was impure because it was cut with fentany.  Giving them clean heroin with predictable purity will cut OD's tremendously.  The OD epidemic happened exactly when fentanyl hit the market.  Prior to the OD's happened, but not at epidemic proportions like they are these days.  The OD epidemic is because of fentanyl.  Period.  Take away the fentanyl and the OD epidemic is done.

 É sempre difícil compreender por que um jogador ou um treinador opta por se desligar de um time quando esse time está por cima e quando esse jogador ou esse treinador também estão por cima.

 Ao decidir [se transferir para a Juventus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/07/cristiano-ronaldo-chega-a-juventus-e-diz-estar-mais-motivado-do-que-nunca.shtml), o excepcional atacante português declarou que havia chegado, depois de nove anos vestindo a camisa merengue, “o momento de um novo ciclo”.

 Já o técnico francês, ao anunciar o adeus, o fez com uma justificativa para lá de enigmática: “Se não vejo com clareza que vamos continuar ganhando, é melhor mudar para não continuar e fazer besteiras”.

 Passados mais de oito meses dos acontecimentos, **Ramón Calderón**, ex-presidente do Real (2006-2009), afirmou saber a razão da decisão de ambos, em entrevista à rádio Villa Trinidad, da Argentina.

 No caso de Cristiano Ronaldo, disse ele, seriam dois os motivos.

 O primeiro: “Cristiano pediu um reajuste salarial depois de vencer a Champions [League], e Florentino recusou”.

 O segundo: “Cristiano também ficou bravo porque ouviu que o Real planejava pagar muito dinheiro para ter [Neymar](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/category/neymar-2/). Florentino lhe disse que, se chegasse um cheque de € 100 milhões, ele o deixaria partir, e foi o que aconteceu”.

 Em julho, houve o anúncio de que a Juventus, da Itália, pagou exatamente essa quantia ao Real pelo português.

 O Florentino mencionado por Calderón é Florentino Pérez, presidente do Real desde 2009.

 O ex-presidente declarou ainda que Pérez nunca aceitou que Cristiano Ronaldo não havia sido uma contratação dele, mas da gestão anterior, ou seja, de Calderón.

 Em relação a Zidane, Calderón relatou que o treinador estava desesperado para manter o cinco vezes melhor do mundo no elenco e para que o galês Gareth Bale, [mais cara aquisição da história do Real](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2016/01/23/o-contrato-de-bale-e-o-ego-de-cristiano-ronaldo/) (€ 100 milhões, em 2013), fosse vendido.

 “O presidente fez o oposto”, afirmou o ex-dirigente ao site americano Bleacher Report. “Zidane também queria contratar alguns jogadores e negociar outros além de Bale, mas ele não conseguiu, então decidiu sair.”

 Essa é a versão de Calderón, e não dá para saber se é verdadeira. É necessário que mais gente a corrobore.

 O que é possível, por ora, é relembrar os fatos.

 Eu acompanhei in loco em Kiev (Ucrânia) a decisão da Champions League 2017/2018, quando Cristiano Ronaldo não teve um grande desempenho e Bale foi o nome do jogo ao entrar no segundo tempo e fazer dois gols no [triunfo por 3 a 1 sobre o Liverpool](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/05/real-madrid-derrota-liverpool-e-ganha-liga-dos-campeoes-pela-3a-vez-seguida.shtml).

 Após a partida, o galês deixou transparecer, em meio a sorrisos pela conquista, insatisfação por Zidane não o escalar como titular – não apenas naquela final, mas em partidas anteriores. Deu a entender que, se a situação não mudasse, [avaliaria deixar o Real](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/05/heroi-da-final-da-liga-dos-campeoes-fala-em-sair-cristiano-ronaldo-tambem.shtml).

 Zidane, por seu lado, mostrava preocupação com declaração de Cristiano Ronaldo, feita ao término do jogo, em tom de despedida, de que “foi muito bonito estar no Real Madrid”. O francês afirmou que o CR7 deveria ficar.

 O que aconteceu depois?

 Zidane saiu, [quase de imediato](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/05/31/zidane-foi-no-real-madrid-um-estrategista-na-arte-de-ganhar-titulos/), bem antes de Cristiano Ronaldo, que chegou a blefar para a torcida, [dizendo que ficaria](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/05/28/cristiano-ronaldo-muda-de-ideia-sobre-o-futuro-nao-ha-surpresa-no-fico/), em festa na capital espanhola. Quem permaneceu foi Bale.

 Ou seja, a narração de Calderón tem alguma sustentação, não há absurdos nela, mas faria mais sentido caso Zidane se desligasse do Real em momento posterior ao CR7.

 A não ser que Zidane tivesse a nítida sensação, e isso só se tem ao estar dia a dia no clube, de que seu artilheiro realmente iria embora. É plausível esse raciocínio.

 Isso exposto, como estão hoje os personagens citados por Calderón?

 Zidane, que declarou em setembro que [estava prestes a voltar à ativa](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/09/12/zidane-declara-que-voltara-logo-a-ativa-mas-em-qual-time/), ainda está em período sabático. Ventilou-se que assumiria o Manchester United após a queda de José Mourinho, mas não aconteceu.

 Neymar, que de acordo com Calderón teria tido influência na decisão de Cristiano Ronaldo, continua no Paris Saint-Germain, [em recuperação de lesão](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/01/24/lesao-no-pe-ameaca-estragar-o-bom-inicio-de-ano-de-neymar/).

 Bale tem tido altos e baixos no Real – é assim desde sua chegada –, com contusões que o impedem de ter uma boa sequência de jogos – foram nada menos que 18 afastamentos por lesão desde a temporada 2013/2014. Ele é muito bom, mas não alcançará o estrelato de Cristiano Ronaldo.

 O CR7, astro principal da Juventus, como se esperava, está em vias de ser eliminado com a equipe da Liga dos Campeões. No jogo de ida das oitavas de final, derrota por 2 a 0, fora de casa, para o Atlético de Madri. Ele precisará jogar muito para não amargar uma grande frustração em 12 de março, dia do jogo de volta, em Turim.

 Por fim, Florentino Pérez. Seu Real Madrid, sem Cristiano Ronaldo mas com Bale e Modric ([o atual melhor do mundo](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/09/24/a-vitoria-da-polivalencia/)) jogando bem, [sagrou-se campeão mundial em dezembro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/12/real-madrid-goleia-conquista-o-tri-e-confirma-supremacia-europeia.shtml). E segue firme na Champions, sempre a maior prioridade do clube: ganhou por 2 a 1, como visitante, do Ajax na ida das oitavas.

107,2019-02-22 18:24:59+00:00,"Several times nearly died. Car accident in the middle of the night in the countryside on my way to visit a friend on his farm. The initial crash was severe and I have memory loss of most after the intial crash, but the stories came in after from friends and the rescue teams. 

I hit a tree at excessive speed, and wasn't wearing my seat-belt. The impact on my body was devastating especially internally. The tree I hit was in front of a house which was the only one around for miles. The lady who lived there heard the crash, about 1am and got up to investigate. She looked around and didn't see anything and went back to but, but she was unsettled and decided to have another look. This saved my life number one. She circled her house and then saw my car, only because one headlight was still on, even though the car was absolutely totaled. This saved my life number two. She applied extensive first aid, being a retired nurse, a great help. (She also knew me from a previous visit to my friends farm and notified him).

It took nearly two hours for emergency services to arrive and get me to the nearest rural hospital, when while I was being transported, I went into arrest and CPR performed, which revived me. Saved my life number three.  At the hospital they realized my internal injuries was so severe that I needed immediate medivac to the city for trauma treatment. They requested a helo but due to bad weather, none was available. For that night only, a medivac helo was stranded in a nearby town, because of waiting for weather to clear in the city. Saved my life number four. 

I arrived at the city hospital by helo and was in the trauma emergency ward when I awoke to hearing two doctors discussing my case. Conversation was "" we're waiting for this one to pass, internal damage is too significant'.  They looked at me and realized I'd  heard and explained that there was nothing they could do. I had other bad injuries (my jaw was hanging out from a bad gash, my knee was badly lacerated, four broken ribs and a collapsed lung. The major damage was my liver which was obliterated, nothing left of it. The doctor informed me they had an operating theater on standby, but it was of their opinion that I would not survive surgery, so they didn't do it. 

Meanwhile my family was flown in to say goodbye to me, every time I closed my eyes, I thought 'this is it, this is me dying'. After a while, the doctors became uneasy as they thought I should have expired by now and decided to do the surgeries. I awoke in intensive care and for the next week, that same doctor would be at the end of my bed saying 'you should not be here'. Of course during the whole time I was morphined to a great extent that the whole thing seems surreal to me, but here I am.  Four months of  recovery and very thankful to all who saved me. 

Always wear your seat-belt.

P.S. Theory is that I swerved to miss a wombat, which are notorious to the area.

Also think there might be a news article about cops now using photos found on phones to try to get prints or palm prints. 

As shady as Purdue is, I can’t see them diverting any pills to sell on the street. It’s just to far fetched to think a multi billion dollar company needs to make corner sales. By Purdue, I mean anyone that works for them from top to bottom. 

10,000 divided by 30(30 pills for each script) is 333.333, so that at least 333 full scripts of pills that just went missing?

OxyContin is average around 100-160$ for a full 30 day script at the pharmacy with insurance for the OC 30s, the 10mg for 30 days is around 45-80$ at the pharmacy.

Let’s say the script to pick up is 120$, 120 Xs 333 is 39,960$, let’s say the pharmacy gets around 25% of the sale. That would leave Purdue around a 30K profit from those “10,000 pharmaceutical OCs”. 

I think Purdue would notice money missing very quickly as well as where the fuck did over 300 prescriptions of Oxycotin go. Most pharmaceutical labs have at least one Government Employee that’s suppose to do the checks and balances, make sure all the quantity and stock is there or they could get shut down faster then you could blink.

Where are you from? I’m from CT. I got the Lyme “infection” 3 times! I was bit by two different ticks that carried the Lyme disease strain within 2 years of each other and then add the 3rd bout of “infection” months after the second bite due to my doctor not putting me on enough doxycycline for the right amount of time. Since Lyme disease stays in the body my “levels” rose and I ended up getting a new infection from within somewhere! So I was treated for the infection 3 separate times and was diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease. The initial bite and infection paralyzed my right side with excruciating pain. I could not get out of bed on my own, I could not life my head and I had a fever of 104  in the ER with my heart BPM at 138.  (They nearly admitted me but gave me IV morphone and a script of Vicodin said wait for the blood work and sent me on my way.. basically saying they didn’t know what the issue was before I went back a second time and they saw the bullseye rash and started antibiotic treatment) The infection caused swelling in the brain SO since then my depression has stayed and worsened and my fibro body pain and joint pain had increased 100 fold: it’s changed me and has never gone away.

The rheumatologist did a panel for autoimmune and I don’t have that but Lyme has been confirmed over and over. The rheumatologist specialist said Lyme can hide in the joints especially the knees and that’s 100% accurate. She confirmed my fibromyalgia and just started treatment. As I stated the dosage isn’t cutting it. The first couple of nights it was great but my body and metabolism is CRAZY I’m already ready to up the dosage but how do I explain this without sounding like a fiend :( I’m on 50 mg twice a day. (It was supposed to be 50mg at night for 2 weeks then increase to 50mg twice a day) I already increased it before the two weeks and now I definitely need more it’s just a waste at this point.

Carrying her up the stairs takes me forever and it is agonizing (my knees) my concern is when she gets bigger :( I don’t want to fall with her!

During treatment you are pretty much in physical survival mode and staying positive just comes with the territory. You can definitely feel a bit sorry for yourself sometimes but then when you see a 10yr old girl with no hair, you put things pretty quickly in perspective. 

I would say to people who are diagnosed that medical science is always improving such that there is also hope. My cancer is quite rare but the doctors had a very clear “playbook” re treatment and as long as you listen to them and the nurses, you can get through it. Every cancer is different though and the trick really is not to generalise, eg. my 5yr survival rate is 62%, pancreatic is 8% !!.

The process of getting chemo is not painful. It is just liquid they pump into your vein via a canula or in my case, a PICC line. It is really the onset of side effects typically a day or two later (eg nausea, constipation) and the pain caused in the area of the tumour, particularly if you are having radiation as well, that makes it hard. Also, as you go through you chemo cycles, you gradually get worn down to the extent that each new cycle knocks you around more. I remember vividly begging my doctor trying to convince her not to do the last cycle, surely I don’t need anymore?. Pain management for me was the tricky part, I did not really like morphine and fetanyl just turned me into a zombie. In the end I found putting lignocaine gel down my throat as a topical treatment the most effective pain treatment option.

These are great questions btw. Re the last one, there are hereditary aspects to my cancer but I am the first in my family to have it with the genetic aspect of my cancer most prevalent in southern China. Considering this I would like to thank this is a “one off” family tree wise.

De vez em quando, um adulto passa empurrando um carrinho de bebê. Mas, se os jardins estão rodeados de casas e edifícios residenciais, e os meninos já saíram do [colégio](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/educacion/a), onde estão as crianças?

 Sou acompanhada em meu passeio por Gudberg Jónsson, um psicólogo islandês, e Harvey Milkman, professor de psicologia norte-americano que leciona na Universidade de Reykjavik durante uma parte do curso. Há 20 anos, conta Gudberg, os adolescentes islandeses estavam entre os que [mais bebiam](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/alcoholismo/a) na Europa. “Nas noites de sexta, você não podia andar pelas ruas do centro de Reykjavik porque não se sentia seguro”, diz Milkman. “Havia uma multidão de adolescentes se embebedando diante de todos.” Chegamos perto de um grande edifício. “E aqui temos a pista de patinagem coberta”, informa Gudberg.

 Minutos atrás, passamos por duas salas onde se joga badminton e tênis de mesa. No parque também há uma pista de atletismo, uma piscina com aquecimento geotérmico e, finalmente, um grupo de crianças jogando futebol com entusiasmo sobre grama sintética.

 Não há jovens passando a tarde no parque neste momento, explica Gudberg, porque eles se encontram nas instalações fazendo atividades extra-escolares ou em clubes de música, dança e arte. Talvez também tenham saído com os pais.

 A Islândia ocupa hoje o primeiro lugar no ranking europeu sobre adolescentes com um estilo de vida saudável. A taxa de meninos de 15 e 16 anos que consumiram grande quantidade de álcool no último mês caiu de 42% em 1998 para 5% em 2016. Já o índice dos que haviam consumido [cannabis](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/marihuana/a) alguma vez passou de 17% para 7%, e o de [fumantes diários de cigarro](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/tabaquismo/a) despencou de 23% para apenas 3%.

     A Islândia ocupa hoje o primeiro lugar no ranking europeu sobre adolescentes com um estilo de vida saudável.

    O país conseguiu mudar a tendência por uma via ao mesmo tempo radical e empírica, mas se baseou, em grande medida, no que se poderia denominar de “senso comum forçado”. “É o estudo mais extraordinariamente intenso e profundo que já vi sobre o estresse na vida dos adolescentes”, elogia Milkman. “Estou muito bem impressionado com seu funcionamento.” Se fosse adotado em outros países, diz ele, o modelo islandês poderia ser benéfico para o bem-estar psicológico e físico geral de milhões de jovens. Isso sem falar dos orçamentos dos organismos de saúde e da sociedade como um todo. Um argumento que não pode ser ignorado.

 “Estive no olho do furacão da revolução das drogas”, diz Milkman, enquanto tomamos um chá em seu apartamento em Reykjavik. No início dos anos setenta, quando trabalhava como residente no Hospital Psiquiátrico Bellevue de Nova York, “o LSD já estava na moda, e muita gente fumava maconha. Havia um grande interesse em saber por que as pessoas consumiam certas drogas.”

 Em sua tese de doutorado, Milkman concluiu que as pessoas escolhiam a [heroína](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/heroina/a) ou as anfetaminas dependendo de como queriam lidar com o estresse. Os consumidores de heroína preferiam se insensibilizar, enquanto os usuários de anfetaminas optavam por enfrentar o estresse ativamente. Quando o trabalho foi publicado, Milkman entrou para um grupo de pesquisadores recrutados pelo Instituto Nacional sobre Abuso de Drogas dos EUA para que respondessem a determinadas perguntas. Entre elas, por que as pessoas começam a consumir drogas, por que continuam consumindo, quando atingem o limite do abuso, quando deixam de consumi-las e quando têm recaída. “Qualquer aluno da faculdade poderia responder à pergunta sobre por que começa: é que as drogas são fáceis de conseguir e os jovens gostam de riscos. Também é preciso levar em conta o isolamento e talvez a depressão”, afirma. “Mas, por que continuam consumindo? Por isso, passei à pergunta sobre o limite do abuso... e me iluminei. Vivi minha própria versão do ‘eureka!’. Os garotos podiam estar à beira da dependência inclusive antes de tomar a droga, pois o vício estava na maneira como enfrentavam seus problemas.”

 Na Universidade Estatal Metropolitana de Denver, Milkman foi fundamental para o desenvolvimento da ideia de que a origem dos vícios estava na química cerebral. Os menores “combativos” procuravam ter “sensações intensas” e podiam consegui-las roubando calotas de carro, rádios e depois os próprios carros – ou através das drogas estimulantes. Claro que o álcool também altera a química cerebral. É um sedativo, mas primeiro seda o controle do cérebro, o que por sua vez pode suprimir as inibições e, em doses limitadas, reduzir a ansiedade.

 “As pessoas podem se tornar dependentes de bebida, carro, dinheiro, sexo, calorias, cocaína... de qualquer coisa”, diz Milkman. “A ideia da dependência comportamental se transformou no traço que nos caracteriza.”

 Dessa ideia nasceu outra. “Por que não organizar um movimento social baseado na embriaguez natural, em que as pessoas ‘sintam barato’ com a química de seu cérebro – porque me parece evidente que as pessoas desejam mudar seu estado de consciência – sem os efeitos prejudiciais das drogas?”

     “Por que não organizar um movimento social baseado na *embriaguez natural*, em que as pessoas *sintam barato* com a química de seu cérebro – porque me parece evidente que as pessoas desejam mudar seu estado de consciência – sem os efeitos prejudiciais das drogas?”

    Em 1992, sua equipe de Denver obteve uma subvenção de 1,2 milhão de dólares (3,7 milhões de reais) do Governo para criar o Projeto Autodescoberta, que oferecia aos adolescentes maneiras naturais de se embriagar, alternativas aos entorpecentes e ao crime. Os cientistas pediram aos professores, assim como às enfermeiras e aos terapeutas de centros escolares, que lhes enviassem alunos. E incluíram no estudo meninos de 14 anos que não achavam que precisavam de tratamento, mas que tinham problemas com as drogas ou com crimes leves.

 “Não lhes contamos que vinham para uma terapia, e sim que lhes ensinaríamos algo que quisessem aprender: música, arte, dança, hip hop ou artes marciais”, explica. A ideia era que as diferentes aulas pudessem provocar uma série de alterações em sua química cerebral e lhes proporcionassem o que necessitavam para enfrentar melhor a vida. Enquanto alguns talvez desejassem uma experiência para ajudar a reduzir a ansiedade, outros poderiam estar em busca de emoções fortes.

 Ao mesmo tempo, os participantes receberam formação em capacidades para a vida, centrada em melhorar suas ideias sobre si mesmos, sua existência e sua maneira de interagir com os demais. “O princípio básico era que a educação sobre as drogas não funciona porque ninguém dá atenção a ela. Precisamos de capacidades básicas para levar essas informações à prática”, afirma Milkman. A equipe disse aos adolescentes que o programa duraria três meses. Alguns ficaram cinco anos.

 Em 1991, Milkman foi convidado para falar sobre seu trabalho, suas descobertas e suas ideias na Islândia. Tornou-se assessor do primeiro centro residencial de tratamento de dependência de drogas para adolescentes do país, situado na cidade de Tindar. “A ideia [do centro] era oferecer aos meninos coisas melhores para fazer”, explica. Lá conheceu Gudberg, que na época estudava Psicologia e trabalhava como voluntário. Desde então, os dois são amigos íntimos.

 No início, Milkman viajava regularmente à Islândia para dar conferências. Suas palestras e o centro de Tindar atraíram a atenção de Inga Dóra Sigfúsdóttir, uma jovem pesquisadora da Universidade da Islândia. Ela se perguntava o que aconteceria se fosse possível utilizar alternativas saudáveis às drogas e ao álcool dentro de um programa que não tivesse o objetivo de tratar jovens com problemas, mas, sobretudo, de conseguir que eles deixassem de beber e consumir drogas.

 Você já experimentou álcool? Se a resposta for afirmativa, quando foi a última vez que bebeu? Ficou bêbado em alguma ocasião? Consumiu tabaco? Se sim, quanto você fuma? Quanto tempo passa com os seus pais? Tem uma relação estreita com eles? De que tipo de atividade você participa?

 Em 1992, os meninos e meninas de 14, 15 e 16 anos de todos os centros de ensino da Islândia preencheram um questionário com perguntas como essas. O processo foi repetido em 1995 e em 1997.

 Os resultados da pesquisa foram alarmantes. Em todo o país, quase 25% dos jovens fumavam diariamente, e mais de 40% havia se embriagado no mês anterior. Mas quando a equipe se aprofundou nos dados, identificou com precisão quais centros tinham mais problemas e quais tinham menos. A análise expôs as claras diferenças entre as vidas dos garotos que bebiam, fumavam e consumiam outras drogas e as vidas daqueles que não utilizavam essas substâncias. Também revelou que havia diversos fatores com um efeito decididamente protetor: a participação, três ou quarto vezes por semana, em atividades organizadas – sobretudo esportivas; o tempo que passavam com os pais durante a semana; a sensação de que os professores do colégio se preocupavam com eles; e não sair de noite.

 “Naquela época, houve inúmeras iniciativas e programas para a prevenção do consumo de drogas”, diz Inga Dóra, que foi pesquisadora ajudante nas pesquisas. “A maioria se baseava na educação.” As campanhas alertavam os meninos sobre os perigos da bebida e das drogas, mas, como Milkman observar",1

I tried to tell school staff to take me to a specific hospital because my dad worked there and was a physical therapist who did wound care and dislocations, so I could get it fixed for free. Unfortunately the school had a 'system' and I was taken to a hospital called Detar (which was *right* next to the one I requested to be taken to!). The guy who fixed my knee knew what he was doing and he got it fixed pretty fast (he just twisted my leg and *voila!)*

 Because the hospital my dad worked at was right next to Detar, he arrived very fast. I had to stay in Detar for 45 more minutes so that he could get the paperwork filled out. And that was when I found out about the hospital bill.

The grand total to get my knee fixed (just a simple twist of the leg to move the kneecap back to its normal position) was $5,100 dollars. They injected fetanyl into me, but it was $60, so it hardly contributes to the bill. Under what circumstances does twisting someone's leg cost $5,040?

Today I get off work with 25 missed calls from her. During her shift she started experiencing so much pain she could barely stand or walk. Luckily she is a nurse at a hospital and her doctor boss person personally took her to the ER. 

After 4.5 hours, 2 doses of fentenyl,  an ultra sound and CT scan they say she has a large cyst on her left ovary, and want to remove it tonight. It’s common and not serious and not to worry. Kinda scary but not bad. 

Doctor just came out of the OR and I could immediately feel something was wrong. She says her appendix was very inflamed and swollen, possibly infected. They removed that immediately, and left the cyst because of risk of sepsis operating close to a possible infection. Also that both ovaries were looking strange and she will need more surgery. They took cultures and tests and it could be cancer or something less serious. 

Now I’m for sure freaking out. It feels fake like this only happens in movies or tv shows. Getting a serious dose of how quickly life/plans can flip. I know she will be ok but still very shocking. Please appreciate the people you have around you, things can change so fast.

Do **NOT** switch to opioids to try to get off Suboxone. There's a reason Suboxone is used for M.A.T. and not Perocet or Vicodin and that's because those pills are far more addictive and will cause a high.

What dose are you on? Suboxone has only been used in a few small studies for depression and when used for depression-only, the dosage is only like .1 mg or some super low dose like that to prevent addiction. It's pretty shitty that any doctor would think an addictive drug would be a good treatment for depression.

If you want to get off Suboxone, it's really not a big deal to taper. You can taper slowly and have few, if any, withdrawal symptoms or you can do a rapid taper and few like garbage for a few days and then it's done. I had been on 32 mg for years and was tapered off in 4 days at a detox. They just cut my dose in half for 4 days and that was it. I felt horrible for a week but that was it. If you want to taper slowly, you can even use this [taper calculator](http://www.helpmegetoffdrugs.com/taper) and put in your dose and how soon you want to get off them and it will calculate the doses for you.

1. ANTIQ. ROMAINE. Officier public chargé de la rédaction des contrats et des actes publics. Il existait dans l'Orient grec, et surtout en Égypte, des notaires publics, qui pouvaient rédiger les contrats. Il est probable que c'est à leur imitation que se constitua dans l'Empire la classe des tabellions qu'on trouve à l'époque d'Ulpien avec un caractère officiel (Lavedan1964).
2. [Au Moy. Âge] Officier public faisant office de notaire dans les juridictions subalternes. Il est certain qu'un tabellion d'Andelot (...) requis par messire Jean de Torcenay, bailli de Chaumont (...) se transporta à Domremy (A. France, J. d'Arc, t. 2, 1908, p. 239).V. scelleur dér. s.v. sceller ex.
3. [Sous l'Ancien Régime] Fonctionnaire chargé de mettre en grosse les actes dont les minutes étaient dressées par les notaires. Les tabellions étaient à l'origine distincts des notaires: ils gardaient les minutes et délivraient des expéditions des actes que rédigeaient les notaires (MarionInstit.1923).


&gt;B. − Fam., plais., parfois péj. Notaire. À propos, j'ai fait tout ce voyage accosté d'un brave notaire de province qui a son officine dans je ne sais plus quelle petite ville du midi (...). Aucune conversation possible, bien entendu. Ce digne tabellion sent le papier timbré comme le lapin de clapier sent le chou (Hugo, Rhin, 1842, p. 350).Ces pièces de monnaie ne faisaient que passer entre leurs mains, et s'en allaient tout de suite chez le notaire! Ils les alignaient au bord de la table, sous le regard indifférent du tabellion, qui leur griffonnait une quittance sur un bout de papier (Moselly, Terres lorr.,1907, p. 29).",1

263,2019-02-13 03:14:35+00:00,"Waited until I could think a bit.  The problem here is... politics.  And optics.  As much as Trump wants to get shit done, and does a good job getting shit done (you might or might not like his shit, but he does get it done)... at the same time he's got a bunch of Democrats and their media empire to contend with.

He's currently riding a high in the approval polls, which means he has political capital.  But what should he spend it on?  He could totally blast the wall funding through, and hope he gets it done before his political capital is empty.

The Democrats NEED to #resist, they HAVE to, and they NEED Trump to do something #resist worthy, ESPECIALLY after the SOTU.  They look really bad right now, and he's looking pretty good.

It's... complex.  It's why Trump is in that chair instead of Hillary or Ted Cruz.  He knows how to spin an IMAGE.  He can plot the course of the media with a single tweet.  He takes pressers every time he goes to step on an airplane, taking questions off the cuff.  He spins in real time, without tons of think tanks or sentiment analysis.  It's his superpower.

At the same time, though, he really does believe that these waves of illegal migrants are a danger to this country.  No matter how many terrorists, drug lords, gang members, or tons of drugs they find at the border, it's not enough for the other side to put in barriers to entry.  They're going out of their way to make the border LESS safe.  Now they're demanding fewer beds in detention centers in order to cause overflow in order to release these people into the country.

THEY WANT ILLEGAL MIGRATION AND THEY'LL THROW ANYONE UNDER THE BUS FOR IT.

So Trump is between a rock and a rock.  On the one hand, he needs to time things for maximum media impact, because the media spin machines work 24 hours a day to make him look bad.  On the other hand, these are real problems with real people who get really hurt, and postponing something a day might mean somebody is dead, trafficked, raped, hooked on a drug, killed by fetanyl, or something else.

At the end of the day, I trust him to find the balance.  The first shutdown was a black eye.  He made the collossal mistake of saying he'd take the responsiblity, and let the Democrats run to town with it.  Now he's got a second chance to make a message to the American people.

&amp;#x200B;

...and I think it's possible that when he does get his barrier after all this shit, the anti-borders crowd will look at a landscape of people frustrated by the nonsense, spun by the Trump Media Superpower, under courts which are starting to not be left-leaning rubber stamps, topped by a supreme court which leans conservative for the first time in decades...

&amp;#x200B;

...and they'll have to decide if it's worth actually fighting this fight again, in public, having to stand up for illegal migrants against American citizens.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  As a Republican, I wish he'd just get it over with and get it into the courts.  But there's a lot more going on than just a wall;  there's a thousand whirling sprockets, with media (owned by like 6 people at the top) and politicians cooperating to make him look bad, and a court system which is still pretty anti-Trump.  But every day ticking by gives him a chance to spin it, get more court coverage (the Senate is cranking the judge mill, filling in hundreds of judges on federal courts that the Obama and Bush administrations left open).  Every caravan that makes a run to the border makes his point.",1

Well an opioid is a narcotic pain medication that derived from the poppy plant or man made (semi synthetic), like codeine, oxycotin, herion, morphine and of course fentanyl. The problem is that fentanyl is roughly 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times stronger than herion. A opioid naive ( person who is not already on any opiods and has no tolerance) aka you and your friend, would have overdosed so rapidly ( especially since you smoked it) that you would of had no time and would be so sedated that 1. You would not of really had that much time to have had the said conversation and 2. Your friend who you said had fentanyl in his system would of never been able to walk, run, whatever the said distance was. He would of been in respiratory distress with in 1 to 3 mins after inhaling and would lose consciousness with in 5 at most. So all in all i think you are a liar.

And before you say well maybe it was not that much he smoked, fentanyl is dosed in micrograms. MICROGRAMS. A few grains of salt worth is all that was needed.


And also you could say maybe it wasn't fentanyl, maybe it was another opioid like herion. NOPE. As stated fentanyl is man made ( full synthetic) so it will not show up on a test for morphine/herion or codeine/oxycotin. It needs to be tested separately.",1

So lets say you travel to bangkok then you can just look up bangkok and know that diaz and xans are OTC there(Xany may have been banned so I need to research that again) but it would be a great thing. For example you are a H addict and cant find any then you know you can get yout comfort meds easily in every pharmacy. Wouldnt that be great? But thats just my opinion. Or if you travel to eastern european countrys like Serbia then you would know that many benzos are OTC and also I have read that 95% of the pharmacist can be bribed  So you know that you have a chance of 95% to get the veneric Sandoz 80mg oxy which are sold all over the world. Just received 1 of the blisters lagely cause my order got lost and they put instead of 15 1mg Galenika Alprazolam 30 in there plus 1 blister of the 80mg oxycodon hydrochlorid instabt release from Sandoz also for free in there and I know why cause the 128 pcs of the 80mg Sandoz oxy only costs in serbia 20€.  
And they only cost so much if you get them from the pharmacy. The Galenika Diazepam and Alpeazolam always have a blister of 15 pills not like normally 10 pills.And all the packages that get ""hurt"" while packaging and cant be sold get thrown away and the workers there can easily pick them up in cartons of thousands of them and take them home and no one cares. And its the same at Sandoz, dont know 100% if its Sandoz who produces the 80mg in Serbia but a eastern european company also prpduces Oxy 5,7.5,10,20,30,40,80,120mg there too and if a pack gets hurt they just throw them in cartons and then at the end of tgeit shift they should throw them away but no one takes a second look if they really throw they away. Told that story here before a few times but back 3 years I had a serbian friend which uncles worked for Galenika and the Oxy,morphine ect (mainly pain pills) company and he drove regulary to them with his company car and brought in thousands of pills and a brick or maybe two of H #3 and about 100g of H #4. I helped him pack that shit and didnt had to get any H for a month and no benzos for 2 month. Once nearly bevore he ended this thing he got really paranoid and only trust me cause I alwaYs helped him out etc. when all his stuff was gone. So be came back with ahuge loading and we had to pack everytging in 2 day which means wirking 20hours min. After 21 we were done and everything was delivered too. Whuch I normally didnt do but the offer was too good. I received 50g of uncut #3 15g of ubcut #4 120x120mg oxy. And the resg in blisters of oxy: 25x80, 20x40, 50x30 and 30x20, 100x5mg. Which is a heavy amount plus 2000mg of Alprazolam and 200 box s of the rare 25mg Diazepam (Failure of the press machine should be 20m) 1 box contained 120 blister. This was the night of the nights.

Eu...  ""às vezes"" concordo com você. Mas essa rebelião/revolta/revolução não pode ter como base nós redditors, teria que ter como base o povo que mora nas favelas, os rurais, as pessoas em empregos informais... esses são a grande massa de injustiçados que mal sabem o quanto o Estado lhes deve de Direito e dinheiro e dá indevidamente para o bolso de quem não merece.

Ok, concordamos nisso.


Por outro lado, eu ainda estou numa fase de não perder a fé no sistema. Não acho que a justiça brasileira funcione de forma eficaz. E não acho que viverei pra ver uma justiça que funcione devidamente nesse país. Agora, lembre-se que muitos países bons da Europa passaram por séculos e séculos de lutas de classe pra atingirem o patamar que estão. Banhos de sangue. Décadas de vidas de pessoas inteligentes e humanas se debruçando sobre questões sociais para mudar 0,001% do sistema durante seu breve tempo de vida.


O sistema social muda de forma muito devagar. Em uma analogia pobre, são tipos as transformações na natureza, elas acontecem, mas não se nota o ""turning point"". Eu prefiro confiar que estamos lentamente caminhando pra um país melhor.


Contudo, se você quer acelerar o processo, acho que só uma rebelião/revolução mesmo. Mas tem que ter a aderência da massa pobre e ignorante desse país. Tarefa hérculea, mas se alguém conseguisse isso, seria meu heroi, e não estou brincando.",1

Smartphones und Computer spielen für die frühkindliche Entwicklung wohl keine Rolle. Wie sollen Kinder unter 3-6 Jahren beides richtig bedienen können?

Bei so kleinen Kindern sind es wohl eher die Eltern, die - wie beim Fernsehen auch - die Benutzung fördern weil es dazu führt, dass das Kind nicht stört.

Besser wäre wohl das Kind (auch damit es alle möglichen Erfahrungen sammelt) immer dabei zu haben und alles mit dem Kind zu machen aber ob das immer realistisch ist möchte ich bezweifeln.

Je mehr man mit dem Kind unternimmt, desto besser ist es für das Kind. Das ändert sich aber in keinem Alter.

&gt; Das Smartphone muss nicht an für sich schädlich sein, sondern es ist wichtig, dass das Kind noch viel Zeit mit anderen Dingen verbringt.

&gt; Das Smartphone muss nicht an für sich schädlich sein, sondern es ist wichtig, dass das Kind noch viel Zeit mit anderen Dingen verbringt.

Genau wie 24/7 Fernsehen zu gucken ist 24/7 am Smartphone zu hängen kein guter Plan. Spoiler: Es gibt keine Aktivität die 24/7 eine gute Idee ist, denn es bleibt immer etwas anderes auf der Strecke.

&gt; Hier geht es vor allem um die Bildung von Oxycotin.

Jaja, ich zitiere deinen Beitrag: ""Das richtet ganz viel im Gehirn aus."". Ungenauer geht's wohl kaum.

Wundert mich auch nicht, die meisten Gehirnfunktionen sind kaum verstanden, trotzdem werden die gerne mal als Argument reingeschleudert.

&gt; Das Hormon wird in realen zwischenmenschlichen Kontakten ausgeschüttet, nicht aber bei Computerspielen. Zocken im realen Umfeld hingegen ist okay, z.B. Mario Kart auf der Game Cube.

[[citation needed](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

&gt; Je mehr jemand einen Bildschirm nutzt als Jugendlicher, desto weniger Empathie hat er für Ältere und Freunde.

Das jeder vierte Jugendliche gestresst ist liegt wohl weniger am Smartphone als an den gewachsenen Erwartungen die von der Gesellschaft an ihn gestellt werden. Das selbe zeigen regelmäßig Studien über das Schulsystem, siehe späte Hausaufgaben die oft überfordern etc.

Genau die selben Vorbehalte hat es gegenüber dem Computer in den Generationen davor gegeben und bisher ist die Apokalypse ausgeblieben. Ich erinnere mich noch an die Debatten über z.B. Counter-Strike das die Kinder schon damals verdorben hat, oder auch nicht.

Speziell das bei den jugendlichen in deinem Beitrag angesprochene Verhalten mit der Technologie (""Wenn ich lerne mach ichs aus oder auf lautlos, denn wenn ich lerne dann richtig."") ist ein wichtiger Teil der Bildung für die Zukunft. Speziell jugendliche in eine Hülle ohne Technologie zu hüllen bis die Schule vorbei ist und sie dann eiskalt in eine Welt zu kicken in der Smartphones allgegenwärtig sind und bspw. ich, im Job, oft besorgt angerufen werde wenn ich eine E-Mail nicht innerhalb einer Stunde beantworte finde ich brutal und sinnlos.

Seine Zeit einzuteilen und prioritäten zu setzen ist eine Fähigkeit die in Zukunft immer wichtiger werden wird. (Zum Beispiel um auf Reddit zu diskutieren)

&gt; Smartphones sind schlimmer als Asbest.

Hahahaha

&gt; Alle Kinder haben eine Schlafstörung

Allerdings und zwar dadurch bedingt, dass wir sie entgegen ihres natürlichen Rhytmus zwingen um &lt;7 Uhr morgens aufzustehen und ab 8 erwarten, dass sie möglichst konzentriert arbeiten können. Das liegt aber nicht an Smartphones.

&gt; Die Quittung werden wir kriegen, die schulischen Leistungen gehen ja jetzt schon runter.

Ja, in den skandinavischen Ländern zwar nicht aber da gibt's halt auch keine Spielekonsolen und Smartphones, nicht wahr? Alle anderen Gründe wären eventuell unbequem, ich denke es werden einfach diese scheiß Spiele sein. Wie bei Amokläufen.

&gt; Im Waldorfkindergarten gibt es ein Verbot für alle neuen Medien.

Da zeigt sich doch deutlich worum es geht, nicht um die Schädlichkeit sondern einzig um die Angst vor neuem, sonst wäre das Verbot ja spezifisch (oder ist das etwa schon die ganze Spezifikation?)

&gt; Studien hinterlegen obige Argumente und Psychologen unterstützen einen verminderten Konsum von elektronischen Medien bei Kindern und Jugendlichen.

Ja, von diesen Studien habe ich viel gehört. Sind die denn auch aussagekräftig? Viele dieser psychologischen Studien sind schlecht angefertigt, eine Menge davon niemals wiederholt worden. (wer würde auch bezahlen etwas zu erforschen für das es schon eine heilige Studie gibt) 

&gt; Für Kinder sollten beide Themen Tabu sein, während sie für erwachsene Menschen unschädlich sind.

Das kann schon nicht sein weil der Übergang zwischen Jugendlichen und Erwachsenen fließend ist. Das widerspricht einer klaren Trennung.",1

**Introductions**  
&amp;nbsp;  




Slave of Yah – “briefest of Old Testament prophetic books…  
&amp;nbsp;  




“Who was this prophet? – where born? – of what country? – at what time did he prophesy? – who were his parents? – when, and where did he die? – are questions which have been asked from the remotest antiquity; and which, to his day, have received no answer worthy of recording…  
&amp;nbsp;  




“Whoever will be at the trouble to collate this short prophecy with the forty-ninth chapter of Jeremiah, will find a remarkable similarity, not only in the sentiments and words, but also in whole verses….  Whether he copied Obadiah, or Obadiah him, cannot be determined: but it would be very strange if two prophets, unacquainted with each other, should speak of the same event precisely in the same terms.” (Adam Clarke, The Holy Bible containing the Old and New Testament... with Commentary and Critical Notes, 1831, p. IV 425)  
&amp;nbsp;  




“The political situation implied in the prophecy points to a time after the Exile, probably in the mid-fifth century B.C. …  
&amp;nbsp;  




“The occasion of the prophecy is the expulsion of the Edomites from their land, which the prophet sees as a divine judgment on that nation for its cruelties toward Israel.  
&amp;nbsp;  




“The first main division (vss. [verses] 1-14) deals with Edom’s judgment and the moral reasons therefore.  An alliance of surrounding nations is being roused to wage war on Edom (vs. [verse]1*b*).  God’s purpose is to humble the Edomites’ pride and to rout them out from their supposedly impregnable mountain fortresses (vss. 2-4)…  
&amp;nbsp;  




“The second main section (vss. 15-21 concerns the day of the Lord, which includes universal judgment, the restoration of Israel, and the establishment of the kingdom of God… Deliverers will arise to lead Israel to victory over Edom (vs. 21*a*).  Thus the kingdom of God will be established (vs. 21*b*)…  
&amp;nbsp;  




“The close verbal parallels between vss. 1-9 and Jer. [Jeremiah] 49:7-22 can be explained only by some literary relationship between the two passages… The difference in the order of the material makes it likely that both Obadiah and Jeremiah are using an earlier oracle against Edom…  
&amp;nbsp;  




“Several phrases are also common to Obadiah and Joel… In 2:32 Joel indicates that he is quoting directly from Obad. ‎[Obadiah] ‎17 by the phrase, ‘as the Lord has said.’…  
&amp;nbsp;  




“The text of Obadiah is moderately well preserved.  Since vss. 7, 19, 21 are difficult to interpret as they now stand, they may have suffered corruption in transmission.” (Thompson, 1953, pp. VI 857-859)  
&amp;nbsp;  






**Text and Exegeses**  
&amp;nbsp; 






“1. Vision [of] `oBaD-YaH [“Slave of YHVH”, Obadiah]:  
&amp;nbsp; 




‘Thus said my Lords YHVH to ’eDOM [“red” Edom]  


a hearing we heard from YHVH,  


and an envoy in nations was sent forth;  


rise and we will rise upon her to war:  
&amp;nbsp;




-2. “Behold, little I gave you among nations,  


contemptible you are very.  
&amp;nbsp; 




-3. Malignity [of] your heart beguiled you,  


dwellers in clefts of **rock**.  


High [מרום, *MehROM*] is his settlement;  


he says in his heart,  


‘Who will lower [יורדני, *YoReeDayNiY*], me to land?’   
&amp;nbsp;  







[Figure 1 Petra, the Edomite capital](https://www.reddit.com/r/biblestudy/comments/aolu0j/illustration_for_obadiah_13/?)  
&amp;nbsp;  




-4. If you elevate [תגביה, *TahGBiYHa*] like an eagle,  


and if between stars is your nest,   


from there I will lower you.”  


saith YHVH.’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“The Edomites lived in ‘retreats of rock’ (Song of S. [Solomon] 2:14), hiding places in canyons and caves.  The translation **rock** interprets *ṣela’* as a common noun, alluding to the rugged terrain of the whole region.  There is probably also a secondary reference to **Sela**… the modern Umm el-Bayyârah, the rock citadel of the ancient inhabitants of Teman… and of Petra…  apt poetic impressions of the crags, fantastic in shape and color, … ‘A rose-red city – half as old as Time’ (J. W. Burgon…).”  (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 861)  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“Edom …was located in the highlands on the E [east] side of the Dead Sea.  The reddish (Hebr [Hebrew] *’ĕdôm*, ‘Edom’; *’ādom*, ‘red’) mountains of Edom, rising higher than 3,280 ft., provided significant military security for the Edomites.  The capital of Edom was Sela (Judg [Judges] 1:36; etc.), a name which means ‘rock’ and which provides a nice instance of paronomasia^1 (the ‘rock’ is both the mountains of Edom and its capital), and of synecdoche^2 (the part, Sela, is used for the whole, Edom).” (Mallon, 1990, p. 404)  
&amp;nbsp;  




…  


“7. ‘“Unto the border they sent you forth,  


all [the] men of your covenant beguiled you,  


prevailed [יכלו, *YaKhLOo*] to you, [the] men of your peace,  


[those who broke] your bread [with you] have placed a wound beneath you;  


there is no understanding in him.”’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“Under Arab pressure in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. the Edomites were finally driven completely out of their original borders and settled in southern Judah… The Arab conquerors had formerly been Edom’s allies in raids on Judah (Ps. [Psalm] 83:6).” (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 862)  
&amp;nbsp;  



…  


“10. ‘“From violence [against] your brother Ya-`aQOB [“YHVH Followed”, Jacob] you are covered in  shame, and are cut off to world.”’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“This doom was ultimately fulfilled when the Idumeans (the Grecianized name for this people) were conquered by the Jews under John Hyrcanus (134-104 B.C.) and ceased to have a separate national existence (Josephus *Antiquities* XIII. 9. 1).” (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 863)  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;However, Herod the Great was an Idumean; his dynasty was created and exterminated by the Romans.  
&amp;nbsp;  




“11. ‘“In a day you stood from against,  


in a day captured, strangers, his forces,  


and foreigners came [to] his gates  


and upon Jerusalem handed lots;  


also you are as one of them.”’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“According to I Esdras 4:45, the Edomites took an active part with the Chaldeans in the invasion and plundering of Judah, which reached its climax in the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 B.C.  The spoil was divided by lot (as in Joel 3:3).” (Thompson, 1953, pp. VI 863-864)  
&amp;nbsp;  




“12. ‘“And do not see in a day [of] your brother, in a day [of] his estrangement,  


and do not be happy to sons of YeHOo-DaH [“YHVH knows”, Judah], in a day [of] their destruction,  


and do not greaten your mouth in a day [of] distress…  


…  


-15. For near is Day [of] YHVH upon all the nations,  


as that you did I will do to you;  


your recompense will redound [ישוב, *YaShOoB*] in your head.  


-16. For as you drank upon my holy mountain,  


will drink all the nations always,  


and drink and swallow,  


and be as if they had never been.”’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“The imagery of drinking the cup of God’s wrath is most fully developed in Jer. 25: 15-28, where the figure is explained as God’s judgment, first on Judah and then on the pagans.” (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 865)  
&amp;nbsp;



“17. ‘And in Mount Zion there will be a refugee,  


and he will be holy,  


and will inherit, House Ya-`aQOB, their inheritance.  
&amp;nbsp;  




-18. And will be, House Ya-`aQOB, fire,  


and House YOÇayPh [“Increase”, Joseph] flame,  


and House `aySaV [“Ruddy”, Esau] straw,  


and they will ignite in them and consume them,  


and there will not be a remnant to House `aySaV,  


for YHVH words.’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“After their return from captivity the Jews… did break out as a flame upon the Idumeans: they reduced them into slavery; and obliged them to receive circumcision, and practice the rites of the Jewish religion.  See I Macc. [Maccabees] v, 3, &amp;C… and Joseph. [Josephus] Antiq. lib. xiii, c. 17.” (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. IV 427)  
&amp;nbsp;  





“19. ‘And they will inherit the Negev^3 , the Mountain [of] `aySaV,  


and the ShPhayLaH^4 .  


The [את, *’eTh*] Philistines: and they will inherit the field [of] ’ePhRaYiM [“Fruitful”, Ephraim] and the field [of] ShoMRON [“Guarded”, Samaria],  


and BiN-YaMiN [“Son of Right (or South)” Benjamin] the GiL`ahD [“Mound of Testimony”, Gilead].  
&amp;nbsp;  




-20. And exile [of] this force to sons of YiSRa-‘ayL [“Strove [with] God”,  Israel], who are Canaanites until TsaRPhaTh [15 miles south of Sidon],  


and exile of Jerusalem which is in **ÇPhaRahD** [Sardis],    



and they will inherit the cites of the Negev.’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“The directions in which the expansion would take place are thus south, west, north, and east.  These conquests were accomplished in the second century B.C., when northern Judah and Benjamin were the nucleus from which the Jews under the Maccabees pressed out into the areas indicated in this verse…  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“**Sepharad** is Sardis, *Çparad* in Persian monuments, the capital of Lydia in Asia Minor.  An Aramaic inscription with a parallel Lydian text, found at Sardis, calls this city *ṣprd*, the same consonants as here, and proves the existence of a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth year of Artaxerxes, probably Artaxerxes I Longimanus, king of Persia (465-424 B.C…).  The Peshitta^5 and Targ. [Targum^6] misinterpreted this name as Spain, and consequently Spanish and Portuguese Jews are called Sephardim.” (Thompson, 1953, pp. VI 866-867)  
&amp;nbsp;



“21. ‘And will ascend saviors in Mount Zion to judge the Mountain [of] `aySaV,  
&amp;nbsp;



and the kingdom will be to YHVH.’”  
&amp;nbsp;



&gt;“These reconquests will be led by saviors who, like the judges of old (Judg. 2:16; 3:9, 15) will deliver the Israelites from their oppressors.” (Thompson, 1953, p. VI 867)

Most ODs are either the result of relapsing and doing your old dose when your tolerance has lowered or using more than you intend due to stronger than average heroin. That doesn't even take into account the fact that addicts wouldn't be unknowingly shooting up fentenyl when they think it's heroin. And lately, that's been the real killer.

Selling drugs isn't bad. Pharmacies are sell drugs. Pharmacies sell lots of drugs that can kill you too but people are informed and take it safely. There are safe amounts coke you can take and not die.


&gt;People overdosed from taking too much long before fentanyl. Often has to do with when they fall off the wagon after a period of being clean, they pick up where they left off in terms of dose and it’s too much for their system. As a lot of addicts say “I know I have one more high in me, I don’t know if I have one more recovery”.

I disagree. People are not taking fentanyl. It is a legal drug. The reason you hear about fantanyl is because it is cut into coke and other drugs to increase the amount available to be sold. Another reason people OD is because there isn't a safe supply. So they have to buy off multiple dealers which do not have any sort of quality control which leads to different amounts of drugs in each use.

&gt;Simply watching the much better lives of the rest of us who don’t do hard drugs is all the evidence you need.

How do they get to there from rock bottom?

&gt;   María Gabriela Chavez es la mujer más rica de Venezuela y su hermana ventila sus dólares; ""Nicolacito"" Maduro suma cargos para los que no está preparado. Sus primos, presos por narcotráfico. Foto: CedocVenezuela ha vivido en los últimos años [**un colapso económico marcado por la hiperinflación**](http://www.perfil.com/tags/crisis-en-venezuela) y la escasez de insumos de primera necesidad. Millones viven en la pobreza, mientras al menos 2,3 millones huyeron del país desde 2015, según la ONU, que considera este éxodo el mayor en la historia reciente de América Latina. Las multitudinarias protestas contra este sistema dejaron ya más de 40 muertos y unos 1.000 detenidos por las fuerzas armadas de Nicolás Maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; Alejados de esa terrible realidad, un grupo de hijos del poder venezolano gastan sus dólares para pagar sus vacaciones en los hoteles más lujosos del mundo. Entre estos “niños mimados” del chavismo se encuentra la hija mayor del líder de la revolución bolivariana, Hugo Chávez, **María Gabriela, quien se calcula que es la mujer más rica de Venezuela**. Tendría una fortuna personal de más de 4.000 millones de dólares escondida en cuentas bancarias de Europa.
&gt; 
&gt;  [María Gabriela Chávez](http://fotos.perfil.com//2019/02/05/900/0/maria-gabriela-chavez-639305.jpg)María Gabriela junto a la expresidenta Cristina Kirchner.
&gt; 
&gt; La mujer, de 38 años, ganó su gran fortuna mientras actuaba como primera dama de su padre socialista presidente, el ex teniente coronel Chávez, después de que se divorciara de su segunda esposa. El fallecido mandatario dijo que María Gabriela fue su “heroina” cuando pidió ayuda al líder cubano Fidel Castro tras el fallido intento de golpe de Estado de 2002 que pretendía deshacerse de su régimen socialista. Actualmente ocupa el cargo de embajadora alternativa de Venezuela ante las Naciones Unidas en Europa.
&gt; 
&gt; Sin embargo, Gabriela, y otros niños de la elite socialista de Venezuela, **parecen haber olvidado el lema de Chavez: “Ser rico es malo, es inhumano”**. Su hermana menor ""Rosines"" huyó del país avergonzada horas de publicar una foto con las manos llenas de billetes de dólares en las redes sociales en 2016. Mientras los maestros venezolanos prácticamente están trabajando gratis y las tasas universitarias están por los techos, Rosines vive en Europa, quizás disfrutando de sus dólares. Se calcula que Chávez dejó a sus hijos una fortuna de US$ 1.800 millones.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nicolacito, el Delfín**
&gt; 
&gt;  [Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra](http://fotos.perfil.com//2019/02/05/900/0/nicolas-ernesto-maduro-guerra-639304.jpg)""Nicolacito"" Maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; Por suerte para Maduro, su hijo **“Nicolacito” Maduro Guerra** mantiene un perfil mucho más bajo que los demás niños ricos del chavismo, y solamente se metió en problemas el día que amenazó a Donald Trump con apoderarse de la Casa Blanca si el ejército de los Estados Unidos invadía Venezuela. Dos años antes, el parlamentario había sido capturado en un video, en el lujoso Gran Hotel Meliá, bailando al ritmo de música árabe mientras le caía una lluvia de billetes de dólares.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sin experiencia laboral y con un currículum educativo conservado como secreto de Estado**, Nicolacito es miembro de la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente y su vida política es una suma de los favores paternos. De flautista en una orquesta nacional pasó a ocupar sucesivamente tres altos cargos públicos en la administración chavista -entre ellos, jefe del Cuerpo de Inspectores Especiales de la Presidencia de la República- desde 2014.
&gt; 
&gt; Tras aquel nombramiento, el joven de veinte años recorrió Venezuela para proclamar alabanzas a los mandatarios chavistas y críticas contra los opositores: ""El PSUV va a salvar a la humanidad"", predica el hijo presidencial. Posteriormente, fue nombrado director de la Escuela de Cine de Venezuela, una designación polémica. ""El hijo de Maduro no sabe nada del Séptimo Arte. De lo que sí sabe es de robar cámara"", opinó el dramaturgo venezolano José Tomás Angola. **""El colmo del desprecio y del cinismo"", resumió un colega**.
&gt; 
&gt; Nicolacito es fruto del primer matrimonio de Maduro. En 2013, el mandatario se casó con **Cilia Flores, apodada la “primera combatiente”** y que también forma parte de la Constituyente que busca, todavía infructuosamente, cambiar la Constitución. Flores es una abogada de 60 años que participó en la defensa de Chávez cuando estuvo preso en 1992. Bajo su tutela, la esposa de Maduro ocupó importantes cargos en el partido y en el Estado, incluida la presidencia del Parlamento.
&gt; 
&gt; El Tesoro de Estados Unidos **[introdujo en su “lista negra”](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/bloomberg/bc-eeuu-sanciona-a-esposa-de-presidente-venezolano-por-corrupcion.phtml) a la primera combatiente**, incluyéndola en una larga lista de hombres y mujeres del chavismo relacionados con actividades de corrupción y narcotráfico, violación de los derechos humanos o la sistemática destrucción de la democracia venezolana. Según informó, sus tres hijos estuvieron entre los grandes beneficiados de un esquema de corrupción que sustrajo hasta US$ 1.200 millones de PDVSA.

&gt; 
&gt; La familia de la primera dama también se “colgó” de los petrodólares venezolanos. **Efraín Antonio Campo Flores y Franqui Francisco Flores, sobrinos de Cilia**, fueron encarcelados en 2017 por 18 años cada uno después de haberlos capturado tratando de contrabandear $ 20 millones en cocaína a los EE.UU. a través de Haití. Al momento del arresto, según la periodista venezolana Maibort Petit, los chicos confesaron que el transporte de la droga era supervisado por Diosdado Cabello, uno de los pilares del chavismo, y Tareck El Aissami, vicepresidente de la Nación.
&gt; 
&gt; **Yoswal Gavidia Flores y Walter Gavidia Flores, hijos de la primera dama**, son considerados por Maduro como sus propios hijos. Los jóvenes gastar unos 45 mil dólares en una extravagante estadía de 18 noches en el hotel Ritz de París, donde las habitaciones cuestan 591 dólares la noche, el equivalente al salario mínimo mensual de 2.000 venezolanos. Los dos hijastros presidenciales también fueron vistos en restaurantes de lujo y tiendas de ropa y joyas de Madrid, mientras una de cada doce familias venezolanas se ve obligada a buscar comida en los contenedores de basura.
&gt; 
&gt; Según informó el diario español [_**La Razón**_](https://www.larazon.es/internacional/los-hijos-de-maduro-se-alojan-18-dias-en-el-ritz-en-plena-ola-de-represion-CK15687467) en un artículo titulado “Los hijos de Maduro se alojan 18 días en el Ritz en plena ola de represión”, Yoswal y Walter **gastaron en total unos US$ 46.000 en su estadía en el lujoso Ritz en Madrid**, además de sus visitas a los mejores restaurantes madrileños y tiendas de lujo, calificando sus hábitos como “un tren de vida al que están acostumbrados desde hace años los dos hermanos, que pasan muchos meses fuera de Venezuela y acostumbran viajar en vuelos privados”. Los gastos mínimos entre hotel, transporte y compras habrían superado los 40.000 euros.
&gt; 
&gt; La vida loca de Yoswal y Walter se terminó el año pasado cuando junto a su hermano Yosser fueron acusados por el senador estadounidense Marco Rubio de estar involucrados en un plan de lavado de dinero en septiembre de 2018. En la trama habrían transferido más de US$ 600 millones provenientes de PDVSA -la compañía petrolera estatal venezolana- a una compañía pantalla con sede en Hong Kong controlada por, como los calificó Rubio, “conspiradores venezolanos”. De acuerdo con el senador, **parte del dinero (185 millones de dólares) fue enviado a los tres hijastros de Nicolás Maduro**.
&gt; 
&gt; Daniella, hija de Diosdado Cabello y de la ministra de Turismo, Marleny Contreras, completa la lista de niños ricos del chavismo. La hija del revolucionario, involucrado en el extranjero en numerosos casos de lavado de activos y narcotráfico, se presenta ante Venezuela como **una “influencer” y derrocha glamour en sus posteos en Instagram**, donde comparte cariñosas fotos junto a su padre, románticas imágenes con su novio cantante y otras instantáneas de su trabajo como voluntaria, de su programa de radio y su carrera musical. En junio de 2018, las autoridades estadounidenses dijeron que confiscaron a la chica unos 800 millones de dólares.

Correct, but walls are not impenetrable. My locks and home, and windows and cameras are still my most effective line of defense. 

Is it your position that we need a border wall? That the security measures we have are not effective? 

I’ll concede that, yes,  *some* of the border does still need updating/repairs for barriers and maintenance. In fact I believe it was 2013/14(?) that $1.3B per year has been budgeted for doing exactly that and we’ve had contractors down there working on it since. I also agree that we should be spending a lot more money on technology and hiring CBP to patrol the border, as well as more immigration judges and immigration personnel to process immigrants, and create technology that we can use to track and monitor migrant workers and asylum seekers. I would be 100% for $5.8B for those kinds of measures. But a wall from one end of the border to the other doesn’t seem like a prudent way to spend $5.8B. 

For starters, a wall that size would cost exponentially more than $5.8B, and a wall must be constantly maintained and still patrolled- either electronically or with boots on the ground. Second, most of the unwalled territory is in some of the harshest, most desolate parts of the country that is extremely difficult to access with a vehicle, much less on foot. The rates of entry through those areas is so small that I’m not sure there’s even accurate data for it. The land along the border is also privately owned. In my view, ifthose land owners want to fence their own property, they’re more than free to do so. I’m not asking the Federal government to come to my house and fence my property to keep bad guys out, why would we presume to tell American landowners that their own land isn’t there’s to protect? I know that eminent domain can be a useful and valuable tool, but it should be used sparingly and judiciously. Lastly, I don’t trust anything that has Trump’s name on it or comes from one of his ideas. His track record has shown over and over that he cannot be trusted so it’s hard for me to believe that he doesn’t have ulterior motives with this project. It’s so ill conceived and just not practical. It doesn’t pass the smell test, so to speak. 

I’m not trying to be antagonist and I don’t want to fight with you. But I *do* want to try to understand your position and why you might think that a border wall would be the grand fix it is claimed to be. Just this week the largest fentenyl bust in the us was made at a legal POE using the technology most Americans, and the Democrats support. CBP agents also discovered an extensive tunnel by doing on-the-ground reconnaissance. Walls don’t stop tunnels, and they don’t stop boats or airplanes or drones or trucks traveling through POE. I’m just confused about why “the wall” seems to be the only answer for some. Is this a discussion you’d be willing to engage with me on? Like I said, I don’t want to fight, I want to understand this point of view. ",1

La policía de fronteras de Turquía se incautó en el puerto de Mersin, al sureste del país, de unos 615 kilos de cocaína que llegaron a bordo de un barco procedente de Ecuador, informa este miércoles 6 de febrero del 2019 la prensa local.

El diario Haberturk asegura en su versión electrónica que se trata de la segunda incautación más importante de cocaína en el país eurasiático, con un valor estimados de casi USD 40 millones.La incautación más grande hasta ahora se produjo en septiembre de 2018, cuando las autoridades interceptaron 800 kilos de cocaína en Kocaeli, cerca de Estambul, en un buque procedente de Sudamérica.La cocaína encontrada en Mersin estaba escondida en contenedores de bananos entre unas 500 cajas con esas frutas.Según la policía local, cuatro personas fueron detenidas en relación con el hallazgo, aunque no se han informado sobre la nacionalidad de los arrestados.

Your last spray hit a lot of air, left arm three times, and although it was close to head I don't think you hit that.

1) clean needles decrease the infection rates of HIV... Sharing needles (and other forms of blood to blood contact) has the highest rate of transmission for HIV and thus by providing clean needles (which by the way... Are not expensive at all... Like I don't live in the states so I don't have the stupidly high markup price but I can buy 20 1cc syrunges for around $8 and that's after the store does its markup. Now decreasing the spread of HIV is great because this also means that anyone they have unprotected sex with is less likely to get infected (0% chance is less than the 1% chance) and it also prevents needles from lying around on the ground in the grass for people and kids to step on.

2) overdose prevention. Regardless of whether or not you have public health care, overdoses cost a lot to tax payers. By preventing overdoses you effectively save a ton of money.


Third and finally, many safe injection sites have resources set up for those that want to work towards getting clean... This includes tapering where they will slowly decrease your dose overtime in order to help you kick the addiction (which is one of the best ways to get clean). You also have to take into account that many people with opioid addictions start their addictions on prescription medications, like they might get into a car accident and get prescribed a painkiller like morphine while in the hospital and codeine while at home... But once their prescription runs out they are done cold turkey... Except that opioids have opium in them which can actually cause someone to die if they try to go cold turkey with a physical deoendancy. The solution to get past this is tapering the dose.... Unfortanely for a really long time we didn't know that (and even now many doctors don't taper doses near the end) and as a result many people would come off of their prescriptions and when searching to stop the pain and the withdrawal symptoms they turn to the opioid that is common on the streets... Heroin (which is really similar to morphine... In fact it's more accurate name is dimorphine)

Alien 1 e 2 funcionam por que é uma relação predador/presa representado pela Sigourney Weaver que é quase insubstituível.

Alien, Predador ou outros filmes de terror parecidos são extensões do labirinto do minotauro, onde você tem um bravo ""herói"" humano lutando pela sobrevivência, com um inimigo fisicamente superior, ou seja um predador dos homens.

Por isso personagens femininos do tipo ""bad-ass"" funcionam tão bem. Por que reforçam essa coisa de Davi vs. Golias.

Usei o exemplo do labirinto do Minotauro, por que o labirinto também é importante. No alien 1 e 2 o predador se esconde pelas espaço-naves e é um predador muito inteligente, com a possibilidade de vencer a inteligência humana (detalhe importante para um predador de humanos).

Essa coisa da claustrofobia portanto e do elemento de suspense e surpresa é muito importante. Outro elemento importante que é repetido no Predador, é que devem existir vários oponentes humanos até mais preparados que o 'Davi', mas que vão sendo eliminados até que o Davi não tenha outra opção a não ser lutar pela sua sobrevivência.

No Covenant portanto o Ridley Scott pecou na personagem forte feminina, que deveria ter continuado de qualquer jeito com a Noomi Rapace que matou a pau com um personagem com essas caracteristicas em Millenium, além de focar mais nessa situação de antagonismo entre heroi vs predador em um labirinto.

Focou demais no Dave, e também achei estranho os ""Engenheiros"" ainda existirem, e existindo, estarem no mesmo ponto evolutivo que estavam a milhares de anos atras.

Eles ou estariam muito evoluidos (do tipo construindo aquelas super-estruturas espaciais pra sequestrar estrelas) ou completamente extintos (o que facilitaria mais o plot.. poderia até usar pra dar uma lição de moral sobre condições climáticas como os EUA gostam de fazer desde os filmes de gangsters dos anos 30)",1

&gt;  Oxycontin is a medicine. It can be used a recreational drug and it has such deleterious side effects that it has caused a drug epidemic.

This is a flat-out lie I'm afraid. You've been reading literal fake news.

While it *is* possible to use it as a recreational drug, it's actually not very popular as such, especially not since they've cracked down on the diversion of drugs to addicts. Indeed, far more people abuse things like fetanyl and heroin. And most of the people who abuse prescription opiates acquire them illicitly.

Contrary to the lies you've read in the media, it turns out that, in real life, prescription opiates are *not* very addictive. They've done studies on this. Even *long-term* usage of opiate drugs for chronic pain has an extremely low addiction rate. Lemme quote:

&gt; [Within this grouping for those studies that had preselected CPPs for COAT exposure for no previous or current history of abuse/addiction, the percentage of abuse/addiction was calculated at 0.19%. For the ADRB grouping, there were 17 studies with 2,466 CPPs exposed and a calculated ADRB rate of 11.5%.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489635)

People without a history of abusing drugs almost never started abusing drugs after using prescription opiates even for *long-term pain*.

Meanwhile, 1 in 9 people who had a history of abusing drugs abused them if they were given access to them.

Opiates aren't the problem; drug addicts are the problem. Drug addicts do abuse opiates, but if you're not an addict, you're not really in danger of becoming one if you're prescribed opiates for pain.

As it turns out, the whole idea that the pharmaceutical industry made a bunch of addicts is a flat-out lie.

Indeed, the abuse of prescription painkillers was mostly done by people who didn't even have valid prescriptions for it, and it got heavily cracked down on.

The real problem is - and always has been - heroin (and various other similar drugs, like fetanyl). They're vastly more dangerous and also give a much better high.

As it turns out, though, ""drug addicts abuse prescription drugs as well when they can"" isn't exactly news. And drug addicts, being irresponsible assholes, want to blame everyone but themselves for their problems.

The fact is that pharma companies weren't making normal people addicts, they were just turning a blind eye towards diversion of prescription drugs to people who abuse drugs. While that's a shitty thing for them to be doing, it was frankly probably better than the alternative - since we've cracked down on it, the addicts have turned back to using more dangerous drugs, though they likely would have done so anyway because, again, better high.

Prescription opiates aren't actually very dangerous drugs when used medically; the biggest problem with them is the fact that you become tolerant to their effects over time. This is actually the main reason why they're not ideal for long-term pain treatment - not because they're addictive, but because they stop being as effective if you use them for a very long time. They're great for things like post-surgical pain.

&gt; Chemotherapy destroys a patient's body and hopefully does more to the cancer than the rest of the body. You probably don't have any issue with those medicines (or any other of a large number that would fall afoul of your logical process).

We don't use heroin medically because it is more dangerous than the drugs we do use. You *can* use heroin as a painkiller and as a sedative (and in fact, they did historically), but it is unacceptably risky compared to safer alternatives these days.

Indeed, that is frequently how drugs work - if you have two drugs, and one of them is much more dangerous than the other, they'll use the less dangerous drug. A big part of modern medical advancement has been drugs with fewer negative side effects.

Of course, some drugs do have rather large negative side effects, and those only get approved if the thing that the drug is treating is worse than the side effects overall. Chemotherapy sucks, but the alternative is death, so the fact that it has really bad side effects is acceptable because the alternative is dying.

And indeed, when you make a new drug, you have to compare it to the older drugs that exist. One of the main reasons why many more drugs fail trials these days is not that they don't work, but that they have worse side effects than the drugs which already exist, or are less efficacious than the drugs that already exist. If you want a new drug approved, it has to beat the drugs that already exist; they won't approve a drug that lowers your blood pressure if it kills 1 in 100 people if the existing drug only kills 1 in 100,000 people.

But the reality is that absolutely no one with even the most basic understanding of medicine would ever say that smoking marijuana was ""medicine"" because you don't fucking do that. The doses of medicines are carefully calculated and tabulated to ensure that they achieve what is known as a theraputic dose. We don't chew on willow bark to treat pain - we give people aspirin tablets.

There are some chemical compounds in cannabis which are useful medically, if refined and purified and administered. Moreover, when this is done, they work a lot better *and* don't have the side effects, *as these substances don't make you high.*

These cannabinoids are interesting medically. But smoking pot is not medicine - the dosage is uncontrolled and you're taking a bunch of random substances together for no reason.

Potheads, like alcoholics, sometimes claim that their drug of choice is medicine for them. But it isn't. It's an addiction. You can drink alcohol to mitigate pain, but only a quack would suggest becoming an alcoholic because your back hurts.

The reality is that ""medical marijuana"" is bullshit, scientifically speaking. It's just an excuse for people to get high and an attempt to legalize weed. It's no different from patent medicine. You know, [like heroin.](https://static.businessinsider.com/image/4ec52974eab8ea002b000009-750.jpg)",1

Fora isso, estás a entrar na escala de casos de dor excecionais de categoria intensa, onde geralmente a primeira linha de prescrição é codeína que já é opióide, mas bem fraquinho dentro da classe deles, não comparável é a heroína sintetizada como o OxyCotin. Se tal falhar, escala-se para um analgésico opióide mais forte.

Nos EUA, a primeira linha de ação é muito frequentemente prescrever-se logo um analgésico opiáceo médio como Percocet/Vicodin para remoção de dentes. Pelo contrário em PT, isso só escala em casos bem problemáticos e quando são esgotadas todas as terapias. 

A abordagem de gestão de dor é completamente diferente em PT e nos EUA. Em PT, as diretrizes médicas são no sentido de tornar a dor suportável para o doente, é esse o critério. Nos EUA, procura-se eliminar qualquer tipo de desconforto para o paciente e a dor não é encarada como algo natural no processo, daí a prescrição acessível de opiáceos.

Se falares com médicos e lhes perguntares a que tipo de pessoas tipicamente passam analgésicos opióides, dizem-te coisas como pacientes oncológicos, terminais e casos excecionais. Nesse sentido, acho que até tocas num assunto interessante no teu ponto original, mas tens de saber diferenciar que não moras nos EUA, apesar de sermos muito permeáveis às notícias deles, no nosso País não se aplica. Segundo as estatísticas, estás num dos países europeus com menor prescrição de opiáceos. Era o mesmo que se eu me viesse queixar que toda a gente acaba falida quando vai às urgências em Portugal por falta de seguro médico, quando isso é um problema americano, percebes o meu ponto de vista?

Diazepam, Alprazolam, etc. são benzodiazepinas, é uma categoria de medicamento totalmente diferente! Eles não são prescritos para efeitos analgésicos, nem têm nada a ver a nível de farmacologia. Não podes dizer coisas como ""substitutos de opiáceos"", isso é o mesmo que dizer que o Pepe foi contratado para substituir o Aboubakar quando jogam em posições diferentes.",1

The fantasies stuck with me. I grew into a ""normal"" hetero guy, became a very masculine biker, but I would dress up in private and fantasize that I was a girl, and tied up at the mercy of a Mistress or Master. I found stories online about men being forced to be women either by an outside force or by a ""voice in the head"", and becoming female sex slaves, and imagined myself in that position. They were just fantasies and I would have never wanted them to be true, it was a horrifying thought. About 10 years ago, I had a psychotic break that was brought on by prescription drugs, namely ambien, ocycontin and alcohol. I was hospitalized and the ambien and oxy removed, and I started to get better immediately. But something weird happened, and the same fantasies I had turned into an obsession, almost as if the obsession took on a life of its own and started to control me. I went to a psychiatrist, not to find out what was up, but convinced her that I was transgender so I could get hormones. I thought I would stop there, but the obsession grew stronger, and since then have had 7 surgeries, including facial feminization and gender reassignment last May. And the hetero guy is still inside, not happy, but compelled to live out what were just fantasies. I have recently placed ads on Craigslist for riggers and sought out dominant men on Fetlife, and am just now meeting people to help fulfill this destiny. I know this sounds like a made up story, and I don't care who believes it, but I am living it. Did my childhood experience have anything to do with setting me on this path?

Addicts use drugs because they either beleive or the drug actually does solve a problem they have temporarily. Can you agree thats true for at least a majority of addicts? 
Take the opioid epidemic for example. People prescribed opioids take them to fix their pain problem temporarily, then often turn to herion if theyre cut off, not because they think ""you know what sounds fun? Herioin""
 the other portion of opioid addicts self medicate as opioids are an amazing antidepressant, antiphychotic, and anti anxiety drugs. They may start as recriational, but continue taking them because they feel it makes thier life better in the begining. If somethings perfect, it cant get better, right? So if something makes life better there is a problem, even if its just being bored.

Can you agree with that? Im not saying drugs are inhearently bad, im saying addicts use because it makes something for them better.

Most addicts problem is beleiving drugs solve thier problem. with that in mind, youre saying more drugs will solve thier problem.

Here's a quick FYI, so you'll quit spreading this ignorant misinformation - oxycodone is roughly 1.5x stronger than morphine. PURE, PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE diactylmorphine (heroin) is roughly 2x as strong as morphine, but virtually no one in the street is getting pure heroin. Average purity in the US is roughly 12-35 percent. This means that you are generally getting shit on the street that is WEAKER than morphine, making oxycodone 2-3x stronger than street heroin.
