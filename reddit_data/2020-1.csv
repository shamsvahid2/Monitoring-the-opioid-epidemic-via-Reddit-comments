É verdade, a SAD faz muita mer\*\* e não entendas esta resposta como defesa da SAD. Sabe deus a mer\*\* que lá vai quando decidiram prolongar o contrato ao SC.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Simplesmente o homem é amigo do Sérgio e tem muitas informações por ele. 

Então literalmente o rato é o SC. Queixinhas ao Record é de ratos.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Não me admirava que tivesse usado o homem para fazer de porta voz. Nem acho que seja algo assim tão grave.  

Discordo totalmente. O FC Porto não é clube de recadinhos e porta vozes na comunicação social, especialmente naquela que á primeira hipotese f\*de o FC Porto a força toda. Isto para mim, a provar-se, era rua imediata com justa causa.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Como disse depois da final da taça da liga, acho que faz bem em deitar para fora os podres desses otários que mandam antes que tenham hipótese de o culpar só a ele como fizeram com os últimos. Quando sair vão ser os outros a mandar as culpas para cima dele. Faz bem em defender-se. Não acho que o Sérgio tenha dito olha lá inventa aí isso. Acho que convém ao mano da CMTV fazê-lo porque o Sérgio lhe dá algumas informações em primeira mão porque são amigos. 

O Treinador do FC Porto não tem que defender-se ou deixar de defender-se. Tem que treinar e meter a equipa a jogar bem e ganhar jogos. Coisa que o SC não anda a fazer. Anda a receber um salario e a fazer contratações loucas ( coisa que ... ajuda para as contas ) para andar a armar-se em bom e mandar recados. NÃO ! O que ele tem que fazer é ensinar o Messifá a parar antes da linha de fundo, o Danilo a não perder a bola no meio campo, o Marega a não ser defesa da equipa adversária e o Soares tentar meter uma coisa redonda dentro dum espaço de 9 metros de largura sem bater na trave/postes e sair. É só isso que ele tem que fazer. Se fizer isso, é um super heroi songoku super guerreiro naruto pokemon ! Mas pelos vistos não faz.

&amp;#x200B;

O Unico rato que vejo no FC Porto é quem não faz o seu trabalho e anda só a mandar bocas. **Quem tem que limpar aquilo é quem se vier a candidatar a presidente. Quem tiver pulso para mudar, que se meta ao barulho. Estas a mandar bitaites e sindromas do ""mundo vai acabar a 28 feb."" é de rato.**

Queixa-se de falta de união, mas é o SC que anda a chamar capitães de merda, carradas de jogadores que ""têm problemas com o treinador"", mandar bitaites como ""eu sou mau mas os outros são piores"".

Quando sair do FC Porto vai ser bonito. Não tem honra, gosta de lavar a roupa suja na praça da rua.

&amp;#x200B;

É preciso ter muita lata para ser sempre ""quem deu um campeonato ao FC Porto"" mas quando não ganha a culpa é dos outros. Então eu digo, que ele não ganhou nada, foi a SAD que nessa altura estava em união e ganhou o campeonato!

&amp;#x200B;

Enfim, o escrito acima é baseado em insinuações e rumores, por isso **não vale nada**. Mas a ser verdade ( coisa que nunca saberemos ), é a minha opinião!",1
23,2020-01-30 16:36:16+00:00,"**Endorphins**

Endorphins (contracted from ""endogenous morphine"") are endogenous opioid neuropeptides and peptide hormones in humans and other animals. They are produced by the central nervous system and the pituitary gland. The term ""endorphins"" implies a pharmacological activity (analogous to the activity of the corticosteroid category of biochemicals) as opposed to a specific chemical formulation. It consists of two parts: endo- and -orphin; these are short forms of the words endogenous and morphine, intended to mean ""a morphine-like substance originating from within the body"".

sometimes you have to wait longer than 24 hours before taking a sub depending on how much you were using and what you were using especially if you use heroin with fetanyl in it .. so on those "" broke days"" you'll most likely be withdrawing but then again everyone's bodies are different.

I have Type 1 diabetes, Celiac disease, hypothyroidism(Hashimoto's), and *had* a small patch of morphea(localized scleroderma) on my lower back that has since resolved. I also had a ton of other biomarkers related to autoimmunity that were outside the normal range, plus inflammatory markers that have all improved significantly since eliminating problematic plant foods from my diet. Also, many of my mystery symptoms, chronic fatigue, etc. has gotten much better.

This may sound woo woo &amp; absurd at first, but if you do some searching on intestinal permeability, molecular mimicry, lectins, plant-based enzyme inhibitors, etc., you may come to the conclusion that GI problems &amp; dietary components are a major contributing factor to the pathogenesis of autoimmune conditions.

Individually they’re not that bad. It’s the way the underlying conditions interact. I have to see a rheumatologist, spinal surgeon, obgyn, urogynecolgist, neurologist &amp; 3 other specialists. We’ve moved 3 times and my husband is now working at a hospital that’s lacking where I need it. 

When I was put on narcotic pain medications years ago at Northwestern in Chicago, I was fully aware of the risks. They weren’t pushed on me unaware of what it entailed. I have a paradoxical reaction so they don’t make me tired. I was doing relatively well working with disabled children. I didn’t have to spend my life in hospitals. Then the state legislature where we now live set a limit for what doctors can prescribe. After so many years, it was less than half of a dose I was doing well on. I can’t write my representative or say anything. I feel like a pariah every time I read the news. 

Getting those things diagnosed involved every stereotype about doctors dismissing women’s pain. I once crawled out of an ER where the doctor didn’t examine me, later to find I needed emergency pelvic surgery and had two intestinal infections.

After the pain meds were cut, I was told they did a study that people on both pain meds and my anti-anxiety meds are more likely to commit suicide. I’m now being taken off that too. If I didn’t have family support, THAT would make me feel suicidal. If the study was recent, all of the long term chronic pain patients would be on reduced doses. I think the loss of function or underlying conditions can make people suicidal, but how I respond is irrelevant. Since the pain meds and anxiety meds have been reduced, I have trouble showering &amp; getting dressed. Can only do it about once a week.

I feel so badly for people negatively affected by overprescribed pain medications. But all forcing reduced doses seems to have done where I live is leave people who could function in limbo, and cause an influx of black market fentinyl from China that’s caused a number of overdoses among recreational drug users. I wish every day I could throw the now 10 prescriptions I take to compensate for the decrease in pain and anxiety meds out the window. But I really just want them to be able to be prescribed responsibly but effectively. I want to try the ketamine treatment for my depression, but it’s not offered here. The human body really sucks sometimes. I wish I could write that everyone should throw out their meds. I’ve tried every alternative. And I still feel so guilty.",1

E pode voltar à corte em março, se tudo correr bem na recuperação dele —o magistrado se submeteu a cirurgia para colocar prótese no quadril.

 ### DE VOLTA 2

 A volta de Celso de Mello é esperada com expectativa: seu voto é considerado crucial em questões como a do [juiz das garantias](https://fotografia.folha.uol.com.br/galerias/1654731386953490-entenda-o-juiz-das-garantias), que [racha o Supremo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/fux-suspende-juiz-das-garantias-por-tempo-indeterminado.shtml).

 ### SOL

 O magistrado segue defendendo com entusiasmo a [implantação do sistema no Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/01/suspensao-de-juiz-das-garantias-ameaca-imparcialidade-de-processos-afirma-instituto.shtml). “Não há nada de novo sob o sol”, disse ele à coluna no domingo (26), lembrando que mecanismo semelhante ao do juiz das garantias já é adotado em SP há quase 40 anos.

 ### SIMPLES

 Ele refuta o argumento de que muitas comarcas têm apenas um juiz e que seria difícil, portanto, adotar o modelo no país: “Não há dificuldade e muito menos mistério na solução desses casos”.

 ### TABELA

 “A própria lei aprovada dá a resposta, com todas as letras: nestas situações [de comarcas com um só juiz], os tribunais constituirão um sistema de [rodízio de magistrados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/12/especialistas-dizem-ser-dificil-implementar-juiz-das-garantias-e-cnj-cria-grupo-de-trabalho.shtml).

Datena disse que não gostaria de disputar nada com Covas, pois gosta dele “pra caramba”.

 ### QUASE

 O apresentador diz ainda que, depois da “trombada” de ter que colocar cinco stents no coração, a possibilidade de sair candidato está “quase descartada”.

 ### ESPERA

 Uma ala do PT de SP passou a defender o adiamento das prévias do partido para a escolha do candidato a prefeito,[ marcadas para março](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/01/lula-convoca-pre-candidatos-do-pt-em-nome-de-acordo-para-a-prefeitura-de-sp.shtml).

  ### *LEMBRANÇA*

 O governador de SP, João Doria, e a deputada estadual Janaina Paschoal (PSL-SP) compareceram ao ato solene em memória às vítimas do Holocausto, realizado no domingo (26), na Congregação Israelita Paulista, em São Paulo. O ex-ministro Celso Lafer, o presidente da Federação Israelita de SP, Luiz Kignel, o sobrevivente do Holocausto Tomas Venetianer e o arcebispo de São Paulo, dom Odilo Scherer, estiveram lá.

  ### PORTAS FECHADAS

 A [atriz Regina Duarte](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/regina-duarte-posta-video-contra-marxismo-cultural-e-retoma-guerra-de-alvim.shtml), que foi [convidada para assumir a Secretaria Especial da Cultura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/regina-duarte-diz-que-noivado-com-governo-ainda-nao-e-casamento.shtml), rebateu críticas do ministro do Turismo, Marcelo Álvaro Antônio, [sobre o filme “Bruna Surfistinha”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/08/prostituicao-para-mim-foi-a-busca-de-um-heroi-diz-bruna-surfistinha.shtml) em uma reunião em Brasília na semana passada. 

 ### NÃO PODE

 Ele afirmou que o longa é um exemplo de projeto que o governo não deve apoiar. A atriz respondeu que o filme tem classificação indicativa e que a [prostituição é a profissão mais antiga do mundo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/saopaulo/2016/08/1798212-pesquisador-organiza-roteiro-sobre-a-historia-da-prostituicao-em-sao-paulo.shtml). Reforçou aos presentes que é uma artista e que eles não poderiam se esquecer disso. 

 ### TELAS

 Um dos papeis mais emblemáticos da atriz foi o da [Viúva Porcina](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/01/e-sinhozinho-malta-na-presidencia-e-viuva-porcina-na-cultura-diz-lima-duarte.shtml), uma ex-prostituta, na [novela “Roque Santeiro”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/09/roque-santeiro-revela-como-censura-opera-durante-e-apos-ditadura.shtml).

Gianfrancesco Di Matteo já foi notificado.

 ### RINGUE

 A tentativa de expulsão é mais um lance da [disputa judicial entre a família de Gugu e Rose](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/01/justica-determina-que-viuva-de-gugu-receba-pensao-de-r-100-mil-por-mes.shtml): ela quer o reconhecimento de que tinha uma união estável com ele, o que a deixará com direito sobre a metade de todo o patrimônio.

 ### LAR

 “A casa é o lar de Rose. E o irmão está lá para dar apoio a ela neste momento difícil. Vamos pedir a exclusão de Aparecida [Liberato, irmã de Gugu] como inventariante, por conflitar com o interesse dos filhos e da viúva”, diz o advogado Nelson Wilians, que representa Rose.

 ### ZÍPER

 A família de Gugu não comenta os assuntos do espólio e da disputa judicial.

 ### DIREITOS

 Advogados de familiares de vítimas da [tragédia que matou o time da Chapecoense em 2016](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2016/11/1836591-aviao-com-equipe-da-chapecoense-sofre-acidente-na-colombia.shtml) foram à Bolívia se reunir com o ministro dos Transportes daquele país. 

 ### DIREITOS 2

 O objetivo é cobrar do governo boliviano que se responsabilize pela autorização do voo saído de Santa Cruz de la Sierra (e que caiu na Colômbia sem combustível) e pelo pagamento de um seguro obrigatório.

 O gaúcho responde aos acenos levantando o braço. Foram ao menos dez cumprimentos em uma hora de entrevista, incluindo os apertos de mão na beira da praia de Rainha do Mar, em Xangri-lá, onde ""veraneia"" há pelo menos 50 anos.

 Seu aniversário será celebrado no dia 1º, em Capão da Canoa, mesma cidade litorânea onde liderou a passeata das Diretas-Já em 1984, com cerca de 50 mil pessoas em um domingo de verão.

 Nascido em Caxias do Sul, onde iniciou sua vida política como vereador, foi deputado estadual, federal, governador, ministro e senador. [De 1979 a 2015, ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/10/1525642-aos-84-anos-pedro-simon-corre-para-evitar-derrota-esmagadora-no-rs.shtml)[Simon](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/12/1560551-simon-se-despede-da-vida-publica-com-criticas-ao-pt-e-defesa-de-barbosa.shtml) só não se elegeu para o Senado quando foi eleito governador. 

 O emedebista tem viajado pelo Brasil para realizar palestras gratuitas para estudantes. Seu livro de cabeceira é a Bíblia, que alterna com leituras sobre atualidades. Incentivado pela mulher Ivete Fülber Simon, ele pratica pilates, vai à academia e sobe e desce seis lances de escadas do seu apartamento, no bairro Petrópolis, em Porto Alegre. 

  Lembrado especialmente por sua atuação pela redemocratização, Simon acredita que, sob o governo Jair Bolsonaro, a ""democracia está bem"". Diz que votou em branco pela primeira vez em 2018 e negou ter dado ""apoio crítico"" a Bolsonaro, como o MDB gaúcho no segundo turno.

      

 **Depois de sua luta pela redemocratização, como o senhor avalia o Brasil de hoje? A democracia vai bem ou mal?**  
 A democracia está bem. Tivemos os governos do PT, que todo mundo se assustava. ""O Lula, que vai implantar o comunismo, o não sei o quê"", diziam. Sob o ponto de vista institucional, ele se saiu bem.

 Teve o [Fernando] Collor, um cara todo complicado, cassado pelo impeachment. Saiu o impeachment, a normalidade democrática continuou. O Itamar [Franco] foi um governo espetacular. Veio o Lula, o [afastamento da Dilma [Rousseff],](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2015/brasil-em-crise/) que não foi por corrupção, foi por não cumprir regras da administração pública. 

 Agora veio o Bolsonaro. Sob o ponto de vista institucional, estamos bem. Sinceramente, estamos bem. As reformas estão saindo, é altamente positivo. Uma das coisas que gostei do Bolsonaro, quando assumiu, foi convidar o [Sergio] Moro e dizer: ""Vai ser meu ministro da Justiça e da Segurança, ele vai ter plena e total [autonomia] e pode até ser meu filho [investigado], eu compreendo"". Agora, no dia a dia que estamos vivendo, a coisa está um pouco diferente. [O filho do Bolsonaro [Flávio]](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/flavio-bolsonaro/) está em uma confusão enorme e, em função disso, o Bolsonaro não está tendo mais aquela firmeza que ele tinha com relação ao Moro.

 **O que o senhor pensa sobre Bolsonaro?**  
 Ele fala demais e fala equivocado. Ele diz algumas coisas que não precisava dizer.

 Ele criou um problema com os israelitas, falou que ia transferir a embaixada de Tel Aviv para Jerusalém. Ele fez a confusão com o presidente norte-americano, que matou o general do Irã. Essas confusões que ele faz, ele não está sendo feliz.

 **Como o senhor viu [o episódio do secretário da Cultura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/secretario-de-bolsonaro-e-exonerado-apos-pronunciamento-semelhante-a-de-ministro-de-hitler.shtml) [Roberto Alvim, que parafraseou um discurso nazista]?**  
 É uma piada, não entendo. Fico pensando, será ingenuidade? Será falta de visão? Pegar aquela frase e mudar duas, três palavras. Não entendo. Acho que foi uma coisa à beira da irresponsabilidade. Foi muito infeliz.

 **O senhor se sente incomodado quando vê esse tipo de comentário? [O próprio Bolsonaro elogia o coronel Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml) [torturador na ditadura], por exemplo, uma figura que o senhor ajudou a combater.**  
 São as infelicidades dele. O comandante Ustra é uma figura já marcada, todo mundo sabe quem ele é. Lembrar ele para elogiar, essas coisas... Parece que ele quer se definir como o cara de direita. Nisso, ele não está sendo feliz.

 **O senhor defende uma coalizão de centro para as próximas eleições?**  
 A forma de se organizar pode ser a mais variada. Os de centro, os da esquerda, da direita. O essencial é um movimento que consista no que fazer, em torno de quem vamos nos reunir e para onde nós vamos caminhar. O Bolsonaro tem o movimento dele, o Lula tem o movimento dele.

 **Qual sua opinião sobre o Lula fora da prisão?**  
 Ele não foi feliz [quando saiu da prisão.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/11/em-discurso-lula-agradece-militantes-e-ataca-pf-procuradoria-e-judiciario.shtml)  
 Ele tinha que imitar o [Nelson] Mandela. Falar em união, em entendimento, que é hora da paz, organizar para fazer as coisas. Não para derrubar o Bolsonaro, não para unir o povo contra. Todo mundo imaginava que ia acontecer isso, o Lula e o presidente [em confronto]. Dessa briga, os dois sairiam ganhando. É isso que se imaginou. 

 Mas aí, surpreendentemente, acho que não foi o Bolsonaro, mas a equipe dele, deixou o Lula, não respondeu. Ninguém respondeu. Ele parou de falar.

 **O que o senhor acha do nome do Luciano Huck para candidato a presidente?**  
 Não vejo consistência nenhuma. Inventaram o Collor. A Globo elegeu ele presidente, deu no que deu. Esse Huck é um bom homem de televisão, um bom comunicador. Mas ser bom comunicador e ser um bom presidente são coisas diferentes. Acho que não tem lógica.

 Mas é que está um vazio. O Lula vai ser ou não vai ser [candidato]? Não sei. No meio desta confusão do Brasil, acho que temos que fazer alguma coisa. O problema é que essa eleição que passou, nunca aconteceu [semelhante] na história do Brasil. 

 Bolsonaro se elegeu sem fazer um comício, sem usar os programas de televisão, sem ir aos debates. Olha [a facada que ele levou.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/09/bolsonaro-leva-facada-durante-ato-de-campanha-em-juiz-de-fora.shtml) Muita gente diz que ele se elegeu por causa disso. Com essa confusão que ele cria quando fala, se tivesse ido para o debate, o pessoal tinha amassado ele.

 **Sobre Bolsonaro, na época da eleição o senhor declarou apoio crítico.**  
 Não, não.

 **Mas o MDB do Rio Grande do Sul fechou posição de apoio crítico.**  
 Eu votei em branco. Tinha certeza de que o Bolsonaro ia ganhar. Não tinha nenhuma dúvida. Não comprometi meu voto. Votei em branco. Não me arrependo de votar em branco. Foi a primeira vez na vida que votei branco. Fiquei velho para votar em branco, mas ali não tinha saída. 

 Eu gosto muito do [[Fernando] Haddad.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/fernando-haddad/) É um cara que tem dignidade, tem correção. Foi um bom prefeito de São Paulo, foi um bom ministro, não tenho uma vírgula contra ele. Mas o Lula comprometeu tudo. Tirou qualquer perspectiva de vitória quando a campanha não deu bola para o Haddad e era ""Lula livre, Lula livre"".

 **Como o senhor avalia a Operação Lava Jato?**  
 Sou totalmente a favor. No Senado, briguei, lutei [contra corrupção]. O Brasil se divide em dois: um antes e um depois da Lava Jato. Até a Lava Jato, é triste dizer, mas o Brasil era o país da impunidade. A cadeia cheia de gente, mas um cara com dinheiro, militar, um político e um grande empresário nunca iam para a cadeia. Lamentavelmente, o STF voltou atrás no meio do processo [sobre prisão de condenados em segunda instância].

 **O senhor acha que [as mensagens reveladas pela Vaza Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/entenda-os-episodios-da-lava-jato-discutidos-por-moro-e-deltan-em-conversas-vazadas.shtml) abalaram a credibilidade da operação?**  
 Todas as coisas que a gente vê, pode ter algum equívoco, coisa errada. Mas não vejo nada que influiu no processo. 

 Naquela época havia uma empolgação. Numa das falas, Moro com o procurador, [sobre o Fernando Henrique,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/moro-disse-a-deltan-temer-que-investigacao-melindrasse-fhc-afirma-site.shtml) e o Moro diz que não tem nada contra ele. O procurador denunciou, mas não teve nada. Foi uma das manchetes [da Vaza Jato]. Quando a Dilma nomeou o Lula chefe da Casa Civil, [o Moro publicou a gravação.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/03/1750807-ouca-a-integra-das-conversas-de-lula-reveladas-na-lava-jato.shtml) Não discuto... Só tem uma coisa: era verdade ou mentira? E se o Lula tivesse sido nomeado, mudava tudo. 

 **Qual a sua avaliação da configuração atual do STF?**  
 É muito triste. Legisla mais do que o Congresso. No início, achei positivo transmitir [sessões do STF] pela TV [Justiça]. Hoje acho que não. Fazem sentenças de três, quatro horas que não representam coisa nenhuma. Não é para convencer o povo, mas o colega que está do lado dele.

 **O que o senhor pensa para o futuro do Brasil?**  
 Tem coisas boas, por exemplo, cotas para os negros entrarem na faculdade. Mas os erros são tão grandes que a gente se pergunta o que vai acontecer. A elite brasileira é muito triste.

96,2020-01-26 05:54:07+00:00,"Josephus himself demonstrates how fallible the gospels are. The Pharisees were not hypocrites, as the gospels depict them.

E.P. Sanders, an evangelical Christian one of the most prominent Professors of Judaism, wrote of the Pharisees thus, citing Josephus as one piece of evidence -

&gt; ""Similarly with regard to the Pharisees: others could see their scrupulous definition and fulfilment of the laws as being merely external activity that masked inner hypocrisy and self-righteousness, but they did not themselves see it that way. They thought that God had given them his law and bestowed on them his grace, and that it was their obligation within the loving relationship with God to obey the law precisely.

&gt; How do we know that they saw it this way? Partly by common-sense inferences based on observation of other religious polemic and defences. There are, however, passages that show that Pharisees themselves (and their rabbinic successors) regarded love and devotion to God as standing at the centre of their attempt to obey the law in every detail. According to Josephus many people followed the Pharisees’ rules of worship because they admired their high ideals, expressed ‘both in their way of living and in their discourse’ (Antiq. 18.15). Josephus saw them as being ‘affectionate to each other’, and he said that they cultivated ‘harmonious relations with the community’—unlike the Sadducees (War 2.166). That is, the Pharisees paid attention to the part of the law that says to love God and the neighbour. These passages in Josephus do not precisely describe inner motive, but their general thrust is relevant. Josephus is claiming that the Pharisees were good and kind and that their devotion to God was admired. We should also recall the depth of that devotion, which we summarized above: the willingness to die rather than be false to what they believed.

&gt; Explicit statements about motive come in rabbinic literature. I know of no body of literature that so emphasizes the importance of right intention and pure motive, of acting in a spirit of love and humility. Thus Hillel, in a saying retained in Aramaic: ‘A name made great is a name destroyed’ (Avot 1.13). To Hillel is also attributed this statement: ‘Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving mankind and bringing them nigh to the Law’ (Avot 1.12). According to Hillel’s predecessor Shemaiah, one should ‘love labour and hate mastery’ (Avot 1.10). The Pharisees did not regard themselves as observing the law for the sake of self-glorification.

&gt; The topic of motive, ‘intention’, is even more directly discussed by the post-70 rabbis, making use of the phrase ‘directing the heart’ (to God). The scholar who studies much is not superior to his fellow, the common person, provided that the latter ‘directs the heart to Heaven’ (Berakhot 17a). Similarly the size of an offering does not matter, and all are called ‘an odour of sweet savour’. This is ‘to teach that it is all one whether a man offers much or little, if only he directs his mind towards heaven’ (Menahot 13.11). I do not know of any sayings of this sort that are attributed to pre-70 Pharisees, but rabbinic literature attributes relatively few sayings (as distinct from legal discussions) to pre-70 Pharisees. I propose, however, that here as elsewhere the rabbis were the spiritual heirs of the Pharisees.

&gt; We may conclude that the Pharisees did not see their meticulous definition and observance of the law as being hypocritical and that they were not consciously seeking self-glorification; they were motivated by true religious devotion and the desire to serve God.""

The fact is you are incapable of empathy. It wouldn't matter what examples I brought up. For instance, if I were to say that the main drug responsible for the opioid epidemic oxycotin was marketed as a drug whose time release was greater than it's actual efficacy by hours, you would still blame everything on a lack of self discipline. You would disregard the fact that doctors prescribing a 12 hour drug were actually prescribing a drug that wore off in 8. The manufactures knew this when they were selling and marketing it. The quicker a drug leaves your body the more addictive the chemical is. But, you know, no example would suffice. It's all a still discipline issue.

	“Are you the Tooth Fairy? You don't look like a fairy,"" the child said accusingly. I had been on my way to the goldfish bowl and had not wanted to disturb him.  I began to sweat.

	Fuck.  This was not the interaction I wanted.  I wanted to get the damn fish and be on my way.  I was running late and had a few collections in another wing.

	“Why don’t you look like the Tooth Fairy?  I thought you would be little, kinda cute, like a manga doll or som’sing.”  His words were slurred, his mouth being held together with wires, I more felt him than heard him.  

	What, eighteen, maybe nineteen?  Couldn’t be much older. So technically, I supposed, he was a child.  Certainly far too young to be lying there with the tubes snaking in and out, the slow drip of the bright yellow medication-laced saline counting out the remaining seconds.  I was there for the fish, not for him - not for him, not at that moment.

	But the fish wasn’t quite ready. He had a few more bubbles to burble.  I had time to kill

	The kid looked lonely, frightened.  I could believe that.  Everyone looked frightened when the drip was as slow as their breathing.  Hell, in this place everyone was frightened even if their departure date was decades away.  The surgeon in the lounge was doing her best to get on my list with the alcohol she was using to quell her panic.  The nurse at the front desk had a line ready to go up his nose when the next round of in-coming hit.  Yeah, they were all running to meet me as fast as they could but I was there for the pesky fish.

	I took a quick glance at the fish, it wasn’t belly up yet.  A few more minutes.

	I seated myself on the swivel stool beside the bed, removed the hood from my head and gave the kid the best smile I could manage.  It wasn’t bad.  I had my Beyoncé cosplay get-up down solid and in his morphined state he would not notice the shimmer around the edges.

	“What made you think I was a fairy, and the Tooth Fairy at that?  Next you will confuse me with Santa Claus.”

	The kid tried to laugh.  More like a grunting agony but I gave him credit.  Not many people could look me in the eye, even when I was wearing a costume, and laugh.  Sweet Dis, he was brave.

	“Ain’t no Santa Claus.  Fuckers took most of my teeth, I figured someone would come to collect them.  Probably the meter maid on West 100th.   I owe a shit load.”  He coughed, a drop of pink salvia flecked on his lower lip, a gray tongue ventured out from between the wires and licked it back.

	“Why?”  I was in no hurry.  The fish was investigating some purple plastic seaweed. 

	“The lot at the 24th precinct was always full, had to park somewhere.  Thought she would show me some professional courtesy.  Nope.  So who are you and why are you here?”  

	I could smell the panic rolling off from him.

	“A visitor perhaps?”  The fish’s eyes were beginning to cross, almost time.

	The kid snorted.  It sounded like a squeak.

	“No one comes to visit me.  No one wants to look at me.  It frightens them.  I can see my reflection in the television screen.  It frightens me.”

	Well, I had seen worse.  But mostly they had already been in my pocket when the body was mangled the way his was.  I exuded a little of my perfume and leaned in closer to him.  Yeah, he was smelling like me now, that sweet sickly stench of internal rot when the cells start collecting gas and the membranes start to rupture.  The fish was in better condition.

	“The 24th?”  I had done several collections there in my time.

	“Took the exam, right out of high school, then they said I had to wait until I was twenty one. So I did the patriotic thing and signed up day after my eighteenth.  Thought I would gain some experience and get college help.  All I got was this.”  His free hand gestured towards his head.

	“IDE?”  I knew what had happened, I could read the report in the front office from where I was sitting but it seemed like the polite thing - to make conversation.  The fish was starting to look punk.

	If he had been able to nod his head, he would have done so.  He tried another grin.  Yeah, they had taken most of his teeth.  He wasn’t going to be eating any steak with that mouth.

	“We got pulled over by a herd of sheep.  Right on top.  Took my buddy’s legs off.  So, who the fuck are you?”

	The fish was floating now.  Time to go.

	I stood, took on my golden light shimmer and held out my hand.  Afgahnistan was no place for a guy like this.

	“Your ticket home, son.  Your ticket home.”",1

As provas do [conluio entre Moro e os procuradores da força-tarefa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/veja-o-que-ja-foi-publicado-pela-folha-com-base-em-mensagens-da-lava-jato.shtml?origin=folha) evidenciaram o desprezo do juiz por seu juramento constitucional de submissão às tábuas da lei —e o perigo de subversão do sistema judicial. Os parlamentares agiram para assegurar a separação entre Estado-acusador e Estado-julgador, um pilar fundamental da democracia. “In Fux we trust”, [escreveu Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/in-fux-we-trust-diz-moro-a-deltan-em-mensagem-sobre-ministro-do-stf.shtml) a seu comparsa Deltan Dallagnol numa das mensagens que vieram a público. A decisão monocrática do ministro do STF —um desafio a seu pares, ao Congresso e à separação de Poderes— atesta a confiança nele depositada. Mais que isso: ilumina os contornos do Partido de Moro.

 Rússia, Turquia, Hungria e Venezuela contam-nos uma mesma história: a transição do governo populista ao regime autoritário passa, invariavelmente, pela politização do sistema judicial. A Justiça deve render-se à política, para calar as vozes dissonantes. Os [diálogos expostos pela Vaza Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/entenda-vazamento-de-conversa-entre-moro-e-deltan-e-impacto-para-a-lava-jato.shtml) mostraram que Moro e os procuradores não só operavam como parceiros mas também acalentavam um projeto de poder. Quando o juiz com causa metamorfoseou-se em ministro da Justiça, a articulação emergiu à luz do Sol. Moro, o homem que prometeu não se reinventar como político, traía sua palavra pela segunda vez.

 Notícias periféricas desnudam as dimensões da articulação. As reclamações ao STF contra o juiz das garantias partiram do PSL, o antigo partido de Bolsonaro, de duas associações de juízes (Ajufe e AMB) e de uma entidade profissional do Ministério Público (Conamp). Numa nota oficial, Moro celebrou a liminar de Fux. Os elogios salpicaram algumas páginas de jornais assinadas por devotos do ex-juiz e as páginas eletrônicas de blogueiros fieis. O Partido de Moro compõe-se de uma sigla partidária e de porta-vozes midiáticos informais —mas, sobretudo, de organizações corporativas de juízes, promotores e procuradores.

 Há tempos, a política infiltrou-se nos domínios do Ministério Público. Abertamente, no seu interior, organizaram-se “partidos” de esquerda (MPD, Ministério Público Democrático, fundado em 1991) e de direita (Ministério Público Pró-Sociedade, fundado em 2018). O primeiro, que sofreu uma cisão em 2016, circula na órbita ideológica do PT. O segundo, que apoiou a candidatura de Bolsonaro, gira no campo gravitacional do ministro da Justiça.

  As implicações da politização do MP estão à vista de todos: [o procurador Wellington Marques de Oliveira](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/procurador-que-denunciou-glenn-foi-do-exercito-e-ja-processou-lula-em-duas-acoes.shtml), que oferecera uma [denúncia vazia contra Felipe Santa Cruz](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/justica-rejeita-denuncia-contra-presidente-da-oab-acusado-de-caluniar-moro.shtml), presidente da OAB, agora reincide na prática da intimidação. O procurador sem limites [mira o jornalista Glenn Greenwald,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/sem-ter-sido-investigado-glenn-e-denunciado-por-procurador-sob-acusacao-de-hackear-a-lava-jato.shtml) protagonista da Vaza Jato, tentando transformar em crime a exposição de verdades inconvenientes. Sem surpresa, o Ministério Público Pró-Sociedade saiu em defesa do gesto de abuso de autoridade. O Partido de Moro instrumentaliza o sistema judicial antes mesmo de chegar ao poder.

 A democracia traça uma fronteira nítida entre as esferas da Justiça e da política. Moro saltou, legitimamente, de uma a outra para, ilegitimamente, demolir a muralha que as separa. Bolsonaro, o [nostálgico da ditadura militar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/bolsonaro-determinou-comemoracoes-devidas-do-golpe-de-1964-diz-porta-voz.shtml), o [adulador de torturadores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml), é um inimigo declarado da democracia.

&gt; Our life expectancy has been declining for 3 years now, which is unprecedented amongst developed nations. Last time it declined this consistently in the US was in the 1910s.

The ""decline"" in life expectancy was from 78.9 to 78.6, which is quite modest. The decline in the last few years was heavily driven by people dying from ODing on drugs, particualrly heroin and fetanyl. There are long-term challenges as well, primarily obesity, which is one of the leading reasons for lower life expectancy in Americans vs Europeans. There's also been a slight increase in the suicide rate.

Indeed, the rate of drug ODs is up about 70% over the last decade. And as drug ODs kill young and middle aged people, you see more ""lost years"" to them. Likewise, the rate of midlife mortality from obesity has increased by 114%. These obviously lower life expectancy, but they also are self-inflicted. The US actually only has about 2.8 million deaths per year, so 70,000 drug ODs would mean they account for 1 in 40 deaths in the US, and [given the age distribution of such deaths,](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/opioid-overdose-deaths-by-age-group/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) it's pretty obvious that they account for a large part of the ""drop"".

It should be noted that the US is not the only country seeing this, either; several countries seemed to see life expectancy ""peak"" in 2014 and then kind of level off or decline modestly.

According to the World Bank, we saw similar patterns in [Germany](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?locations=DE), [France](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?locations=FR), and [the UK](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?locations=GB). The US pattern is probably more extreme because of our drug ODs being layered onto whatever background phenomenon caused it in those countries.

&gt; Americans make more per capita than Europeans, but they also have to pay far more for free or extremely cheap services than most of their European counterparts

They pay for those things via taxes instead. On top of the usual income tax, Europeans also have VAT/sales tax or the equivalent thereof, which drives such prices even higher. US sales tax rates vary, as there is no federal sales tax - I live in a state with a 0% sales tax rate (suck it!), with the highest rate in the US being 7.25% in California. The European rates are vastly higher than American rates are. The rate in Germany is *19%* - and that's *below* the EU average. And note that sales taxes/VAT are regressive forms of taxation - they apply more heavily to the poor than to the rich.

It's also worth noting that Europeans have to pay more than Americans do for a lot of common products - many goods, like electronics and video games, are priced the same in Euros as they are in dollars, despite the Euro being worth about 10% more. This not only adds up, but also adds a double whammy as the VAT is based on the price of that product. So while they do get to skip out on paying for some stuff, they pay more for other things, and their tax burden is higher. And a lot of these goods are goods you buy all the time, while a lot of things you're looking at on the US list are costs you often pay only once or twice in your life.

According to the OECD, people in the US have substantially higher disposable income than Europeans do; the average French household has about $31k in disposable income, the average German household about $34k. The US? $45k.

American wealth is not illusory; Americans really *are* substantially wealthier than Europeans are.

And indeed, it's pretty obvious that Americans are wealthier if you think about it. Americans have larger houses than Europeans do, with more living space in them. Moreover, owning cars is not a burden, it's something that gives you a lot of autonomy (and ultimately, public transportation isn't necessarily cheaper in a lot of cases). A monthly transportation pass in NYC is $116; a monthly pass in Paris is 70 Euros. I spend less than that on gas and maintenance for my car, and I don't ever have to pay an Uber or taxi for one-off transportation and don't have to rely on other people's schedules.

Also, a quibble - university is not ""absurdly"" expensive in practice; most people get financial aid. The median student debt from going to college to get a bachelor's degree [is only about $25k,](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/13/facts-about-student-loans/) which isn't really unreasonable, given that going to college increases your earning potential by quite a lot.

&gt; To my knowledge, violent crime is significantly more common here. Not fun

Actually, this is untrue.

The US homicide rate is higher than the European rate, which is why you always hear about it.

The problem is, the reason why you hear about it all the time is because of propaganda. Not only is homicide a very rare crime - it accounts for less than 0.1% of all crime - but it is also just about the *only* crime that is substantially higher in the US.

Indeed, the European police have a tendency to underreport crimes; in Germany, for instance, the police were kind of infamous for discouraging people from reporting hard to solve crimes, as that would lower the crime clearance rate. In 2005, only 8% of German women who were raped reported it to the police, compared to about 1 in 3 in the US.

This creates the illusion of safety, but according to criminal victimization surveys like the NCVS and CSEW, you're actually generally slightly more likely to be a victim of crime (including violent crime) in Europe, though it varies by country (Switzerland, for instance, has lower crime rates than the US, whereas some eastern European countries are substantially worse than the US, with Russia being especially awful).

Moreover, US crime is actually heavily concentrated amongst a relatively small number of areas - Chicago, for instance, was responsible for about 5% of all murders in the US in 2016, despite being only 0.6% of the US population. It's also very unevenly distributed demographically - almost 75% of murders and robberies in the US involve blacks or hispanics, who make up only 30% of the population. If you're not a disadvantaged minority - so about 70% of the population - you actually experience a crime rate only about half of the national ""average"". Hispanics suffer a roughly ""average"" amount of crime (at about 18% of the population and about 20% of the crime), while blacks suffer *3-8x* the amount of crime that whites and Asians do, depending on the particular crime (and make up about 12% of the population).

These disparities exist in Europe as well, incidentally, but they have much smaller populations of disadvantaged minorities, so it isn't nearly as obvious. For example, in the UK, blacks are still about 3x more likely to be arrested as whites are on a per-capita basis (the same differential seen in the US), but as their black population is much smaller, it isn't nearly as obvious that blacks are arrested and incarcerated at a higher rate than whites are. While not European, Aboriginal Australians are incarcerated at nearly 10x the rate of the white population of Australia.

The US actually acknowledges these disparities, whereas many European countries try to paper over it to pretend like it isn't an issue.

&gt; Wages have stagnated since the 70s while the cost of living has consistently risen, and the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour doesn’t look like it’ll be raised anytime soon.

This is one of those Big Lies.

IRL, income in the US has approximately doubled in real terms since the 1970s.

This is very obvious if you look at, for instance, [the size of new houses,](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/new-us-homes-today-are-1000-square-feet-larger-than-in-1973-and-living-space-per-person-has-nearly-doubled/) which have increased by roughly 1,000 square feet over the same time period. People have more and better cars. People have more and better TVs. They have cable/satellite TV, internet, computers, laptops, smart phones, cell phones, video game systems. They have air conditioning and central heating at vastly higher rates than they did back then.

All you have to do to disabuse yourself of this lie is to think about a 1970 home, and everything in it, and compare it to a 2020 home, and everything in it. If wages were indeed stagnant, then one would have to be willing to consider those two things to be an even trade.

But they're not. Not even remotely. The 2020 home and everything in it is bigger, better, and has more and nicer stuff.

It's just pure propaganda, mostly spread by monstrously evil people on the far left who claim things like ""These days, the American dream is more apt to be realized in South America, in places such as Ecuador, Venezuela and Argentina, where incomes are actually more equal today than they are in the land of Horatio Alger."" Because nothing says the American dream like [socialist death squads.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/venezuela-worlds-highest-murder-rate-200123135543539.html)",1

But Switzerland, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Belgium, Canada, and Luxembourg all have it.  Unfortunately even though they have 20 years of study and proof that it works, most countries are sticking with their suboxone programs. Like France and the US. Although I know of some hardcore junkies in france that do get prescribed ""SKANA"" which is injectable morphein. But you have to show for years that nothing else works. Where as HAT program requires two failed attempts of using a suboxone program. Which is much more realistic. Look up the stats that accompany HAT programs in those countries. Huge drops in B&amp;E (like 95% drop) and other crimes, also over doses etc. The stats speak for themselves. And addicts can live normal lives, have jobs and families.

There's a **very good** reason why weed is so widely pushed for legalization, as opposed to cocaine, meth, and heroin.    

&gt;If you don't know or understand the current drug epidemic then I encourage you to conduct more research.  

That's rich coming from you, considering the current drug epidemc was created by pharmaceuticals pushing ***legal opioids/opiates*** onto doctors and patients. More people abuse Oxycotin/Vicodin that Heroin/Meth. Look it up.",1

It's probably not you guys, it's the dope you are doing . 

Yea next time we tried to detox we decided to do cold turkey. It want until day 3 that It became like BAD bad so that was when it was probably appropriate to take the subs.

I mean what do you want me to do

I am arguying for a single payer system

&gt;So they would have an incentive to give you as many MRIs as you want. Great, except now there is snowballing costs involved with that.

I Agree overmedication is a problem (it still exist in America btw)

People don't blame the doctor when they refuse to give a treatment generally

It is in fact the job of the doctor to explain risk and reward of specific procedure

Overmedication generally occur with cheaper drugs so it's not that big of a problem

&gt;they would have an incentive to give you as many MRIs as you want

While  doctor never had an incentive to administer dangerous and costly drug like I don't know oxycotin for example 

&gt;convalescent care and almost certain terminal illness

As long as someone wish to stay alive they are entitled to it
sometime certain costly procedure have a queue and in this case the priority goes to the healthier one it is a way better method of choice than just the amount of money that you have in your bank account 

&gt;Who makes that decision


(In france)The decision is usually taken succequently by different entity in non critically urgent case a first broad one taken upon life expectancy-medical history and second by  person able to be doing the treatment estimating the chances of success

The decision taker are anonymous (theorically)

The suicidal thoughts, the way I don't feel like I'm probably I capable of living up to what I'd consider to be a life worth living.

Uzmi kao primjer legalizaciju pojedinih droga. Koristi od legalizacije su svima poznate - više novca prikupljenog od poreza, bolja kontrola, eliminacija/smanjivanje crnog tržišta/dilanja/šverca droge, itd. Međutim, društvena šteta koju legalizacija marihuane uzrokuje sigurno je manja od legalizacije heroina, zbog čega i puno manji broj zemalja naginje legalizaciji heroina (da, da, imaš primjer Portugala, i možda još 1-2 zemlje). Uvijek imaš pluseve i minuse, pitanje je samo ukupne bilance. 

Po pitanju uvođenja automatskog oružja u kategoriju sportskog/rekreativnog streljaštva, koji su benefiti? Još jedan oblik zabave/razonode za stanovništvo?  OK, ali i nije neki veliki plus. Dodatan izvor zarade? OK, ali opet, nije nešto presudno. Navodno povećanje sigurnosti zemlje? U zemlji koja je već pri dnu stope kriminaliteta u svijetu, ne znam koliko to ima smisla. A recimo, moguće negativne strane su povećana dostupnost automatskog oružja, stvaranje atmosfere da je automatsko oružje normalna stvar u svakodnevnom životu, moguće povećanje broja kretena koji znaju rukovati automatskom puškom. Dakle, nemamo nekih bitnih benefita od toga (jer povećanje prikupljenog poreza i novi oblik razonode po meni nisu najbitnija stvar za neko društvi), a imamo potencijalne negativne strane koje mogu biti jako negativne. Meni je nekako bilanca na negativnoj strani.

Što se tiče tog argumenta sigurnosti, ja živim u Zadru koji je prema onoj statistici od neki dan 2. grad u državi po stopi kriminaliteta per capita. Živim u prosječnom kvartu (u ZD i ne postoje neki elitni kvartovi), i živim normalnim životom - idem na posao, po kvartu, vani, bez nekih posebnih mjera sigurnosti. I uz sve mane i seljakluke u ovom gradu (kojih ima, neću lagati), ne znam da sam se ijednom u životu našao u situaciji u kojoj bi mi pištolj bio jedino rješenje problema. U kurac, ne znam da sam i jednom vidio pištolj ili pucnjavu na ulici ili situaciji koja ne uključuje lov i proslave nove godine i slične fore. U takvom društvu, mislim da bi povećanje dostupnosti vatrenog oružja moglo samo izazvati negativne posljedice.",1

For most people that’s the hardest part for my that’s the easiest for me so this time around I’m going to just stay on 2.5mg for the rest of my life because I have OD two times last one i woke up with a tube down my throat and was on a machine. Idk my dr thought it was a good idea because I am
Sort of a special case I guess. To stay on a low dosage my rest of my life. I should be taking 2 a day 16mg but I only take 2.5 like every 3 days I honestly forget about most of the time but I do go to gym and I feel like it affects me in the gym. Why I take as little as possible. I went 4 days without it didn’t really feel any withdawl but I did get craving so thought it was a bad idea. I honestly don’t know if I wouldn’t even withdawl. Maybe I am
Just blessed with good genetics or something because in my rehab groups I have always felt people over exaggerate the withdrawals to use .I know I would fake them so my mom wouldn’t stop me. But yeah you should really get supervised when coming completely off they can wean you off with Benzo and Clonidine.  (Never has a thing for benzo.) but if you are benzo addict I wouldn’t recommend it. Don’t take anything narcotic by your self also. Only under a dr. Was a pharm tech and also dropped out of nursing school because of a criminal charge I picked up lol. Suboxone is a partial agonist and doesn’t bind every opioid receptor so I would assume some of your Endogenous opioids are still working. I mean at least the way the science is explained the say suboxone withdawls shouldn’t be as harsh but many people say the are not as bad they just last way longer. I wish I could help you more but I’ve never had a suboxone withdawl only fentanyl oxycodon herion and Vicodin. But they also said fentanyl withdawls are the most harsh but they are quick to go away. Idk herion was the worse one for me maybe because I wasn’t really doing fentanyl enough to get the full one. But I would always take a benzo or drink when I was withdawling it really helped not saying you should lmao sorry for a bunch of pointless rambling. Going as long as you can then using the tinyest amount to get your self out then doing it again has always worked for me as long as you don’t go out and use I feel like you can trick your body in to turning your natural production on with out completely reseting/ shutting your self down. People go out and use a full dosage to get them self out that’s when I feel like you just reset your withdawl and will have restart completely back from the first day. I kind of learned that trick threw using steroids because you can take a certain amount of testosterone before you body will shut down completely and even if you use a small dosage it will only turn down your natural production it will only completely shut you down if you are using crazy amounts. / enough to fully replace your natural production or more. This is all just bro’science and anecdotal. I don’t recommend doing any of it a dr will certainly never run a protocol like that.",1

E mult mai usor sa devii dependent fizic de heroina decat MDMA sau alcool.

E mult mai usor sa cedezi la dependenta psihologica cand vine vorba de heroina in comparatie cu MDMA si alcoolul.

E mult mai usor sa faci supradoza de heroina in comparatie cu MDMA sau alcoolul (LD50 la heroina e de 6 ori mai mare decat doza terapeutica, la alcool e 10 parca si la MDMA 16)

Toleranta dispare mai rapid la heroina, astfel facand probabilitatea de supradoza si mai mare, daca consumatorul nu a avut acces la heroina cateva zile si isi ia doza pe care stia ca o ia el va face supradoza sigur 

Sevrajul la heroina e mai dur fata de cel de la alcool

Tbh that team is awful against anything. Vestal doesn't like to be paired with Antiq (two passive heroes is bad) nor with Leper (Leper wants people who can pull, buff him or deal with the back while he hits the front, and he doesn't need Vestal's healing). It lacks stuns and backline damage, so anything dangerous will destroy you.

&gt; Graverobber-Plaguedoctor-Occultist-Antiquarian

That team is actually pretty decent. Having off-healers mitigates most of the danger of 0 heals, and you have two of them. GR deals more damage to Blighted, and both PD and Antiq can blight. Between PD and Occ you should have enough stunning (tip: put Occ on rank 1 so he can stun while GR dances). The team is a bit lacking on damage, so for higher levels I would swap the Antiq for a BH or a Shieldbreaker.

&gt; any other combinations that shouldn't really work, but do?

I think the wackiest I have done is a no healer run (no off healer and most of the team were not self healers either).

Und ignorier diese Binsenweisheit mit ""blooooosss nicht operieren lassen"".     

Fakt ist:        
Es gibt Bandscheibenvorfälle die operiert werden müssen. Punkt. Sei es weil ein neurologisches Defizit entsteht, sei es weil die Wirbelkörper oder Begleitstrukturen geschädigt werden.      
Sicherlich, in Deutschland gibt es viel zu viele Bandscheiben-OPs - aber es gibt leider auch genug Patienten die aufgrund fehlgeleiteter konservativer Behandlung langfristige Schäden haben. Diese Schäden sind dann auch deutlich umfangreicher, langfristiger und lebensverändernder als eine ""Mikrodeko""(der Modeeingriff) zu viel.     
Mein Tipp daher: Such dir eine zweit und Drittmeinung. Idealerweise eine klinische und zwei niedergelassene Meinung.   
Wenn es wirklich zu einer OP kommt geh in ein absolutes Fachkrankenhaus das diese Art von OP in dreistelligen Zahlen pro Jahr durchführt. Auch wenn du 500km weit fahren musst. (Ich kann dir für Süddeutschland/CH gerne Häuser empfehlen)        
       
Wenn du Schmerzen hast und es geht nicht mehr,dann trau dich a) zu Hause zu bleiben b) Schmerzmittel zu nehmen c) um Hilfe zu rufen. Auch diese Mär vom ""Bloß keine Schmerzmittel nehmen"" ist absoluter Bullshit - genau so baut man sich wunderbar ein Schmerzgedächnis und ein chronisches Schmerzproblem.      
D.h. nicht du sollst sofort zur Oxycodon greifen wenn es mal zwickt (so entsteht ne Opiatkrise), aber wenn du anfängst nicht mehr zu schlafen, es in Ruhe scheiße wird und du nicht mehr zu Recht kommst.... Darf es auch mal mehr als ne Paracetamol sein.       
Wenn du dauerhaft Probleme mit Schmerzen hast such dir bitte bitte frühzeitig eine multimodale Schmerztherapie, auch wenn du vielleicht für den Start mal 3 Tage wo stationär hin musst. Es lohnt sich.       
Last but not least: Mach bitte keine Übungen mit Gewichten ohne Begleitung eines Physios - die Wahrscheinlichkeit das du ne Schiefhaltung und damit einseitige Belastung hast/entwickelst ist sonst einfach zu gross.

I've never owned a pitbull but I've had several friends own them without incident. Most reasonable people would agree that it's the fundamental training that determines ones behavior.

I do believe that there is something to be said about a pitbulls bite though, as it's jaws are unquestionably powerful. Again, it's important to train your dog daily and be a responsible owner.

Gotta love the government crackdown on narcotic pills having unintended consequences.

It really pisses me off knowing how much unnecessary suffering I endured, and how much money I lost that i'll never get back (as well as spent on useless treatment, and lost in terms of future potential revenue/profit from those same clients I had to turn down).

227,2020-01-18 04:37:04+00:00,"In the second case, it’s actually normally reversed. Drugs are often used to self-medicate preexisting mental health issues. In the process, you develop a dependency/addiction to the drug since it completely throws off your chemical balance amongst other things. Heroin is so popular because it makes people feel ‘normal.’ It mellows you out, but let’s you retain a pretty good grip on yourself when you’re on it. However, there are certain heroin-based substances that will completely fuck a person up (fetanyl is especially bad), so understand that I am generalizing. 

Drugs, as one would expect, aren’t a good way to cope with whatever issues someone might be experiencing, but they start off cheaper than therapy and a lot of the over-the-counter stuff.

Besides all of that, medical bills are actually the leading cause in American homeless, taking the majority via 1/3rd.  Low income (less than 50% of monthly income left after rent) is also a huge contributor. Disabilities are also pretty common in homelessness. 

Some people start taking drugs after they get tossed out, since drugs like cocaine help you cope with pain (especially hunger pain), while other drugs help mellow you out or ‘drown your sorrows.’ Homelessness, understandably, really stresses those affected out, which connects back to my point that people can use illegal substances to self medicate.",1

We ended up getting pain killers (Vicodin), throwing up was induced by the pain and spasming, so also got nausea medicine. Both worked well and now a few weeks later Im all recovered.

Total bill was $80 + another $20 for the Vicodin/Nausea medicine.

Overall experience was fine, but wait times sucked. But we kind of knew that going in. It was at 6PM on a Friday (we were there until about 4AM). They got 1 doctor for the ER and Urgent care and about a dozen nurses. They take people as fast as they can. But there is so much a doctor and a dozen nurses can do. Could they staff up more? Yes. But that would probably mean higher costs for patients (to pay the salaries). 

Do I think its a problem? Yeah... do I have a solution? Nope.

241,2020-01-17 00:21:46+00:00,"My first: (5 now)
Girl, by the end of the pregnancy i had super swollen ankles. Only worked part time until 7 months along then moved out of state, didn't work again until after birth. Started out at 120lbs, gave birth at 145lbs. Was 40+3 when I was induced.

Induced, vaginal birth with epidural. Only took a couple hours, didn't seem as bad as I expected it to be. She had no issues, but was jaundice for a week or so after birth (I'm rh- at O- and she is A+). 

My nipples bled, cracked, cried during breastfeeding and almost gave up until I eventually started treating them and using shields. Despite getting better I only lasted 5 months before my work schedule made it hard to keep up with my supply and I dried up. Struggled so hard with adjusting to an erratic sleep schedule, got frustrated all the time, etc. She cried a lot, and was super picky over who held her or what you were doing with her.

Second: (2 now)
Another girl, worked through the whole pregnancy full time almost to the very end. No swollen ankles, no outstanding physical pains or ailments to complain of. Started out 130lbs and ended at 155lbs. Was 38 weeks when induced.

Induced, vaginal birth with epidural. Birth itself was uneventful and again only a couple of hours, not painful besides the pressure. 

BUT Maybe 40 mins after I had my epidural put in I basically ""overdosed"" on the pain drip (didn't realize they used fentanyl or is it fentanol?). Woke up from whiting out with 2 doctors and 5 nurses standing over me panicking, they had to give me a reversal to revive me and keep baby from dying from my body shutting down. 

She was also jaundice for a week (A+ also). Took to breastfeeding much easier, no cracking or pain, but she did struggle keeping weight on her the first month. Put the work in to really pump when not feeding, take breastfeeding supplements, drink more water and juices, etc. Lasted 11 months until she got teeth and was grinding on my nipples with them. Boob privileges revoked.

Had an easier time dealing with her at night and made a more steam lined routine for any nighttime wakings. Much more easy-going baby than the first was.

Third:
Another girl. About 29 weeks along now. Going to school, working full time, no swelling or outstanding health issues. Have really bad reflux/heartburn at night now. Started at 130lbs or so, now I'm already at 154lbs and only gonna get heavier. 

Putting off buying as much baby stuff as before, despite starting all over after giving away baby stuff after the second. Reprioritizing what I'm really gonna be using and what seemed cool, but was useless or short lived.

Planning on getting another epidural, it was worth it despite my previous experience, just gonna wait and see what happens if my ""water breaks"" or if I'm induced again. Definitely going to breastfeed again, have pump already ordered.

Not to mention I went from using those huge gigantic tote looking diaper bags from the first baby, second I got a really cute backpack one but was much smaller and didn't carry a lot. Now I'm keeping it at backpack style but making sure it had room/storage space.",1

258,2020-01-16 02:03:41+00:00,"That’s actually a matter of tolerance, mix, and ROA.  Oxymorphone is definitely up there, but oddly, and I know I’m going to get a lot of hate for this, some of my most euphoric experiences have been with Fentanyl and Fentanyl analogues.

First one that I remember quite well...I was coming off of the tail-end of my most recent pill run.  I had just ended a big Opana bender and I was maintaining off of handfuls of shitty old MSContin.  Probably been maintaining off of MSContin for a week.  One of my dealers who was also one of my old buddies cousins had a few Fentanyl patches, no idea what to do with them, so he just gave them to me.  I had insufflated roughly 180mg of Adderall so I was not passing out any time soon, but it had been a minute so I wasn’t ripped up and sweating sheets either.  I took either one or two of the 100mcg Fentanyl patches and got to chewing.

I don’t know what the fuck it was, maybe the math just worked out with the timing of the Adderall, the ROA of the Fentanyl, and my current tolerance, but the high was bomb as fuck.  Fentanyl is normally weak as fuck on the euphoria, basically just a big snoozer, but I was ready to rock.  Probably the closest I’ve gotten to chasing down that first beautiful high I had off real Heroin back when I was 13/14.  I ran out of my apartment, mind you it was like 1:00 AM, and I hopped on the subway and proceeded to just rip around the city having a grand old time.

Second, although this may have actually been better and possibly beat my first Heroin high in a different weird way, was towards the end of my last run in the middle of a dark spiral.  As many of you already know, I went through a period where I was shooting Carfentanil like a motherfucking boss.  For any of you who have tried such a crazy thing, it normally sucks: you push the plunger, shit goes dark, then you wake up on the floor bleeding 8 hours later, and that’s best case.  I went through a period of a week or few where I was dying left and right like an asshole, but eventually my stubborn ass tolerance adjusted.

For any of you who have adjusted your tolerance to Carfentanil, the euphoria is impossible to describe as you know.  It also lasts forever.  The withdrawals at that point, though, are like your own personal physical holocaust, it’s brutal and I thought I would never escape it (still not sure how I did).  Any who, once I had adjusted, as some of you may know, you get this maximum intense mind-blowing euphoria and due to its turbo half-life it lasts like a fucking day.  It’s almost too much at some point.  This particular day, somewhat similar to the prior incident, I had been doing meth and decided to dose up heavy on the Carfentanil.  Somehow I Beautiful Minded that shit, math checked out, and blammo my brain erupted into fireworks of orgasmy delight.  In this particular instance, though, I did not leave my apartment, I did not pass Go!, I did not collect $200, I just sat there staring at a TV I’m not even sure was on enjoying the neurotransmitter parade going on in my head.

I will follow-up with complete honesty, though, and say that the day following the second incident was probably one of the roughest days not spent in withdrawal of my entire life.  I spent the entire very early morning painting my bathroom, floor to ceiling, in vomit.  I had a headache that felt like I was birthing Athena that all the shots would not get rid of.

Medio siglo que tal vez él desearía que fuesen 44: de 1976 es *Rocky*, la película que le dio fama y críticas entusiastas (no olvidemos que el héroe de acción del que luego la crítica se reía estuvo nominado al Oscar como mejor actor y mejor guionista en 1976 por esa película). Pero de 1970 es [la llamativa película erótica](//elpais.com/elpais/2019/03/11/icon/1552313437_198812.html) *The Party at Kitty and Stud’s* (Fiesta en casa de Kitty y Stud), en todo derecho la película en la que tuvo su primer papel protagonista por la que el actor, entonces casi en la miseria, cobró 180 euros.

     Cuando nació hubo complicaciones en el parto y los doctores se vieron obligados a utilizar fórceps para extraer al pequeño Sylvester. Un mal uso de los mismos dañó de gravedad un nervio y causó una parálisis en la parte inferior del rostro de Stallone

    Desde entonces, Sylvester se convirtió en uno de los actores mejor pagados de Hollywood, el arquetipo de un héroe de acción absoluto de los que ya no existen hoy y capaz de sorprender agradablemente a la crítica (*Copland*, de 1997, o *Creed*, de 2015) o espantarla (*¡Alto! O mi madre dispara*, de 1992). Su filmografía, repleta de películas en las que interpreta a héroes antisociales, hombres atormentados y conversadores más bien monosilábicos, es de sobra conocida. Por eso hoy nos vamos a detener más en una vida llena de tragedias y anécdotas que aún no entendemos por qué no se ha convertido, también, en una película.

 ### Una infancia marcada

 Y no solo por tener como madre a Jackie Stallone, una fuerza de la naturaleza a la que [ya dedicamos un artículo](//elpais.com/elpais/2019/05/08/icon/1557316240_430383.html). Ese rostro hierático de Sylvester, que en la última etapa de su carrera ha llegado a convertirlo en un inesperado actor de carácter, no es un recurso dramático. Cuando nació el seis de julio en 1946 hubo complicaciones en el parto y los doctores se vieron obligados a utilizar fórceps para extraer al pequeño Sylvester. Un mal uso de los mismos dañó de gravedad un nervio y causó una parálisis en la parte inferior del rostro de Stallone. Eso explica que mueva poco la boca, algo que con el tiempo se convirtió casi en parte de su identidad como intérprete.

          La portada de la revista People en la que Sylvester Stallone habló de la enfemedad de su hijo Seargeoh en 1985. Casi no ha vuelto a hablar de ese tema. Foto: People Magazine    

   Pero antes de llegar ahí, sus dificultades en el habla y su rostro diferente cuando era un niño le valieron ser víctima del acoso escolar de sus compañeros. “Me acuerdo todo el tiempo”, [relató](https://www.jornada.com.mx/2016/09/03/espectaculos/a02n2esp) durante un encuentro con jóvenes en Ciudad de México en 2016 en declaraciones recogidas por el periódico *Jornada*. “Cuando alguien es acosado eso nunca se va, es una cicatriz en tu alma, pero algunas veces puede ayudarte porque te dices que eso no volverá a pasarte otra vez”, dijo.

 ### Unos padres que no dejaban de ponerlo en evidencia

 Jackie Stallone, madre de Sylvester, es una estrella por derecho propio y en su currículum tiene las siguientes profesiones: trapecista, bailarina, boxeadora, azafata, peluquera, empresaria, presentadora, astróloga, lectora de traseros (tal cual) y concursante del *Gran Hermano VIP* británico. A sus 97 años sigue siendo un personaje público muy activo en Instagram. Su padre, Frank (fallecido en 2011) nunca fue tan mediático como su madre, pero a comienzos de los años noventa Jackie y él se enzarzaron en una guerra mediática que dejó tristes episodios. Como una discusión en directo por la radio en el programa de Howard Stern. “Déjame recordarte, hijo de puta, que me pegabas y me llegaste a enviar al hospital muchas veces”, le gritó ella. “¿Y ahora quieres salir por la radio y decir que eres un gran tío? ¡Nunca mantuviste a tus hijos! ¡Nunca te importaron una mierda!”, añadió Jackie.

 ### 2012, el año en el que le golpearon dos tragedias seguidas

 El año 2012 fue, probablemente, el peor en la vida del actor. En menos de un mes y medio perdió a su hijo y a su hermana. Sage Stallone (1976-2012), hijo de Sylvester y de su primera esposa, Sasha Czack, apareció en varias películas con su padre siendo un niño y decidió después estudiar cine para ser director. El 13 de julio de 2012 [falleció](//elpais.com/elpais/2012/07/14/gente/1342235398_298804.html) a los 36 años de edad por un ataque al corazón causado por una arterioesclerosis. “Esta agónica pérdida me dolerá para el resto de mi vida. Sage fue mi primer hijo y el centro de mi universo y pido humildemente a todos que dejen que la memoria y el alma de mi hijo descansen en paz”, [declaró a CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/16/showbiz/stallone-death-probe/index.html). Conocidos portales estadounidenses sensacionalistas como TMZ, entre otros medios, especularon sobre si la muerte estaría relacionada con el uso de drogas. Finalmente, se demostró que no era así.

   Solo mes y medio después, el actor perdió a su hermana, la actriz Toni D’Alto, hija de Jackie Stallone y de su segundo marido Anthony Filiti (era hermana de Stallone por parte de madre) por un cáncer de pulmón. Tenía solo 48 años. Por si la muerte de una hermana menor no fuera un golpe suficientemente duro hay que añadir la difícil relación que tuvieron: según trascendió después de la muerte de Toni, y la propia Jackie Stallone [reveló al periódico británico](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2270660/Secret-tapes-Sylvester-Stallone-half-sister-destroyed-abuse-payout-deal.html) *Daily Mail*, la actriz extorsionó durante años a su hermano cuando este estaba en la cumbre de su fama, a finales de los ochenta.

 Según averiguaron medios como el *New York Post*, Stallone llegó a pagar tres millones y medio de euros, incluyendo 36.000 euros anuales para gastos médicos y psiquiátricos, porque ella le amenazó con demandarlo por abusos. “Esto no fue más que un chantaje”, declaró Jackie. “Toni estaba tomando 65 pastillas de OxyCotin [un potente analgésico] al día y amenazaba a Sylvester. Un drogadicto hace lo que sea. Sylvester intentó ayudarla y se rindió. Por aquel entonces él era muy famoso y sus abogados le dijeron: ‘Es mejor que le pagues para callarla”. Según su versión, Stallone pagó para frenar un escándalo que podría haber dañado su carrera.

     Stallone llegó a pagar a su hermana Toni tres millones y medio de euros, incluyendo 36.000 euros anuales para gastos médicos y psiquiátricos, porque ella le amenazó con demandarlo por abusos

    Dada la situación es curioso que la relación pareciese, aun así, buena de cara a la galería: A Toni se la pudo ver en algún estreno de Sylvester (por ejemplo en el de *Rocky Balboa* en 2006) y su hijo Edd apareció en una película de Sylvester, *Copland*, en 1997.

 ### Seargeoh, su hijo autista

 En 1985 la vida sonreía a Sylvester Stallone*: Rocky IV* y *Rambo: Acorralado (parte II)* fueron un enorme éxito de taquilla. Pero una visita al doctor debido a comportamientos extraños de su hijo pequeño, Seargeoh, que se comunicaba con él y con su entonces esposa Sasha de una forma extraña, tuvo como resultado un diagnóstico de autismo. El propio Stallone [contó la historia](https://people.com/archive/cover-story-slys-silent-son-vol-23-no-22/) en la revista *People* ese mismo año. ""Simplemente, nos derrumbamos"", declaró sobre el momento en el que los doctores les dieron el diagnóstico. Desde entonces, el actor ha utilizado su fama para recaudar fondos para la investigación. Nunca ha vuelto a hablar demasiado sobre el tema y muy poco se sabe sobre él actualmente. Seargeoh ha crecido lejos de los focos y fuera de ellos sigue.

 Tanto Seargeoh como el fallecido Sage fueron los dos hijos que Stallone tuvo con su primera esposa, Sasha Czack, con la que estuvo casado desde 1975 hasta 1985. Entre 1985 y 1987 estuvo casado con la actriz y modelo danesa [Brigitte Nielsen](//elpais.com/tag/brigitte_nielsen/a), una turbulenta relación bien documentada por la prensa rosa de todo el mundo que daría para otro artículo.

 En 1997 Stallone se casó con la modelo Jennifer Flavin, a quien sigue unido 23 años después y con quien tuvo tres hijas: Sistine, Scarlett Rose y Sophia Rose. Ha tenido también relaciones con otras modelos como Angie Everhart (que aparece en la imagen que abre este artículo) o Janice Dickinson, considerada la primera supermodelo estadounidense y que afirmó que Sylvester Stallone [era el padre](https://people.com/archive/rocky-ending-vol-41-no-16/) de su hija Savannah, nacida en 1994. Pruebas de ADN demostraron, finalmente, que no lo era.

&gt;He is solid in his belief that rehoming a dog is so unforgivably morally heinous, comparable to killing a newborn baby. While I believe that people change, situations change, lives change.... and it is totally acceptable to find dogs a new home so long as they are taken care of. As much as I can't stand them I don't want them to end up in a shelter or abandoned.

How does he justify that it is morally heinous to re-home a dog? If he really wants to fight on that line, what about simply euthanizing it? To me, that a human, solely by choosing to feed a dog on one day, is not now indentured for life to this animal. It would be like me buying someone a Coke and then suing for child support.

However, beyond that there is the issue that dogs do not think like we do. It seems like he is assuming dogs and humans are the same—cognitively and socially.

Dog memory is nothing like regular human memory. Even primates come no where near what a human has. This is important because they lack the physical brain regions to have vivid complex “autobiographical” memories like humans do. 

They more or less see what is in front of them and it feels familiar or not. They have no real sense of self. They have no sense of time. They cannot think in multi-step processes. They can not compare two hypotheticals. This is important: it can’t and won’t look at the kennel door and compare it to your house. It won’t look at the new owner and compare it to you. The new owner will occupy its mind and its entire existence.

If an object disappears, within minutes they cannot know if it *ever* existed or will *ever* return (object permanence.) This is in part, why many puppies that are never allowed to be alone think their owner is gone forever when they go to work—and then act crazy and destroy things.

They may find their old owner familiar, or their area familiar, but they can not visualize it or contextual is it like a human can. 

They can’t compare past to present or hope for the future. They live in the eternal present. [Most casual Westerners (not neuroscientists) deny this, but in Asian philosophies, this present mindedness is a virtue and human goal though mindfulness is to reacquire that focus. To them; humans are *too good* at living in the hypothetical, in imagination, or focusing on the past and we can learn from nature.]

Dogs that are re-homed adapt. They do not “love” us, as much as they are dependent on us. We provide for their needs. Just like a lab rat learns to press a button for opium. Neurons that fire together wire together—doing the stuff we command gets tangled up with food rewards, so much they get a small shot of endorphins when we respond positively; even if we never make with the treat after the connection is wired. It’s Pavlovian conditioning.

We’ve bred that into them. What happens in their head is a firing of the VTA and the release of endorphins (*endo*- means “internal”; *-orphin* means “like morphine”). Their body tells them to eat, drink, mate, and excrete waste and then rewards them with a shot of endorphins when they are successful, and we’re the sole source of their physical needs in captivity.

Do you think the current compromise will be maintainable? What sucks is since neither of you are getting what you really want; it is very possible to resent the other *and* have to face that every day. If the dog is gone, hopefully a reasonably mature adult will adapt too. The dog is going to die anyway, so saying “goodbye” is already inevitable. Instead of the ground it is going to a home? Plus, once the dog is gone, the work, cost, risk to children, legal risk, house damage, etc. go with it... to then fill the time with a hobby or time more conducive to your changing family needs.

That said... the MIL really has no skin in this game. It is between you and him, not her. There are animal abuse laws on the books. Anything less than that is your personal discretion. If she doesn’t like it she can kick rocks. To me it has nothing to do with dogs—it is a third party getting between you are your husband.

My MIL has a tendency to go there... and it is infuriating. I’ve paid a high cost to communicate to my own family how quickly our relationship will collapse if boundaries are not respected—especially if she thinks she can pull rank on you as “grandma” or your husband’s “mom.” For me, I absolutely need for my wife and I to be the *only* voices in our decisions.",1

280,2020-01-14 15:03:02+00:00,"  O presidente Jair Bolsonaro classificou nesta terça (14) como uma ""ficção"" a produção brasileira ""Democracia em Vertigem"", [indicada na categoria de melhor documentário longa-metragem do Oscar deste ano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/petra-costa-e-indicada-ao-oscar-por-documentario-sobre-impeachment-de-dilma.shtml).

 Na entrada do Palácio da Alvorada, onde cumprimentou um grupo de eleitores, ele disse que [o filme dirigido por Petra Costa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/precisamos-resgatar-estado-de-direito-antes-que-seja-tarde-diz-diretora-de-democracia-em-vertigem.shtml), que relata [o impeachment da ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff (PT)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/dilma-comemora-indicacao-de-documentario-a-verdade-nao-esta-enterrada.shtml), é considerado de qualidade por aqueles que gostam de lixo.

 ""Ah, não, pera. Ficção. Para quem gosta do que o urubu come, é um bom filme"", afirmou o presidente.

 Perguntado pela **Folha** se havia assistido ao documentário para fazer a crítica, ele disse que não vai ""perder tempo com uma porcaria dessas"". 

 Além da saída da petista, o documentário aborda o impacto dos protestos de junho de 2013, a prisão do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva e a vitória de Bolsonaro na disputa eleitoral de 2018. 

  O presidente, inclusive, concedeu uma entrevista para a equipe do filme quando era deputado federal, que foi incluída no trabalho final. A estatueta será entregue em cerimônia no dia 9 de fevereiro.

 A produção da Netflix, que acompanha o acontecimento histórico a partir de uma visão particular da diretora, chegou à plataforma de streaming em junho.

 Não é a primeira vez que o presidente critica um filme sem tê-lo assistido. Em junho, [após atacar o longa-metragem ""Bruna Surfistinha""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/07/nao-posso-admitir-que-facam-filmes-como-o-da-bruna-surfistinha-diz-bolsonaro.shtml), ele reconheceu que não o viu.

 ""Eu não [assisti], pô. Vou perder tempo com Bruna Surfistinha? Eu estou com 64 anos de idade. Se bem que eu tenho uma filha de oito anos, sem aditivo"", disse.

 Em cerimônia de comemoração dos 200 dias do governo, Bolsonaro havia afirmado que não pode admitir que dinheiro público seja destinado a filmes como a produção do diretor Marcus Baldini e que teve a atriz Deborah Secco como protagonista. 

 [Em conversa com a **Folha**, a empresária e escritora Raquel Pacheco](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/08/prostituicao-para-mim-foi-a-busca-de-um-heroi-diz-bruna-surfistinha.shtml), cuja história inspira o filme, disse na época que a declaração do presidente foi ""infeliz"" e afirmou que, antes de ele fazer juízo de valor, deveria ""cuidar da moral de sua própria família"".",1

I am no fan of the institution that is the Catholic church, so we may align on some of the gripes you have there, but 
  
Gnostic manuscripts as well as the Apocrypha are a problematic argument as we'll take the Book of Enoch as an example dates at ~300BC-100AD, yet claims to be written by Enoch. This is typically identified as Pseudepigrapha. This book had multiple authors, not a singular author.  
  
Fair recently we have scholars citing:
&gt;In 1977 and 1978 the SNTS Pseudepigrapha Seminar discussed &gt;the Similitudes and came to the consensus that the unit was a &gt;Jewish work dated to the first century C.E. Collins points out an &gt;additional two sections in Similitudes which appear to refer to &gt;historical events (Collins, Apocalyptic Imagination, 178).1 Enoch &gt;56:5-7 refers to the Parthians, possibly just after the Parthian &gt;invasion of Palestine in 40 B.C.E. 1 Enoch 67:5-13 mentions hot &gt;springs, which Collins argues is an allusion to Herod’s attempt to &gt;heal himself at the hot springs of Callirhoe (Antiq. 17.6.5, &gt;171-173; War 1.22.5, 657-658). Collins concludes by speculating &gt;a date for Similitudes in the mid-first century C.E., before the &gt;beginning of the war in C.E. 66. Collins also states the Similitudes &gt;was written in Aramaic (Apocalyptic Imagination, 178). This date is &gt;of critical importance to New Testament studies since the &gt;Similitudes contain the “son of man” sayings.
https://readingacts.com/2016/05/20/when-was-1-enoch-written/  
  
Some scholars believe this was written by the [Essenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essenes), who followed a non traditional form of Judaism. Tough argument to claim this to be a cover up/omission of Biblical events when the dating of the text places it after the life of the men who actually wrote the Bible. The historicity of the claims within would then be called into question.     

Also, where in the Bible does it claim the text is infallible? Unlike Islam (where it does claim the text to be infallible), we have seen that Jewish scholars translated small errors on a scroll when making copies to keep the integrity of the process in place. Knowing there were several copies of the Torah/Pentateuch in circulation it would be easy to compare the scripture across all the manuscripts.  
  
Ever found a typo in a printed book? Does this ruin the veracity of the book, or in this day and age could we look at every copy and discern the ""truth"" behind it?
  
BTW when you searched ""Bible contradictions"" and copy pasted the first link,https://www.contradictingbiblecontradictions.com/?p=3185  did you bother to verify you linked me a site that is dedicated to refuting contradictions you are claiming?

Now, maybe if you read the article vs. jumping to assumptions (your response is full of them), you might want to also do some homework as to how much MD's know about DNR, full code, etc.  Are you aware of doctors that refuse to treat SEPSIS because a patient is DNR?  And that such actions are incorrect, dangerous, etc?

In my case, I KNOW it's because all that propaganda that I was fed almost since birth has been very effective. I have been working on allowing myself to use it as often as I need it.  When I use recreationally, the reason why I might use it is to relax or to slow down some of the thoughts in my overactive brain. Even then, I'm taking it medically.

I think its more likely that he is a poly drug user rather than there being some idiot dealer out there cutting their coke(a stimulant) with fentnyl(a strong depressant). 

Why would any dealer ruin their consumers stimulant high by mixing it with a fucking opioid? Imagine being a coke head buying coke from that guy, expecting a coke high but instead getting a mixed stimulant/depressant high.

I'm sure it happens occasionally but it seems more likely to me that he is simply a poly drug user who consumes both opioids(fentanyl) and coke. A huge number of drug users are poly users and use both uppers and downers.",1

388,2020-01-07 23:15:47+00:00,"Honestly, I do it from time to time when I’m alone. I’m trying to avoid it as much as possible in order not to get into an habit, but my experience is as follows (when I do it alone I’m almost always sober by the way):

I tend to make it quiet around me (as opposed to get as much music as possible around me when I’m not alone). I tend to turn off the tv and music for example.

After a few minutes I tend to grab my phone and I can’t help myself but to get on social media (like now) or chats. Often I start calling friends. Just ask how they’re doing and not much more purposeful.

Usually when it starts wearing off while I’m on the phone with somebody I try to hang up as I perceive it as ruining my vibe (probably not true, just bad timing, as it would wear off at that time anyway)

During this I enjoy just sitting on the couch in a rocking movement (I can’t sit still at all).

On occasion (during the day) I like to do something creative or play a (simulator) game while enjoying the vibe (sim city 4 is awesome on coke!)

It’s basically the same process for me as when I was taking Oxycodon regularly (last time more than two years ago, yay!)

I love to do it alone from time to time, but am very restrained with it as it can quickly turn into an ugly habit.",3

Third, both should be available. Everyone has problems, everyone makes mistakes, some are harder than others to recover from.

* The top artists, musicians and influencers will be robots, owned by major corporations.

* Pot is now legal in most areas of the US, except Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.  Louisiana however has legalized recreational use of Oxycotin, and Texas has decrminalized hate crimes.

* Autotune finally goes completely out of style (except in rap music, which merges with pro wrestling and forms a new art form called pro-rap-wrestling)

* Global climate change will no longer be controversial - everybody will acknowledge it's happening (which IMO is one reason why we should take names of those who stood in the way).  We'll try and fool ourselves that we can still do something about it, but we'll basically be reacting to new weather patterns, widespread droughts, floods and forest fires as well as collapse of various ecosystems.

* People will get tired of the two party system in the US and third parties will become more popular.  However, shortly thereafter, people will realize that third parties are just as corrupt as the major parties.

* After decades of bullying other small nations, the US will finally get its ass kicked.. hard, probably starting off by some terrorist acts, but when we react to it, we'll find that the rest of the world is no longer ""on our side"" and this will lead to a huge major war.  

* Genetic engineering hits its hey-day, as finally many diseases can be cured, however, this practice is illegal in the US unless you're super rich.  Travel agencies begin to set up trips to foreign countries for people to have a wide variety of genetic operations done.

* Abortion is now illegal in America, except for rich people.

* The republican party re-forms as a for-profit corporation.

* Australia will still be on fire, but Tyson Foods will purchase large tracks of land and use it to produce their newest product: smoked chicken wings.

* Cryptocurrency dies: Bitcoin stabilizes at around $80.   Tether goes bankrupt.   Amway acquires Etherium.",2

I was on the patch for almost 10 years due to crohn's issues (needed the slow down and pain relief). My crohn's got a wee bit better, and I saw the writing on the wall regarding opiates as I was already having issues getting my scripts filled. 

So went to pain clinic and during the slow taper, they also had to write a script for an anxiety/muscle relaxant. Not sure what the name of the med was. I also used RSO. Pre bought edibles didn't seem as effective as the RSO. I would take one dose about the size of a yogurt sprinkle of 85-92% RSO  on a cookie every 4-8 hours. The first week of taper is the worst and it gets easier the following weeks. For me, those weird muscle/body aches that come with withdrawl due to physical dependence lasted in some form for about 2 months on some low level.

 I now use cannabis for all my pain needs now. I usually rate pretty high on a daily basis due to my extensive medical history. I can't take OTC pain meds either because of said issues (NSAIDs due to crohns and Tylenol due to AI liver disease) so it's cannabis or nothing.  BTW, not complaining. Just so happy that I live in a medical state where I can get my meds.

404,2020-01-07 08:31:05+00:00,"Well, it was a flood of emotions that's for sure. When she was at the hospital the doctor called for a meeting with the family. When I went to that meeting I had one question on my mind ""How long will she live?"" It was the first question asked and he told me she had around 30 days. I told him, ""No she doesn't, my mom is not living past the 4th of July."" So we spent about an hour going over different things, hospice services, etc and then we left. She came home and lived for close to two weeks and then passed away on July 4th. I still have the texts and emails where I told different family members that she would not live past that day. Don't ask me how I knew, I just knew. I guess it was because she and I were very close (I'm the baby of the family) because I took care of her after my father passed (he instructed me to do it before he passed). I don't really know, but it happened. 

There were two moments that really hit me. 1. The last convo we had while she was at home and 2. when the coroner took her body away and drove off. Our last convo was short. I had to administer morphene, her meds for the ""death rattle"" and had to give her water via a dropper/syringe. I asked her was I a good son and she said ""yes."" I then started crying. She said, ""Don't cry because I can't cry."" That's the last time I ever heard my mom's voice. BTW, I'm tearing up while I'm typing this so it probably took me a bit to type this out. The second time was when the coroner drove off with her body. I touched the van and watched it pull out the driveway and drive up the street and disappear. It was calm feeling, and I wanted to cry, but it hit me that mom wasn't coming back. It's like a big punch hits you and it's a void that can't be filled. I thought about her, all the things she experienced, how to live without her, how to continue to be there for other family members, etc. I've experienced the stages of grief except for blaming a deity or whatever.

You don't need to stop all your supplements and stuff ahead of time, unless they instructed you to. Just continue your normal routine and let the anesthesiologist know what meds and over the counter stuff you're taking. Most of the time, it's not a big deal and they will adjust for it if it is. If you're doing this in a hospital as an outpatient, typically the anesthesiologist meets with you before you go in for the procedure to get your history.

I've been put under at least half a dozen times. I'm usually good to go 15 minutes after I wake up. Most people take a while longer. It's completely dependent on your genetics, the medications they use (which are decided based on your history and the length of the procedure in particular), and your tolerance/experience with the meds. In the US, the most common combo is Midazolam (Versed), Propofol, Fetanyl, and/or an inhaled gas.

I wouldn't worry too much about the horror stories. The only thing you might notice is that Propofol can cause localized pain when it's injected. I've only experienced this once and was soon as I noticed it, I was out. You'll be fine. Just listen to the docs and talk to them about your concerns and they'll talk you through it. Good luck!

 É isso que se depreende tanto das escolhas em si —""Fleabag” como comédia, “Succession” como drama— como da [lista completa de indicações](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/12/globo-de-ouro-alca-comedia-individualista-e-dramas-femininos.shtml).

 Não que “Succession”, o [competentíssimo drama de intriga familiar da HBO](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauriciostycer/2019/06/o-lado-obscuro-da-forca.shtml) agora em sua segunda temporada, não merecesse seu troféu. 

 Trata-se, porém, de aposta segura em uma premiação que vinha primando pelo vanguardismo, menos ousada e momentosa que a escolha de [“Handmaid’s Tale”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2019/06/handmaids-tale-substitui-distopia-por-heroismo-em-nova-temporada.shtml) em 2018 e menos emocionante do que a consagração, no ano passado, de [“The ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2017/03/1863789-serie-the-americans-volta-mais-sombria-na-quinta-temporada.shtml)[Americans](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2017/03/1863789-serie-the-americans-volta-mais-sombria-na-quinta-temporada.shtml)” em sua temporada final.

 A premiação de conjunto da obra, por sinal, foi algo que os jornalistas responsáveis pelo prêmio evitaram neste ano, reservando à[ saga “Game of Thrones”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/05/game-of-thrones-triunfa-no-final-ao-abdicar-do-obvio-e-escolher-otimismo-e-realismo.shtml) uma menção solitária na indicação de Kit Harington, o Jon Snow, a melhor ator dramático. Saiu de mãos vazias.

 Bem escrita e bem interpretada, “Succession” é um novelão de primeira linha sobre um tema conhecido, o da família rica que briga pela sucessão do patriarca (Brian Cox, premiado pelo papel) à frente de um conglomerado empresarial (no caso, de mídia). 

  A estatueta poderia ter sido entregue a “The Crown”, da Netflix, ou [“Big Little Lies”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2019/06/sombria-big-little-lies-se-firma-como-serie-anti-sex-and-the-city.shtml), da HBO, novelescas à sua moda, mas com o “twist” de partirem do ponto de vista feminino. “Big Little Lies”, aliás, fora contemplada há dois anos como minissérie, categoria em que se inscrevia antes de se saber que haveria sequência.

 Se entre os dramas se escolheu o único em que o ponto de vista não é exclusivamente feminino, entre as comédias o Globo de Ouro fez o oposto ao consagrar “Fleabag”, já chancelada em setembro pelo Emmy, o prêmio da academia que reúne o pessoal de produção de TV nos Estados Unidos.

 A [comédia-sensação escrita e interpretada pela britânica Phoebe ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2019/07/fleabag-usa-humor-acido-e-ousadiasexual-para-retratar-geracao-da-selfie.shtml)[Waller-Bridge](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2019/07/fleabag-usa-humor-acido-e-ousadiasexual-para-retratar-geracao-da-selfie.shtml) não deu chance a ninguém no último ano com sua narrativa pouco ortodoxa, suas piadas entre a autodepreciação e a escatologia e seu texto profundamente autorreferente, num espelho sarcástico da geração do selfie e das redes sociais. Waller-Bridge ainda coletou a estatueta de melhor atriz cômica, a maior barbada da noite.

 Surpresa foi o troféu da mesma categoria no páreo masculino ter ido para Ramy Youssef por “Ramy”, comédia da plataforma Hulu inédita no Brasil, também autorreferente e também com menções à religião, que brinca com os dilemas de um muçulmano nos Estados Unidos e sua relação com a fé.

 Deixou para trás os queridinhos Bill Hader ([“Barry”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2018/08/despretensao-e-protagonista-fazem-de-barry-um-alivio-entre-series-pesadas.shtml)) e Paul Rudd ([“Cara x Cara”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2019/10/em-cara-x-cara-ser-um-eu-melhor-e-um-peso.shtml)) e o veterano Michael Douglas ([“O Método Kominsky”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2019/11/em-2o-ano-de-o-metodo-kominsky-netflix-afaga-fas-da-comedia-classica.shtml)), em uma lista bem mais forte do que a de melhor ator dramático, que além de Cox e Harington incluía Tobias Menzies, de “The Crown”, e os já premiados Rami Malek ([“Mr. Robot”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2016/08/1799404-mr-robot-prende-espectador-na-paranoia-do-heroi-em-nova-temporada.shtml)) e Billy Porter (de “Pose”, talvez uma escolha mais justa).

 A [série da rainha Elizabeth 2ª](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/11/com-olivia-colman-no-elenco-realeza-britanica-parece-a-mafia-em-the-crown.shtml) inevitavelmente abocanhou o prêmio de melhor atriz dramática para Olivia Colman, que conquista seu terceiro troféu em quatro anos —no ano passado, ela levara o de atriz dramática em filme com “A Favorita”, no qual viveu outra rainha, e dois anos antes o de coadjuvante em série com a policial sisuda de “O Gerente da Noite”.

 Sem maior sobressalto nas escolhas, a noite marcou duas injustiças em termos de TV. 

 A primeira foi a não indicação de “Olhos que Condenam” (Netflix) como minissérie, embora a premiada [“Chernobyl”, da HBO, drama sobre o desastre nuclear soviético cheio de ecos políticos atuais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2019/06/chernobyl-chega-ao-fim-na-hbo-com-alerta-para-o-futuro.shtml), tenha sido das melhores coisas que a TV exibiu no ano passado.

 A segunda, a derrota do magnífico Jared Harris, protagonista de “Chernobyl”, para Russell Crowe entre os atores de minissérie. Ao menos seu colega de cena Stellan Skärsgard, que consegue imprimir emoções sutis e medo no burocrata Boris Shcherbina, levou uma merecida estatueta de coadjuvante para casa.",1

420,2020-01-06 13:41:06+00:00,"He's not wrong. Many people take pain medication for legitimate conditions; after a short while, thier bodies become dependant on the substance or they experience withdrawl symptoms. That doesn't make them addicted; if you have a legitimate condition, prescribed medication taken on time, as directed, under medical supervision- then you're not an addict. You're still physically dependant. 

There's a BIG difference between physical dependance and addiction; Addiction is the drive to misuse or abuse a substance that a person is taking for no legitimate medical purpose (this includes intentionally taking or overtaking a prescription that's given under false pretenses for an exaggeration or fully made-up ailment. Tricking a doctor into prescribing you something- doesn't make you ""not an addict"" to be clear.

  Addiction is taking more and more (to stay above the level necessary to get high)- with no regard for anything except chasing that feeling. It is 100% possible to by physically dependant and not addicted. 

I would know; I have ehlers-danlos syndrome and experience dozens of joint dislocations every day. My entire body is in agonizing pain, 24/7. I have been on the same dosage of extended release morphine for 8 years, with breakthrough medication (dilaudid) for times when I've had an acute injury and the ER morphine does not maintain my pain below a 5/6-10. I've never once taken a single dilaudid for ""fun"" and I've never experienced a high from my medication. I've never taken it more than directed, nor more often. I've never taken it without significantly higher pain levels, and I've never taken more than 3 breakthrough doses in 24 hours, because
A) that would be more than I've been prescribed/instructed
And
B) it diminishes the effectiveness of the 8mg dilaudid after just 2-3 doses anyway. If I continued taking it, it would do absolutely nothing but raise my body's tolerance, requiring more the next time. 

As a result, I've regularly turned over medication for destruction after several months when I had unused amounts leftover; 

And I've never once even considered that I could take ""a bunch"" to find out what it might be like to be high. I have zero interest or desire to be out of touch with my sober mind. I've had DNA testing that shows I'm a rapid metabolizer, so it may not even be possible for me to *get* high without a truly dangerously large amount of opiods; after my last spinal surgery they gave me 450mg of iv Fentynyl, at which point the out-of-control spasming  quieted, and I was able to eat a sandwich and discuss after-care plans. It had no effect on me cognitively, something even the nurses were surprised by. (Apparently at much lower doses they've had people nod off mid-sentence, or be ""loopy"" and drowsy. I've never experienced any of that.)

Anyway, I think it's very important to be clear on the difference between addiction and dependance because it exists; and one is a seriously life-destroying situation. The other, for many chronic pain sufferers, is little more than a known/expected side effect of thier medication.",2

**FLASHBACK 1897**


We flashback to 1897 when the young English boys who were searching for their lost dog in the cave. They hear barking in the cave but discover no dog. Instead they find a nun washed up and sprawled against the rocks in a cave. She's covered in blood from her chin down. She is moaning unintelligibly and between the odd word like ""Dracula"" and ""Vampire"" she lets out a bark or a growl.

She is brought to a hospice run by nuns to recuperate and its soon discovered she cannot stand the sunlight and will not eat food or drink water. She is passing in and out of consciousness.

**HOSPICE (NIGHT-TIME)**

Agatha wakes upright in the hospice overcome by a dry thirst that has left her unable to speak. It is dark except for stripes moonlight streaming into the ward through the tall windows. 

The patient next to her is wailing and writhing in her bed. He is begging for both morphene and death. 

Agatha's eyes turn red and bites the patient's neck, killing him. We hear the guttural growls of a predator eating its fill. 

She finishes feeding and she screams when she realises what she's done - a nun can be heard getting up to investigate. 

""You poor soul I'm coming.""


Agatha quickly grabs a crucifix from the wall and forces the blunt object, with only her hands, into her victim's chest. With almost as much difficulty removes the crucifix and attempts to kill herself.

The nun opens the door - we see the crucifix drop to the floor and hear the window smash.

So no matter which way you slice it if you want to remove private insurance all together like some candidates want then you are basically destroying a good percentage of the economy. This is why Yang's plan is much better. It seeks to reform the healthcare industry and lower the corruption in it, there by causing rates to go down and quality of care to go up.

This can happen by making it so that doctors are now on salary instead of getting paid for each service. This will make it so that doctors have less of an incentive to prescribe useless medicine and tests. Another way is also controlling the price of drugs like Oxycotin so that big pharma companies cant charge Americans a ridiculous amount for prescription medicine when it is prescribed.

Also over the time private healthcare sector would become smaller. If you expand the current Medicare by lowering the age and eligibility requirements overtime it will be a much more smoother and realistic way to give more Americans healthcare.

As for the comments on Biden, that's not Yang, so I fail to see how that affects him. Just because you are kind and courteous to someone doesn't mean that you become that person and associate with their actions.",1

The list is rather long but it includes several features meant to make liches long-term nemesis by incentivising players to not rush through liches (unlike the current system). 

Notable changes are the Intel system (a resource that replaces murmurs and that you spend to interact with your lich in various way), the ability to regain your stolen loot and steal the kuva weapon without permakilling the lich (resulting in the lich rerolling a different, better weapon), and the Assets system, where the lich acquires various stuff that makes your life difficult but that you can destroy for rewards. 

Also a more gradual levelling up/territorial expansion, a (relatively) small revamp of how requiem/murmurs work (more masterminding, less grind), and a bunch of other stuff. Most of it is in the FAQ tab of the game and in the text posts I made on r/warframe about a month back.

I've been a gamer for as long as I can remember. I'm 35 now and 3 years ago I herniated my L4/L5. Worst pain I've ever experienced in my life, no joke. Essentially unable to function properly for 2 weeks, couldn't even drive, was out of work during that time . Then once I could atleast drive, function and go back to work I still had months of pain. Specifically sciatic pain that shot down my entire left leg to my left foot. It was horrible for the first hour I was awake every day. No painkiller the doctor gave would help. I just had to ""tough it out"". The closest relief I ever had was when was prescribed oxyxodone but it only worked if I took a double dose, then it had me loopy and high as a kite for a couple hours. I didn't do that often becuase there was no way I wanted to become some prescription pill addict so I o ly did it when the pain was just too much to handle and I needed a break.

Today I'm probably 90% pain free at any given time but I'll occasionally still get quick sharp back pain if I move the wrong way that reminds me ""yo your back is fucked""

I try to make sure my posture is ok when sitting. The biggest issue I get is after long sessions there's pain kinda where my head and neck join. Once that starts I basically have to take a break and go walk around or do something else for a bit.

477,2020-01-02 18:04:42+00:00," Dizem que os números não mentem, mas eles podem dar uma bela enganada. Numa primeira olhada, a impressão é de que 2019 foi bom para Hollywood. Cerca de US$ 11,3 bilhões, ou R$ 45,5 bilhões, foram deixados nos cofres dos cinemas americanos, superando pelo quinto ano consecutivo a marca de US$ 11 bilhões (o recordista ainda é 2018, com US$ 11,89 bilhões, ou R$ 47,9 bilhões).

 No entanto, com uma espiada mais atenta é possível dizer que só há um estúdio fazendo festa com os resultados do ano que acabou de terminar: a Disney. A empresa emplacou nada menos que sete títulos entre as dez principais bilheterias do ano, uma supremacia que não encontra paralelo nas últimas cinco décadas —a própria Disney alcançou a marca de seis títulos em 2016. 

 Mais. As seis maiores bilheterias de 2019 são da Disney, graças, inclusive, ao recém-lançado [“Star ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/12/mesmo-enrugado-star-wars-ainda-preserva-certos-encantos.shtml)[Wars](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/12/mesmo-enrugado-star-wars-ainda-preserva-certos-encantos.shtml): A Ascensão [Skywalker](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/12/mesmo-enrugado-star-wars-ainda-preserva-certos-encantos.shtml)”. E [“Vingadores: Ultimato”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/04/vingadores-ultimato-e-o-filme-mais-chato-de-2019.shtml), o campeão da temporada, se tornou a segunda maior arrecadação de todos os tempos com seus US$ 858,3 milhões, ou R$ 3,4 bilhões, só nos Estados Unidos. Se não é monopólio, dá para dizer que a Disney tem, no mínimo, uma pequena oligarquia.

 Os intrusos no ranking foram [“Homem-Aranha: Longe de Casa”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/07/homem-aranha-retorna-turbinado-para-enfrentar-monstros-e-hormonios.shtml), da Sony (que acabou de perder o sexto lugar para “Star Wars”), e [“Coringa”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/10/coringa-mostra-crueldade-do-homem-de-gostar-de-rir-dos-outros.shtml) (nono) e [“It - Capítulo 2”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/09/segunda-parte-de-it-muda-de-intensidade-e-retorna-mais-pesada-e-violenta.shtml) (décimo), ambos da Warner. E vale lembrar que “Longe de Casa”, grande hit da Sony, tem um dedinho da Disney —um acordo de valor não revelado fez com que o herói aracnídeo se aproveitasse de todo o boom causado pelo tal Universo Cinemático Marvel. Sim, a Marvel é da Disney.

 Se tirarmos os filmes do estúdio do Mickey da equação, o ano não foi tão bom assim. Na verdade, foi temeroso. Várias apostas das principais casas de Hollywood naufragaram miseravelmente nos cinemas.

  Um dos grandes flops de 2019 foi [“X-Men: Fênix Negra”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/06/sophie-turner-a-sansa-de-got-deixa-a-desejar-como-fenix-negra.shtml), da Fox (também adquirida pela Disney, mas ainda no comando de suas operações na temporada que terminou). O filme de US$ 200 milhões, ou R$ 806 milhões, de orçamento arrecadou apenas US$ 65,8 milhões, ou R$ 265,2 milhões, o que deve deixar a franquia um tempinho na geladeira. E olha que tinha como protagonista Sophie Turner, no auge da popularidade como a Sansa Stark de [“Game of Thrones”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/05/game-of-thrones-triunfa-no-final-ao-abdicar-do-obvio-e-escolher-otimismo-e-realismo.shtml). Mas não havia dragão ou zumbi de gelo capaz de salvar “Fênix Negra”.

 Também da Fox, [“Alita”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/alita-anjo-de-combate-e-eletrizante-mas-podia-ser-menos-angelical.shtml) somou US$ 85,7 milhões, ou R$ 345,3 milhões, o que representa só metade de seu custo. Inspirado em um mangá, o longa de Robert Rodriguez tinha potencial para continuações. Não mais.  
 O principal sucesso da Fox no ano foi o postulante a prêmios [“Ford vs. Ferrari”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/11/ford-vs-ferrari-e-filme-a-moda-antiga-com-grandes-sequencias-de-corrida-automobilistica.shtml), com honestos US$ 106,6 milhões, ou R$ 429,6 milhões, o que o leva à 27ª bilheteria de 2019.

 Outra franquia enterrada até segunda ordem é a de [“Exterminador do Futuro”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/10/arnold-schwarzenegger-com-cabelos-brancos-revive-exterminador-do-futuro.shtml). Arnold Schwarzenegger não vai voltar. Seu [“Destino Sombrio”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/10/novo-exterminador-traz-schwarzenegger-de-volta-ao-melhor-papel-de-sua-vida.shtml), da Paramount, reuniu o produtor James Cameron e a atriz Linda Hamilton, e praticamente passou uma borracha em tudo que aconteceu na série desde “Exterminador 2”. 

 Não deu certo. Faturou US$ 62,1 milhões, ou R$ 250,2 milhões, um terço de seu dispendioso orçamento. James Cameron, de “Avatar” e “Titanic”, não é mais o rei do mundo. 

 Já a Sony viu ruir outra tentativa de reconstruir uma franquia bem-sucedida com a nova versão de [“As Panteras”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/11/gracas-a-elenco-as-panteras-se-safa-de-ser-cliche-de-espionagem.shtml). A produção até era modesta para os padrões hollywoodianos —custou só US$ 48 milhões, ou R$ 193,4 milhõe). Em tempos de MeToo, o filme se cercou de boas-intenções.

 O elenco jovem era liderado por Kristen Stewart e tudo parecia no lugar para uma longa vida nas telas. No entanto, o filme foi uma das principais decepções de 2019, com US$ 17,7 milhões, ou R$ 71,3 milhões.

 Também tem tragédia de Natal: [“Cats”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/12/fracasso-de-cats-nao-se-resolve-apenas-com-o-aperfeicoamento-de-efeitos-visuais.shtml), da Universal. Ser um dos grandes musicais da Broadway não ajudou. Com atores de prestígio e até Taylor Swift no elenco, o longa teve US$ 18,9 milhões, ou R$ 76,1 milhões, de faturamento, e não deve fazer mais de US$ 20 milhões, bem menos que seus US$ 95 milhões, ou R$ 382,2 milhões, de orçamento.

 Mas talvez o maior fracasso do ano tenha vindo do gênero animação (especialidade da Disney). [“Playmobil - O Filme”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/12/com-roteiro-mal-costurado-playmobil-o-filme-nao-transcende-a-propaganda.shtml) tentou seguir o sucesso das versões animadas da concorrente Lego. A produção europeia custou € 63 milhões, ou pouco mais de R$ 282,1 milhões. No mercado americano, a pequena STX entrou como parceira na distribuição; somou US$ 1 milhão, ou R$ 4 milhões. Saiu de cartaz em duas semanas.

 E a Disney tem algum fracasso no ano? Claro que tem. Pequenos. [“Dumbo”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/03/dumbo-une-estetica-de-tim-burton-com-certa-inocencia-da-disney.shtml) e [“Malévola: Dona do Mal”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/10/michelle-pfeiffer-e-cenas-de-batalhas-salvam-novo-malevola-da-sonolencia.shtml) deixaram nas bilheterias US$ 114,8 milhões, ou R$ 462,6 milhões, e US$ 113,3 milhões, ou R$ 456,6 milhões, respectivamente. O primeiro custou US$ 170 milhões; o segundo, uns US$ 185 milhões.

 Mas “Dumbo” estava em cartaz quase ao mesmo tempo que [“Capitã Marvel”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/03/capita-marvel-apresenta-heroina-de-poder-cosmico-em-aventura-arrebatadora.shtml); e um mês depois de “Malévola 2” já estreava [“Frozen 2”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/12/frozen-2-pode-ate-parecer-desnecessario-mas-cumpre-papel-de-conto-de-fadas-familiar.shtml). Ou seja, os pequenos fracassos foram rapidamente suplantados por ostensivos sucessos. 

 Apesar da supremacia, será difícil repetir o êxito na temporada que está começando, quando a Disney não parece ter fichas tão pesadas. Em 2020 não há “Star Wars” ou “Vingadores”, apenas o primeiro filme solo da Viúva Negra, novamente com Scarlett Johansson. “Os Eternos”, mais um do portfólio Marvel, terá de fazer muita força para alcançar os números de “Vingadores”.

 Já a principal refilmagem do estúdio a ser lançada é “Mulan”. Espera-se um bom resultado, mas a animação que a inspira não tem o mesmo apelo de [“O Rei Leão”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/07/o-rei-leao-se-torna-o-melhor-remake-da-disney-sem-reinventar-a-roda.shtml) ou [“Aladdin”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/05/novo-aladdin-vai-contra-o-que-consagrou-a-disney-como-estudio.shtml), hits do ano passado.

480,2020-01-02 14:56:41+00:00,"How much have you taken at once before? Oral, IV, snort, what ROA? What's your tolerance like right now? Does 30mg of oxy get u high or are they pressed with fent? You might want to try a larger dose of morph to enjoy it because I always thought the same thing when I'd try the 15's, 30's and 60's but eventually changed my mind when I ran across 60 200mg green MScontin's for $6 each. Sold a few for $25 each to get my money back and enjoyed the rest by taking 200-400mg at a time orally (don't do this, I had/have a large tolerance to dope/fent/methadone at the time). If you do try a larger dose, go slow 'cause you can always take more but you can't take less once you've taken it. 

If you use oxy for pain relief and a buzz, you could probably save some money by taking a smallish dose (30-60mg's) of MScontin orally with your oxy so you won't be snorting a roxy every 2-6 hours just to stay well. They mix well in my opinion and morph can be stimulating or sedating depending on how much you take. I like larger doses that make me nod out but smaller doses with oxy used to be stimulating to me. Morph SHOULD be cheap AF so I used to save money by doing this when oxy still did something for me. They work great for pain together too. 

My dose was 300 because 200 wasn't quite enough for me to nod and 400 would have me nodding too much and I wanted them to last as long as possible since it was so nice being high AF all day for $18 (at first, free after I got rid of a few). I never woke up sick so some days I'd wait a few hours to take 300mg's then I wouldn't even have to re-dose at night before bed so I'd only use 1 and a half on those days. 300 would have me nodding on and off from hour 2 to hour 10. They're supposed to last 12 hrs (which they do plus some IMO) but I wouldn't even be fiending for another one or looking at the clock every few minutes at the 12 hour mark like you do with oxycontin or any other ""12 hour"" extended release medicine or even ""72 hour"" fent patches. Hell, I'd be sick at 72 hours after putting a patch on but that's off topic and another story. 

Morph is so good in high doses (and it lasts so long) that I really wish you could get it at 'done clinics. I'd WAY rather have 300mg's of MScontin in the morning and 300mg's at night than getting 150mg's of methadone at the clinic. Hell, if they still make Avinza or whatever the 24 hour morphine pills were, I could probably take 500-600mg's a day in the morning at the clinic if that was an option.",1
481,2020-01-02 13:40:25+00:00,"It's always such a relief to read about the experiences of others and I was so pleased to read about yours - it makes me feel less isolated.

I'm approaching my later years now, and despite never breaking any law that I am aware of, have done exactly the same thing as you when my medication was stopped a couple of years ago and I would have continued to do so if things hadn't changed. 

My daughters, who know far more people than I in our local town, and who all work in admirable professional capacities and so aren't given to sitting around complaining, were so incensed at all the ridiculousness that they began seeking out people who would be able to help me. They paid the one time only, other than that the people they knew went literally hunting through their old medications in various boxes and cabinets. When my script was reinstated I saved what they'd managed to get for me in case it happens again.

We shouldn't have to live this way should we? When otherwise perfectly productive and contributing adults are resorting to paying for pain relief there is something radically amiss. I despise the fact that we are labelled, like you have been - 'pill seeker' indeed. There should be lawsuits appearing all over the place because it's absolutely fucking appalling. 

I want to know how they come to these seemingly random results - such as Oromorph has been proven not to work!!!! Who says? And their research means nothing to me anyway because, as far as I'm concerned, it DOES work - for me. 

What are they going to do with all the individuals such as you and I who are beginning to demand the right to live largely pain free? And the word 'live' encompasses so much, on so many levels doesn't it? It means a fulfilled life instead of becoming non-functional and increasingly depressed.",1

483,2020-01-02 12:46:08+00:00,"Same. And I do keep harping on about this but forgive me please, I'm getting old.

I function very well on the Morphine the medical profession put me on. I am in my early 60s, still working on a farm with horses, and outside in all weather's. I also help with the cattle, and spend much of the run up to Christmas being midwife to the maiden (first time mum's) Ewes as they give birth to their first babies. I can't do this if I don't have strong pain relief.

I have Fibromyalgia, Osteoporosis and Degenerative Disc Disease. I rarely ride my own horse anymore because of pain but that's ok, she's getting to be an old lady too and I believe we do have to accept that there are bound to be limits on what we can do as we age. 

The powers that be have been trying to cut my script and I keep fighting for the right to keep it at the level it's been at for about 2 years. 

My main argument is (and will be when I take it to the local health board) that, with luck, I have at most 20 years of actual life left. If Morphine, and the ridiculously small bottle of Oromorph they deign to reward me with every week, enables me to continue to have a quality of life working at something I've done all my life (since I was first plonked on the back of a horse in fact) then where is the logic in stopping my meds?

The alternative is that I stay in the house in my dressing gown and 'jamas - no point in bothering to get dressed  - in pain, with the curtains closed on yet another day I'm unable to take part in. This in turn will lead to a profound and permanent state of depression.

Despite what the research they keep throwing at me tells 'them', I don't need to take increasing amounts of Morphine, and despite the 'pain specialist' at my surgery telling me that 'it's been proven' Oromorph doesn't work, I am the one taking it and I disagree.

I am following the 'don't punish pain' movement closely because I don't think we have anything similar in the UK, and while I don't have the time or energy to start a movement of our own in conjunction with our cousins across the pond, if someone was to do so I'd make the time to join the fight. My personal one begins next week with my local health authority.

Sorry for the rant. It's a thing I feel very strongly about though, and I feel for all the others suffering along with me.",1

 Preso em Porto Alegre em 1970, ele deixou Goiânia, onde vive, para voltar à capital gaúcha pela primeira vez desde então. O retorno ocorreu no exato dia em que foi levado ao cárcere: 12 de dezembro.

 Diante do prédio onde funcionou o [Dops](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/hoje-pastor-ex-delegado-do-dops-vira-reu-acusado-de-queimar-corpos-na-ditadura.shtml) (órgão responsável pela repressão e tortura na ditadura militar), hoje sede da Polícia Civil gaúcha, Antônio diz não ter ódio.

 Foram nove anos de cárcere, os últimos em São Paulo, onde sofreu tortura comandada por [Carlos Alberto Brilhante ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/ustra-era-um-monstro-que-me-torturava-com-choque-e-ria-diz-vitima-de-militar.shtml)[Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/ustra-era-um-monstro-que-me-torturava-com-choque-e-ria-diz-vitima-de-militar.shtml), militar elogiado seguidas vezes pelo presidente Jair Bolsonaro. “A impunidade dos torturadores facilita que o herói dele seja o que me torturou da pior maneira possível”, disse.

 A militância de Pinheiro Salles iniciou no movimento estudantil. Participava de protestos e ações de universitários contra o regime militar e atuou no Polop (Organização Marxista Política Operária).

 Após o AI-5, passou a integrar a luta armada, passando pelo POC (Partido Operário Comunista) e, mais tarde, pelo MCR (Movimento Comunista Revolucionário), cujas ações se concentravam no Rio Grande do Sul.

  Natural de Jordânia (MG), o jornalista viveu e militou também na Bahia. É autor de “1964: Golpe e Ditadura” e “Ninguém Pode Se Calar”. A seguir, o depoimento dele à **Folha**.

      

 Sou jornalista e fui preso em 12 de dezembro de 1970, em Porto Alegre. Voltei à capital gaúcha 49 anos depois, em 12 de dezembro de 2019. Quase suspendi a visita na última hora, mas compreendi que era importante. Fiquei nove anos preso, sendo torturado. Depois do Rio Grande do Sul, fui mandado a São Paulo, de onde saí em 1979.

 Meu sequestro ocorreu durante a tarde, enquanto estava em uma rua do bairro Menino Deus. Fui levado para o antigo Dops, onde hoje funciona a Polícia Civil, que agora revejo. Muita gente passa em frente deste lugar sem saber o que acontecia aqui.

 Introduziram uma bucha de bombril no meu ânus enquanto estava pendurado no pau de arara. Junto da bucha, colocaram uma das pontas de um fio usado para dar choque. A outra extremidade do fio enrolaram no meu pênis.

 O choque é com a chamada “maricota”, instrumento de tortura que gera corrente elétrica com o movimento de uma manivela. A corrente ficava concentrada entre o ânus e o pênis. Quem comandava a tortura do Dops de Porto Alegre era o delegado Pedro Seelig.

 A tortura começou ainda do lado de fora. Trouxeram a gente, eu e o engenheiro Luis Carlos Dametto, nos pisoteando dentro da viatura. “Vão virar presunto”, gritavam. Vários outros carros apareceram e ligaram as serenes.

 Nos arrastaram do carro, nós dois algemados. “Vamos fazer o esquentamento aqui”, disseram. Fizeram uma roda de torturadores com chutes, pancada de cassetete, e nós no meio. Transeuntes pararam para ver, e eles deram tiros para o alto. “São terroristas”, berravam enquanto torturavam.

 Eu tinha um relógio muito bom, dado pelo meu pai. A violência quebrou a pulseira. “Meu relógio!”, eu consegui falar. O delegado ficou com o relógio. “É coisa de burguês, capitalista. Você é comunista, não pode ter um relógio desses”, ele disse. Nunca me devolveram. Até o cinto que eu usava quando fui preso vi um torturador usando, o inspetor Nilo Hervelha.

 Nos arrastaram até o elevador. Sentaram em cima de nós, dando soco na cara. Paramos em um andar que não sei qual é. O professor Índio Brum Vargas, que já estava preso, conta que me viu chegando arrastado com sangue escorrendo pelo nariz e boca. Separaram a gente, eu e o Dametto, amarraram venda nos olhos e me jogaram em um lugar.

 Comecei a escutar os gritos dos torturados. Alguém chegou no meu ouvido e disse: “Fica aí, putão, daqui a pouco chega a tua vez. Com você a gente tem calma, você vai virar presunto depois”. Arrancaram minha roupa e começou a tortura. Em pouco tempo, fiquei sem condições de caminhar. Era arrastado para sair da sala de tortura.

 A agressão aos órgãos genitais era uma coisa constante na ditadura. Nas mulheres cortavam os seios com alicates. A mãe de um companheiro ficou com a bexiga e o útero expostos. De uma maneira ou de outra, os órgãos sexuais são recantos privados, ligados à intimidade, vontades pessoais. A agressão direcionada era uma maneira de atacar isso. Tanto que a primeira coisa que faziam era tirar a roupa dos presos.

 Em Porto Alegre, além do Dops, passei pelo Presídio Central e pela chamada Ilha do Presídio, a Ilha das Pedras Brancas, no rio Guaíba. Fui também para a cadeia de Jacuí.

 Depois do Rio Grande do Sul, fui levado para São Paulo. Passei pelo DOI-Codi, onde Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra comandava as torturas, inclusive as que sofri lá. As pessoas se referem a mim como um sobrevivente, um mutilado. Me orgulho de ter sobrevivido porque nunca delatei ninguém.

 Perdi os dentes. Fiquei com as mandíbulas destruídas, que agora são próteses de platina. Fiquei surdo do ouvido direito e escuto parcialmente do esquerdo. Perdi parte do movimento do braço direito, meu pulso ficou completamente rasgado, passei por cirurgia de reconstrução.

 Nos últimos anos antes de ser solto, fiquei na prisão da Justiça Militar Federal de São Paulo. ­­­Em 1975, elaborei a pauta para desenvolver o documento coletivo que denunciava os nomes de 233 torturadores.

 Nas conversas, chamávamos de “bagulho”, para ninguém entender. Os torturadores não eram monstros sádicos, mas pessoas normais que faziam aquilo para o qual foram [preparadas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2012/11/1182605-como-a-ditadura-ensinou-tecnicas-de-tortura-a-guarda-rural-indigena.shtml) pelo Estado para fazer.

 O documento repercutiu muito. Nossa versão era que o dom Paulo Evaristo Arns levou embaixo da batina após uma visita. Mas não posso afirmar isso. Por mais difíceis que fossem as coisas, contávamos com elementos favoráveis à nossa causa entre os repressores.

 Em uma visita da Elô, mãe dos meus filhos Raphael e Clara, agrediram ela. “Solta ela! Não faça isso”, gritei. Acabei punido. A imprensa alternativa divulgou e, com a repercussão, recebi a vista dos atores Eva Wilma e Francisco Milani.

 Mostrei a eles uma carta que tinha e scrito para Elô. “Me lembra o Carlos Drummond”, o Milani disse. A Eva Wilma levou a carta na calcinha. Com ajuda do Mário Lago, a carta chegou ao Drummond. Ele escreveu uma crônica sobre isso.

 Fui preso por atuar contra a [ditadura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/clovisrossi/2019/03/a-ditadura-que-nao-houve-matou-423-pessoas-no-brasil.shtml) e participar da resistência armada assaltando bancos depois do [AI-5](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/11/nao-se-assustem-se-alguem-pedir-o-ai-5-diz-guedes.shtml). Fazíamos um discurso explicando nossa luta aos funcionários das agências, explicávamos que o seguro cobriria o prejuízo. Era a única maneira de combater.

 O que aconteceu nesse país, não digo de ouvir falar. Senti na carne, na alma. Testemunhei tudo que relato. Por mais que sejam relatos contundentes, não alcançam a exatidão, porque ninguém consegue descrever.

 O governo que está aí [defende que sequer aconteceu a ditadura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/nao-houve-ditadura-teve-uns-probleminhas-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-regime-militar-no-pais.shtml). A situação é desesperadora. Se tivesse acontecido punição aos torturadores, como ocorreu na Argentina e no Uruguai, permitindo que se fizesse justiça, o governo seria outro. A impunidade dos torturadores facilita que [o herói dele](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml) [Bolsonaro] seja o que me torturou da pior maneira possível [[Brilhante Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2015/10/1694254-morre-coronel-ustra-ex-chefe-do-doi-codi-durante-a-ditadura.shtml)].

 Não me arrependo absolutamente de nada. A violência, a truculência, os absurdos que aconteceram comigo poderiam ter acontecido, e aconteceram, com outras pessoas. Outros sofreram mais que eu.
