Com somente 8% da sua terra sendo produtiva no brasil, nós alimentamos quase 11% da população mundial (cerca de 800 milhões a 1 bilhão de pessoas, varia da pesquisa)

Quase TODOS os países de 'primeiro mundo' tem PELOMENOS 20, chegando a 45 ou mais % da sua area PRODUTIVA. O problema é que se o mundo permitisse o Brasil fazer isso, alimentariamos mais da metade do mundo inteiro. Por isso existe um lobby gigabtesco contra nós.

Sem contar que grande parte das terras produtivas aqui, que já são poucas, pertencem ao MST e movimentos terroristas derivados/similares, ou agricultura familiar. Esses movimentos e principalmente políticos que incentivam a reforma agrária são sempre queridos e financiados por agentes externos para manter o brasil pouco competitivo, pois quebrariamos qualquer outro país que vende muito agro.

E pra finalizar: o Agro abastesce com SOBRA o lercado interno. Aqui não falta comida, o que falta é dinheiro. O que não é culpa do Agro.",1

They managed to get a high up official in the FDA to issue an extraordinary claim that they put on stickers on all oxy bottles that it was a non addictive opioid. The reason Purdue Pharma done all this - they were about to lose the sole rights to the MScontin slow release delivery system so found another as yet unused opioid and simply made it in slow release form.

Your the one here supporting corporate fascists and gangsters buddy.

Whether it is Purdue Pharmaceuticals LLC bribing doctors to overprescribe Oxycotin (an opioid drug that is 10x more powerful than morphine) resulting in thousands been addicted, imprisoned or dead. None of the Sackler family who owned Purdue were ever held criminally liable despite been fined $8.8 billion.

These executives and corporations are not a benevolent force for good and they certainly do not care about your best interests or anyone else’s. 

They are profit-making organisations that solely exist to generate billions of pounds in profit for their shareholders and executives by any means possible. They viciously attack their critics on and offline and purchase entire governments to get away with their criminal conduct.

Doors shut in my face everything until a friend recommended a GP known for his open mindedness. Made an appointment.

You want me to prescribe you the drugs that it specifically says on your notes not to prescribe?"" And I thought for a second and said ""Yes that's correct. If I don't get stabilised I will be dead within the year."" I was a heavy IV heroin user. So he ponderd for a bit and said ""OK. I'll start you on 4 x30s and titrate you up to 240mg of dihydrocodeine and you're only gonna get 10mg of diazepam from me daily. Is that OK?"" And I coulda kissed him! There was a caveat. He added ""BUT if you report missing prescriptions, try to manipulate dose increases, report stolen medications or prescriptions then I'll stop you dead in the water without a taper"" and I agreed to that. There's other doctors I've since been made aware of who script MScontin for older addicts for whom methadone and subs didn't work.

O Imperador Hadriano era extremamente homossexual (as fontes gozavam com ele não querer saber minimamente da mulher) mas não gozavam com ele por isto (ele era um Heroi Militar da Revolta da Judeia p.e.) era ""aceite"" que ele dominasse outros ""homens/ rapazes"" (das figuras Romanas que temos mais figuras hoje é um dos seus ""amantes"", Antinous até porque foi deíficado).

69,2021-12-29 14:24:39+00:00,"Excellent find that.

I recently watched Dopesick and the case against Oxycotin centered around the claim that opioids were actually only addictive for under 1% of people.

The rabbit hole led to a long list of papers and medical articles using this figure with no apparent evidence as to where it came from. Those that did said it appeared in a study in the NEJM. Further on they dug until they found it was a single paragraph letter sent in by a doctor working in a hospital who came across some interesting results among a small batch of patients. It was essentially a thought bubble.

However that stat, from a man thinking out loud and calling for more research, became the main data point that allowed for the treatment of moderate pain with opioids, including Oxycotin.

The layers of apparent professional rubber stamps on top of that small letter meant that it became accepted as the norm.

It demonstrates the importance of the fundamentals but also how it will not be questioned as long as its profitable.

Another interesting part of the show was how they described those who still got pain after being on the drug. ""Breakthrough Pain"" they called it, and proscribed a higher dose as the solution. Exactly the same tactic now with mRNA vaxxes and breakthrough infections.",1
70,2021-12-29 13:51:12+00:00,"Speaking strictly IV and rush only there are morphinans that are likely even stronger than hydromorphone. They are impossible to obtain unless you have a dedicated chemist though. First of all there are other esters of morphine besides diacetylmorphine (heroin); those include for example dibutyrylmorphine, dipropanoylmorphine, dibenzoylmorphine etc. They work on the same principle as diacetyl, that is they quickly get through the blood-brain barrier and then turn into morphine. Some of them could be rushier than dilly but there are no reports on them.

Then there are also morphine derivatives that work on their own (=aren't biological precursors), the only one that appeared on the drug scene in the 21st century was desomorphine afaik. Deso should actually be very nice in its pure non-krokodil form. You also have some of the more potent morphine derivatives like 6-methylendihydrodesoxymorphine (80 times morphine) and N-phenethylmorphine (14 times morphine) and many other similar ""xy-morphines"".

Even more interesting are acetylated morphones, those are like oxymorphone and hydromorphone but should theoretically penetrate the blood-brain barrier faster, which would make them like extremely euphoric. It's for example the x,x-diacetyloxymorphones and acetylmorphone, which is more like acetylated hydromorphone.

There's also the metopon family, that's a huge one and i'd bet some of them are rushier than dilly. Bentley compounds (etorphine and the like) also gotta have some good ones.

Moving to fully synthetic non-morphinans there are fentanyl analogs that are reported to be better than dilly or better than heroin, i think butyrylfent and fluorofuranylfent were among them. U-47700 was also up there, supposedly it was like crack of opioids. There are also other U-compounds but mostly kappaergic.

What else, there is the holy trinity of dextromoramide, ketobemidone and dipipanone, those used to be super popular and reported to be the S tier rush-wise.

I'm sure there's more but these are the most likely i guess.",1

77,2021-12-29 09:48:25+00:00,"Let me make my situation more clear. It may make what I’m saying more understandable. Here is my history with opiates. 

I started experimenting in the year 2000 with Oxycontin and Xanax. Experimentation turned to mental addiction rather quickly (a few weeks). That turned into physical addiction within another month, which I was in denial of. The price of Heroin paled in comparison to the price of Oxycontin and there was really no choice. Pay a ridiculous amount more or just buy heroin (which wasn't much more euphoric to be honest, but was financially manageable and led me to be able to stop playing script ""games"" which were getting very legally ""sketchy"".

During this time of starting to switch to heroin but still using IR oxycontin and dilaudid (with Xanax the whole time). I had tried IV but it was very very taboo for someone of my “stature” so despite how nice it was, I avoided it. Around this time I still considered myself dabbling despite the retrospective serious addiction I already had.

I was already selling “party drugs” in the suburbs in my teen years. As I graduated high school, the amounts of selling I was doing was starting to increase. I was starting to a lot of it to support my own habit and also have the ability to drive a nice car, have a nice small home (three bedroom two bath) that I was renting to own, as well as a bunch of small assets. I was selling MDMA mainly because I met someone after an arrest during a 3 month stint in county jail and was now accessing it for $.80cent a pill if I purchased 1000 of them. This was during a time when they were going for anywhere from $15-$20 a piece downtown Atlanta. So basically I developed plugs within the inner city at a very young age. I'm white as casper. Not a good recipe. 

Eventually I was purchasing 60,000-70,000 tabs a month and had absolutely no idea how deep in over my head I was. I understood that if caught by law enforcement that I would do a LOT of time but didn’t understand exactly what I would have been looking at. I realized it was dangerous and serious and even owned and carried a pistol but didn't understand how little respect many people had for life and how jealous some people were. Many on this level were regularly wearing bullet resistant vests and I was young and naive and thought it was for show. Life was great for a while. 

In December of 2007 I had a childhood friend who had been working for me who had gotten severely addicted to heroin (I had absolutely no idea to what extent or we would have never been working together). He ended up taking a front and never paying me. It added up to about $2k. I charged it to the game and didn’t even call him back. He called me 8 months later with a sob story and offered a somewhat believable explanation for why I wasn’t paid. He was then telling me that he was back on his feet, offered to cover his debt, and then asked not for a front but to buy 6,500 beans and if i could front another 3,500 if he could cover 6,500. I stupidly agreed.

Ok I'm rambling. To make a long story short, he set me up by a jack boy crew. One of them in particular was an evil guy. I called my friend and told him I was at the meet place. Less than two minutes later I was approached by a guy with a red bandanna wrapped around his face and a beanie on, pointing a .45 at my head and demanding i give him my car, money, drugs, and girlfriend. That wasn't happening so I attempted to take off and was shot in the process in my back. It went through my lungs and spinal cord. This caused a bad car accident, followed by the shooter running through my pockets while I lay basically in the process of dying (after my girl had taken off w everything when I gave it to her and told her to run).

I managed to live but am a paraplegic from mid chest down. This changes how I will experience many opioids as opposed to most people. At this point I entered a point where I didn’t care anymore and started heavily IV’ing fentanyl and taking massive amounts of Xanax. I would even mix GHB at times. This led to seven overdoses (two of which landed me in the ICU).  

In essence, my point is that someone who has 18+ years of opiate experience, a couple with foxy, 7 of that with heroin and 9 with fentanyl when the user is paralyzed from mid chest down, they maybe effected differently from others. 

However, I know many, many, many fentanyl users who crave that warm intense euphoria they claim fentanyl provides (however short the high) so bad that they will do nearly anything for it. Are you opiate tolerant? Like if you don't use will you get sick? Is it possible that what you had or was told was fentanyl was watered down garbage or not fentany at all? I haven't met many people at all who actually love opiates who say fentanyl isn't euphoric...",1

81,2021-12-29 05:27:14+00:00,"&gt;In part because of a pledge made to Israel to maintain their military superiority in the region. So there are legal impediments to selling them the most advanced military tech. But they gotten AWACS, all sorts of anti-tank missiles, and various armaments for their F-16s.

So Saudi Arabia isn't as big of an ally as you think if all they can get are fighter jets that first came out half a century ago. Israel is more important. 

&gt;But hey, maybe they too should be butchered by authoritarian hit men. As long as the hitmen are from a friendly country like Saudi Arabia and not China.

I guess the death of one green card holder takes a back seat to the destablization of the South China Seas, threatening of US allies, theft of 500 billion dollars in intellectual property every year, death of CIA informants, imprisonment of business leaders, indirect death of hundreds of thousands from fentayl and COVID every year, etc.

&gt;How many Uighurs have been killed by China's top leaders?

I'm sure no Falun Gong members and no Uighurs have been personally killed by China's top leaders. Just like Jamal Khashoggi was not personally killed by MBS.

&gt;Man, China's responsible for our failure in the drug war too? Here I was thinking that Americans were responsible for what they put in their bodies. Now I realize that it's entirely the fault of the manufacturer. Hey, I bet that applies to American gun manufacturers too, right?

Do American gun manufacturers evade US laws and smuggles guns while mislabeling them as something else to avoid detection? Nope. Because that's what happens with Chinese fentayl.

Well, let's give China a pass for mass smuggling fentayl into the USA under false pretenses and false labels. That COVID coverup and current vaccination misinformation that caused many deaths in the USA is directly the result of CCP leadership.

&gt;COVID can be cured, according to a video retweeted by our former President. Did China make him say that?

Trump being an idiot a year ago does not excuse today's Chinese propaganda agencies spreading vaccine information conspiracies that will contribute to hundreds of thousands of more deaths in the USA. Trump being an idiot also does not excuse the CCP for covering up and lying about COVID in its early stages.

Didn't you just say something about not using whataboutism in our other discussion?

&gt;So who incarcerates more people, China or America? It must be noted that China is 4 times more populous than America. Do they incarcerate more people than us?

Isn't this whataboutism, and we both criticized whataboutism in the other discussion?

China's actions of putting people in prison for their culture and religion is completely different from and much worse than the USA's actions of using disproportionately harsher sentence for minorities who are still actually committing a crime. 

&gt;They were loitering and China is tough on crime. Broken windows and all that.

What were you saying about incareration rates?

If the Chinese government was running US criminal policy, the USA would have 10x more people in prison. Many of the US convicts are drug convicts - who would have recieved death sentences in CHina. 

Either way, loitering does not make someone an extremist or terrorist....which is the offical justification of the CCP. And how do you arrest so many people for loitering to need to build so many mass internment camps?

&gt;Is it legal to teach grade school in Spanish in Arizona? What's this ""English-only"" law I see on the books?

Anybody can teach Spanish in the USA. And they do teach Spanish in govt funded US schools under foreign languages. There are no laws banning informal or formal teaching of Spanish.

And there is a huge difference in not having government funded classes vs not allowing even informal classes of a language to be taught.",1

1. SSRI, make it near impossible to cum
2. Opioids. Increase your round time 1-2 hrs at a (very) low dose. For example Tramadol,50mg 2hours before. Or 5mg Oxycodon. Obviously those are strong drugs but I believe using such a low dose once a week is not going to do much damage if you are a responsible person.  Try it out once without a lady so if you get nausea from them you don’t find out when it’s too late.
3. start with slower penetration speed, not too slow though, and increase as time passes. Don’t start out with 100% power.
4. Alcohol in moderate doses also increases my durability.
5. Dopamine agonists like caber can make you fuck multiple rounds without any break inbetween. I don’t recommend it though, using dopamine agonists wrong can lead to really bad problems that might stay with you for YEARS.
6. have sex more regularly. If I have sex every day I can control my orgasm much better after a few days. But once every 2 weeks with nofap… yeah not much to control here.

I guess if it’s a small decrease in effectiveness it’s not a big deal just another way of pharma trying to make its money like usual. 

I know the non abuse is available in other countries and that there uses to be a 160mg OxyContin but no longer. I’ve heard from users on Reddit in countries where the non abuse is available they specifically choose it because it works better for pain relief.  Not sure the validity to it I wouldn’t trust any research on it with our opioid phobic society and bias and anecdotal stories on Reddit are by no means a good source. 

I read it takes about 30 minutes to an hour for er opioids like mscontin to work but I have no personal experience with it the only long acting opioid I’ve been on is the fentanyl patch.

What's the safety margin and why is it too narrow, and what drugs does that compare to. 

As a reference I use Acetaminophen occasionally for pain management and never had had issues, but have had bad experiences with other OTC pain relief, particularly NSAIDs and my doctor's always recommend it, so it's a drug that benefits me and there wouldn't be other OTC alternatives to me.

124,2021-12-27 19:18:30+00:00,"So ziemlich ab der ersten Dosis soll also auch nur annähernd dasselbe sein wie weniger als jeder Vierte? Kann ich auch sagen Zigaretten und Alkohol machen so ziemlich ab der ersten Dosis abhängig. Ob 10% oder 60% scheint für dich ja alles ""so ziemlich ab der ersten Dosis"" zu sein.

&gt; 25% aller Erstkonsumenten werden süchtig nach einer Woche.

Wo nimmst du das denn plötzlich her?

&gt; Nikotin hat unmengen von Lungenkrebs und andere Lungenkrankheiten hervorgerufen, der Schaden am Gesundheitssystem zb 1998 in der Schweiz:

Tabak, nicht Nikotin. Abgesehen davon: Organerkrankungen die es bei reinem Heroin nicht gäbe. Wir haben also festgestellt, dass Tabak deutlich süchtiger macht. 60 % der Konsumenten vs 25 % bei Heroin. Wir haben festgestellt dass der Tabakkonsum selbst mit schwerwiegenden Erkrankungen wie Krebs, Lungenschäden, Durchblutungsstörungen und einem erhöhtem Risiko für Herz Kreislauf Erkrankungen einhergeht. Wir haben festgestellt bzw. nicht widerlegt, dass Heroin für die Organe nicht toxisch ist. Langzeitschäden momentan sind wohl Verstopfungen und ggf. schneller Krampfanfälle wobei wir das nicht wissen.

Jetzt erklär mir nochmal, wieso Heroin welches weniger süchtig macht und weniger schäden verursacht zu 100 mal mehr Schäden führt?

&gt; Ich schau in die USA und sehe schon weitaus mehr Schaden als durch Nikotin. 

Mit Verlaub ist das ein ziemlich beschissener Vergleich. Woran siehst du das denn? Weil es präsenter ist wenn ein Junkie auf der Straße verreckt als wenn der Oberstudienrat an Lungenkrebs im Krankenhaus stirbt?

In den USA sterben durch Überdosen mit Opioiden (und dazu zählt auch Fentanyl und der ganze andere kack) jährlich rund 49.000 Personen. An Folgen des Tabakkonsums sterben geschätzt 480.000 Personen in den USA. Ist kein fairer Vergleich aber mal als Beispiel. Davon abgesehen ist der Vergleich eben unsinnig weil er ganz andere Bedingungen hat. Tabak ist dort legal, Heroin nicht. Um das mal zu veranschaulichen:

Allein die Dekriminalisierung in Portugal hat Überdosis Tode um 80% reduziert. Wenn wir jetzt davon ausgehen, dass dasselbe für die USA gelten würde, dann würdest du z.B. mit 5fach zu hohen Überdosis Zahlen rechnen weil du dich auf die Situation der jetzigen Prohibition beziehst.

Das andere habe ich dazu auch schon erklärt: Die Situation in den USA ist durch die Pharmaindustrie herbeigeführt worden und nicht ein Ergebnis von Freizeitkonsum. Die hohe Anzahl an Überdosen dort ist ein direktes Ergebnis der Prohibition, da die Wirkstoffgehalte manchmal 3 % und manchmal 15 % sind. Wenn deine Dosis plötzlich das vierfache an Heroin drin hat ist das eben vorprogrammiert. Überdosen geschehen extrem häufig durch Fentanyl. Auch ein Ergebnis der Prohibition.

Der Vergleich ist eben absolut hinfällig.

&gt; Sucht ist sucht und egal ob man den Patienten sagt, es macht nicht abhängig zeigt doch eher wie ein Konsument bei legalen Opiate auch reinfallen wird.

Reinfallen worauf? Jetzt mal ganz konkret: Ich erzähle 100 Leuten ihre Ibuprofen-Ersatz nach der OP mache nicht abhängig, sei sicher und gebe ihnen Pillen mit. Ups, war Heroin, macht doch abhängig. Und das ist deiner Meinung nach ernsthaft damit vergleichbar, als wenn ich 100 Leute über die Gefahren und das Suchtpotential von Heroin aufkläre und erkläre, dass man es in Apotheken legal kaufen kann? 

&gt; Alle wissen, dass Rauchen süchtig macht, gibt aber immer noch genug neue Raucher.

Seit wir angefangen haben mehr Aufklärung zu betreiben hat sich das massiv verändert. Die Anzahl der 18-25 Jährigen die noch nie geraucht haben hat sich z.B. vervierfacht. Die Anzahl der Rauchenenden in dieser Altersgruppe ist von über 60% auf unter 25% gesunken. Natürlich konsumieren Leute weiterhin. Du gehst aber automatisch davon aus, eine Legalisierung würde zu viel mehr Konsumenten führen. Wie kommts, dass das in Kanada mit der gras Legalisierung z.B. nicht der Fall war?

&gt; Wir haben genug Methadon Zentren wo man sich das mit sauberem Besteck reines Produkt spritzen kann. 

Sorry, aber da merkt man wieder dass du vom Thema keine Ahnung hast. Nein, das geht nicht so einfach. Du musst vorher zum Arzt. Du brauchst vorher eine Umfangreiche Diagnostik inklusive Blutuntersuchungen, Urinuntersuchungen etc.

Du darfst keinen Beikonsum anderer Drogen haben in der Regel. Ziel ist oft die Abstinenz und wenn du nicht abstinent werden willst wirst du z.T. abgelehnt. 

Du bist im medizinischen System was auch einige nicht wollen. Nicht alle Konsumenten leben auf der Straße, du hast auch einige Professoren die Heroin konsumieren.

Und davon abgesehen: Methadon ist nicht dasselbe. In dieser Studie wurde z.B. eine Methadon Substitution mit einer Substitution mit reinem Heroin verglichen

doi:10.1192/bjp.bp.106.026112

Die reine Heroinsubstitution hat zu besseres Ergebnissen bei Gesundheit und sozialem geführt.

Momentan kannst du in Niedersachsen z.B. dir in genau einer Einrichtung dein eigenes Heroin selbst spritzen. Ansonsten gibt es hier maximal Spritzenautomaten u.ä.. Das reicht oft nicht, Spritzen sind ja nicht das einzige was man braucht und was wichtig wäre.

&gt; Ein Nikotinabhängiger ist noch Arbeitsfähig, bei Opiate wird es irgendwann nicht mehr gehen.

Das stimmt so pauschal nicht. Viele die Opiatabhängig sind arbeiten nebenbei., Das sind die klassischen Schmerzmittelabhängigen, genau das siehst du aber auch in der Methadon oder Diamorphin Behandlung. 

Die großen Probleme die mit Heroin verbunden sind entstehen durch unsauberen Konsum, Streckmittel und die soziale Situation. Obdachlosigkeit ist z.B. furchtbar für deine Gesundheit. Doof nur, wenn du wegen Beschaffungskriminalität obdachlos wirst.",1

126,2021-12-27 17:13:45+00:00,"It looks like Pit Girl (horizontal line, head / spikes above and hook) is in relation to a cult or occult practices. 

The cabin definitely feels like a place where people who want to go on super fun vision quests would go. Why’d the rocking chair guest blow their brains out?(also, they yeeted that shit out of the attic so fast…and had time to sweep up a whole mummified corpse?!) if not having seen things or done or experienced things that a person should endure alone?

People getting stuck/lost out there, foraging for however long before going insane, puzzling over everything. If there is that “the forest wants you to stay” element with the haunting and magnetic polarity (hence their plane going down and the cabin plane being grounded) then it’s possible that’s an angle being aimed for. 

There’s a low number of them right? Some girls died on the plane some we’re assuming will die but they’re currently a group which stands to reason that they’ll operate like that and stave off whatever we’ve been conditioned to assume is to come. They won’t go Attic Man crazy and hole up in an attic with a bad haircut. To get there though…takes some needling. 

It’s Lottie with her visions, it’s Misty with her drugs (hi Fentenyl Chocolates) it’s staying in one place for extended periods of time without planning. You have Tai, Lottie and Misty vying to be the most logical leader and idea outcome. Maybe Jackie since she’s still floating around. The embodied push and pull of so many voices already being heard (outside of poor precious bb Lottie) creating an environment that prepares you for the inevitable because it all seems to make sense. It’s unavoidable. 

Lottie there’s a pattern
Tai We have to go we’re going to die here 
Misty saves the world 
Jackie I hate it here. 

Enough of a bad shit sandwich to create a perfect breeding ground to fuel undecided people’s fears. 

Ascribing some importance to Pit Girl and justifying everyone’s pov (Lottie’s vision, Tai’s survival instinct, Misty’s quest, Jackie’s passive aggressive leadership) plus whole chomping on bad berries and mushrooms for instance - before your friends - gives a barrier between who you were, who you are, who you’re becoming and who you will be. 


Someone said they’re all AQ at one point. 

Disassociate from it all and become Wolf Girl  - you put on the ceremonial pelt and are that animal - and consider falling into the cult/occult practice of sacrifice for survival. There’s a crutch for it which is why so much of ep7 talks about what they did and for who. It wasn’t them, not the way everyone has been seeing them. 

Dunno if anyone caught that Shauna’s got a thing for butterflies - most of her adult t-shirt choices have butterflies and while in the forest wears a few. Nat refers to her rage as a tiger, Jackie a rabbit, Tai a wolf, Misty a bear. Maybe we will maybe we won’t see who AQ is, maybe it’s no one we’ve met thus far but it’s interesting to think of the transformation Shauna has gone through in comparison to the rest of the team.

Sold for $7k in October 2019. I'm not sure why this reference is sometimes called 3065 and sometimes 3159; if anyone knows any difference between the two let me know. The retailer that sold this is now called ""Mappin &amp; Webb"" (owned by Watches of Switzerland) and is still in business. Click here for [more Rolex dials co-branded by retailers](https://www.rolexforums.com/showthread.php?t=628739).

Many so-called ""California dials"" (half Roman numerals, half Arabic numerals) are just custom repaint jobs, but Rolex did indeed make a good amount of factory California dials back in the day. Rolex's [official name for this dial was ""error-proof dial""](https://i.imgur.com/8gM1lvm.png) and they actually [got a patent for it in 1942](https://i.imgur.com/J67LOsN.png)! My opinion is that California dials all originally came with Mercedes hands.

Rolex's revolutionary waterproof Oyster watches debuted in 1926, but they were all manual-wind at first. When they added an automatic winding rotor about 5 years later to make the Oyster Perpetual, the casebacks had to allow for the extra necessary room. This is why early OP's (1931-1953ish) have curved backs and are nicknamed ""Bubblebacks."" Italian collectors call them ""ovettone"" (""little egg""). Matte18 wrote a [great post that coherently describes the kinds of Bubblebacks](http://archive.is/Au9tX). 34mm models at the end of that era are known as ""ovetto"" (""big egg"") or ""Big Bubbleback"" models.

My dad passed away in October 2020 after struggling for life for a month in the hostital. He was in severe pain and had to be put on morphene. He passed away in the ICU with my mother standing beside him. I had to take a flight on half a day notice from Dublin, Ireland to New Delhi, India to see him one last time. Covid was wave one was going on during that time in Ireland and India. Six months after dad passed away, April 2021, mum got covid  during the second wave of covid in India which was very deadly. I'm sure everyone must be aware of the condition of India during that time. India was running low on vaccines. There was no Oxygen, no ICU beds anywhere. We were lucky enought to find an ICU bed for her somehow in such a chaos. Mum had gotten her first jab of vaccing only a week before she got infected. Doctors were not able to save her and she died in the ICU. We were not able to see her, nor were we able to give her a proper funeral.

I have a younger brother 25M. I was a complete mess, felt hopeless and and for a short moment thought of ending my life. Then my boyfriend flew all the way from US to Delhi. He and his family started coming to my house everyday with food. They helped us with the insurance stuff. Being surrounded with people who genuinely care makes a lot of difference. In my case I started to feel a little better. Then me and my brother started seeing a psychiatrist and a shrink. Found out I was bipolar. Started with the pills. Talking to the shrink once a week makes me feel relaxed. This might help you as well.  Six months after mum's death, around October 2021 I started getting back my will to live and I started making plans for my future, both professional and personal.

I want to add, if you’re about to take a pill you haven’t taken before don’t just take your mates word that it’s okay. A lot of young people have died, especially young women, as tolerance is different for everyone. Also the press on these pills isn’t exact, you could be getting a fairly potent one.
Best thing is to always test your drugs. You can buy test kits online completely legally. (You can also ask the local law and they’ll test it but they probably won’t give it back).
If you can’t test it, go on pill report and try find reviews. Then take 1/4 or 1/2 the pill to start. Honestly if you’re a small woman you should definitely start with 1/4.

I've worked retail almost three years before going to hospital. Pharmacies can refuse Goodrx for CII prescriptions. However, not all pharmacies can reject discount cards on controls per contracts.

In some states they may require it let on your insurance or that particular, Texas, Oklahoma, qns New Mexico do not. Try again.

 If my old Albertsons store or TomThumb had a cheaper price on Norco or Adderall, we had to accept them per the district manager. Even if their insurance paid and they had a co-pay,  I can gladly give you their number. She will tell you the same thing. 

Some examples:

https://insiderx.com/drugs/hydrocodone-bitartrate-er/prices

I believe in rehab, just not what we have now. I think they should help you want to stay sober and clean, help you become a more full version of you. Kinda what we see in Bojack Horseman. Most rehabs, like the friend mine went to, aren’t like that, and instead supplement your addiction. She was addicted to fentanyl and they gave her oxycotin to “squelch” it. It only made her addicted to oxycotin, and it made her feel like she was never going to be sober. Amazingly, weed doesn’t do that for her. Furthers my belief that its illegality is unjustified. I believe the illegality of psychedelics is unjustified, too. Federally, anyway. The states should be the deciders for themselves

The way our government is currently running, it’s one size fits all. It was, at one point, that the states held much power for themselves. It may have been a result of the civil war that they don’t. While i believe we needed to force human rights, we don’t need to force emotional rights, which is now what our government is doing. I’m autistic, but i don’t believe there should be laws regarding autism specifically. I think that wherever i work should keep that in account when addressing me, but i shouldn’t be able to just get away with being an asshole or pervert (i actually was falsely accused of sexual harassment at my work place, and a lot of my coworkers are pissed that I’m suspended, according to my friend-coworker. It’s been weighing on my self esteem a bit). 

I am a constitutionalist, and i believe our constitution delegated more power to the states on petty issues than the federal government. I believe states should be able to do their own trade, and i’d even encourage it. It’s already somewhat a thing, but if each state did more direct trading, it would greatly benefit everyone. 

The reason we have a Republic is solely because of our size. I believe voting should be done differently, tho. County executives count their votes, state executives count the county votes, the candidate with the most county votes wins the state, the candidate with the most state votes wins the election. Very basic system that’s rooted in the idea of individuals voting. It makes way more sense than this electoral college bullshit.",1

He has been addicted to opioids, and though I knew he was going through it, I had no idea that he had transitioned to heroin. He told me that story because I asked him why anyone would do fentanyl, why anyone would add it to anything if it were so dangerous. I'll tell you what he told me:

When I was on the blues (oxyconton + hydrocodone I believe, he got these from a cancer patient who didn't want them), it started almost harmlessly. I've always liked drugs, and I've always sold drugs, but usually I kept those two things separate. But everyone LOVED the blue, they couldn't get enough.  Then, my guy ran out (died) and I no longer had access to my supply. When I looked around to find some more, and noone had any, a person I know was like 'just try H, it's like the same thing.' I didn't, and to me, it sort of was the same thing. A euphoric high that matched my tolerance, and frankly it didn't matter where that feeling came from as long as I could have it. I was on heroin for a few months before my ex gf found me not breathing and literally saved my life, then saved my life again as she forced me through rehab. 
The reason I'm telling you this story, dk, is because chasing a high is the real reason people cut shit with fentanyl. It's a powerhouse, a monster of a drug. A little goes a long way, and suddenly my shit is better than the other guy's. Addicts like me will do anything to find that feeling again. 
Btw, that's where methadone and clinics come into play. Also don't shoot up before getting your methadone dose... It might kill you, or so I hear""

226,2021-12-23 15:13:24+00:00,"&gt;This also means that if you take heroin and then buprenorphine, it will rip the heroin out of your receptors sending you into precipitated withdrawal.

People do IV Suboxone (Yes, suboxone WITH the naloxone), it happens A LOT (Believe me, sadly when you are in addiction logic doesn't come into play much). Buprenorphine itself DOES NOTHING to help with other opiates. Please google Suboxone VS Subutex (Subutex is literally just the brand name for JUST Buprenorphine. Subutex is JUST THE BUPREHNORPHINE. Buprenorphine (By itself) ONLY helps with withdrawal symptoms because it itself is an opiate, only when combined WITH the naloxone does that make it Suboxone, which can cause precipitated withdrawal, etc. DUE TO THE NALOXONE. Notice how the word Bupren-orphine has ""-orphine"" in it? Similar to ""Morphine""?

Please Google and research any of this, I am not making it up or being rude and mean - I just REALLY want people to be educated on this, I hate misinformation and if it can save a life, that is even more of a plus.

From Google, again: ""While Suboxone can be a helpful component of an opioid treatment program, it does have the potential for abuse. The naloxone contained in this medication is supposed to prevent its abuse, but the makers of Suboxone do warn misuse is possible. The makers of this drug caution that physical dependence can occur with the use of Suboxone, as can psychological addiction. It’s also possible to overdose on Suboxone, **although it’s less common than if a person uses just buprenorphine alone.""**",1

If you still don't feel much I would repeat the same process till about max. 45mg for your first time. I don't think it would be unsafe to take more than 45mg on a given night but since it's your first time you might fall asleep or something. Also I have found that taking more that 40mg at a time increases side effects like itching, while not increasing euphoria. Again, please make sure that it's actually oxycodon. I personally like to put oxycodon in sprite. That way you slowly get more high instead of take a larger dosage at once.",1
230,2021-12-23 07:12:14+00:00,"Wanna dm we can go into more specifics easier there! :)

To answer your question I’m going to use mme but remember mme is flawed. An easy example is one metabolite of oxycodone is oxymorphine (which you can get desperately) which is much more potent than regular oxy and your pain relief from oxy depends on how much oxymorphine from oxy you metabolize. 

100mcg/hr fentanyl patch would be 240mme a day. 200mg mscontin every 3 hours would be 600mg since morphine (and also hydrocodone) is a direct 1:1 conversion mme wise. 300mg oxy since oxy is 1.5mme per mg would be 450mme. So based on this the MS Contin is the strongest and therefore provide the most relief. 

I’m shocked you’re getting these dosages but I’m happy their trying to take care of your pain! I hope you keep some narcan on hand and you and everyone you live with know how to use it though and probably invest in an oxygen monitor. I’d also keep narcan on you and if there’s any friends you go to regularly teach them how to use narcan. There’s a good YouTube video on how to use narcan and what to do with an opioid od I can share. Good luck and stay safe and relatively pain free!",1
231,2021-12-23 07:06:45+00:00,"I do with my fentanyl patch but that lasts through the night. I do notice it but not a ton but it lowers my baseline pain but it’s pretty strong. It’s 60hydro worth a day. When I was taking 10mg hydro er twice a day I noticed nothing. What long acting med (I assume opioid) are you taking and at what dose and frequency? What short acting med and at what dose and frequency do you take that?

You essentially have to triple the short acting opioid (long acting act for 12 hours so 4 hours x 3 = 12) for equivalent and often better pain relief but it’s rare they do that. Also a lot of people only get 8 hours out of the common long er opioids like OxyContin and mscontin so those may need to be prescribed every 3 days. 

I would guess you’re getting a low dose er opioid and that’s why you don’t notice it but I can’t know until you answer my questions above.

234,2021-12-23 04:26:47+00:00,"I’d say the fentanyl patch has a stronger perception in the medical community. I’ve had 2 pain doctors tell me the fentanyl patch I’m prescribed “is cancer level type stuff” pretty much word for word even though I was at the lowest dose fentanyl patch which did get increased to 25mcg/hr the second lowest. The thing is the fentanyl patch gets really strong really quickly. Goes from 28.8mg hydro worth to 60mg hydro worth to 90mg 120mg to 180mg to 240mg and beyond that you’d have to use a combination of multiple patches. The patches come in 12mcg/hr 25mcg/hr 37.5mcg/hr (not very common) 50mcg/hr 75mcg/hr and 100mcg/hr. 

MS Contin comes in increases of about 5mg worth and since it’s morphine 1mg increase of mscontin is about equivalent to 1mg hydro. So it’s a lot more flexible dosing wise.",1

Now you try to appeal to the authority of the tape. Much better authority in theory when it's say a man clearly shooting people or a person trying to kill them, , but in this video it's highly unclear.  Otherwise you'd have used the video as your *first* piece of evidence, damn what the coroners say. But you didn't, you went directly to their authority, which I showed exactly why it needs to be questioned. 

So now you have a video of a druggie being laid on the ground per his request, a cop who certainly didn't know wtf to do with that, handled it poorly, and ended up being convicted of literal murder when that man would never have died had he not taken a literal overdosed amount of fentenyl.

Reversal only ""fixes"" the issue -- or in other words makes you pain free -- about 50% of the time. About 20% are not substantially helped by reversal. A small percent get worse after reversal.

Your results may vary. Sometimes the ""fix"" is to remove your testicles. Sometimes that doesn't work. I have several examples of men who committed suicide from the pain, or overdosed on morphene. So that is definitely not fixable.

Mucha gente conoce la historia de Luca, a esta altura podemos decir que hay mas gente que la conoce que los que no la conocen, Luca nacio en una familia adinerada de Italia, estudio en el colegio Gordonstoun de Escocia, un internado donde iban las familias mas adineradas. Fue compañero del principe Charles (heredero al trono de la corona Inglesa), es decir, tenia una educacion y oportunidades en la vida que nadie tiene. Era el verdadero 1% del 1%. Despues le pinto la loca, y se fue a Inglaterra a inyectarse heroina y robar vinilos de la tienda donde trabajaba, donde conocio a bob dylan, the beatles, etc. Que fueron su influencia musical. Es tanta la educacion que tuvo Luca, que en un tema podemos encontrar referencias a Samuel Taylor Coleridge (A lo Borges, que le gustaba mucho coleridge) y puede pasar totalmente desapercibido. Luca crecio leyendo la crema de la crema de la literatura y poesia inglesa, a William Blake, Shelley, Byron, Keats..Lord Tennyson.. Y a uno de los mas importantes escritores de la historia, Sir Walter Scott (acuerdense que estudiaba en Escocia)

Cosas de la vida hicieron que termine aca en Argentina, donde conocio su final a manos del alcohol. 

Cuando era mas pendejo, pense que habia algo de valor en la nocion de ""mandar todo al carajo"". Tipo, darle la espalda a la ""alta sociedad"" para hacer lo que a uno le gusta. Eso tambien me hizo un poco mal cuando era pibe, porque justificaba faltar al colegio, fumar porro, todo pensando que ""estaba viviendo la vida que yo queria"". Despues creci y me di cuenta de que las oportunidades hay que agarrarlas, nadie es vivo por vivir de joda, robar, drogarse, etc. Y Luca hubiera sido un excelente musico si hubiera seguido vivo. No es mas pija ni mas groso por haber quemado su vida. 

Es facil decir ""murio en su ley"", como ""Pappo"" que murio en su ley, andando en moto en pedo. Pero no hay nada de virtud en morir joven, en un accidente. No hay nada de virtud en morir de cirrosis, solamente porque seas un buen musico. No hay nada de virtud en alejarte de las oportunidades que te presta la vida, solamente porque estas rodeado de la ""alta sociedad"" que te da asco. Hay veces que tenemos que amigarnos con el sistema, con ""la maquina"". Tenemos que buscar trabajo, mentir en el curriculum. Tenemos que rendir ese final con ese profesor que nos odia, cuando en realidad nos gustaria esperarlo afuera de la facultad con un caño galvanizado de una pulgada para cagarlo a piñas. 

Luca decidio que su vida se habia terminado antes de que se termine de hecho. Si hubiera estado en otro momento, en otro lugar, tal vez hubiera superado su adiccion, su enfermedad. Hoy lo tendriamos entre nosotros, yendo al programa de juanita viale y contando boludeces sobre las cosas que hacian en el internado, que tenia un profe de geografia que les tocaba el culo a los nenes y les pegaba con una regla ""T"", al estilo ""if...."" de Lindsay Anderson. No seria la leyenda que es hoy, claro. Pero habria tenido la posibilidad de vivir una vida normal, de casarse, tener hijos. 

Siempre hay momentos para rebelarse. Luca representa una rebeldia impresionante, era mas rebelde que cualquiera de los ""rockeros"" de este pais, como Cerati, Fito Paez, Calamaro, etc.. Pero hay que saber cuando parar con la rebeldia. La vida es una sola, hay que hacerle caso a Luca.. pero no tanto.

Think about being the one judge who allows that case to be heard.

Think about the political instability it would cause.

Think about the death threats you'd get.

Think about the idea that your ruling could result in a civil war because it would represent the total breakdown of our ability to transfer political power peacefully.

If I was a circuit judge, and Donald Trump personally brought me un-doctored video evidence of Joe Biden hacking the voter machines himself, I would make up any excuse in the book to throw that case out of court because fuck all that shit. I have no interest in being assassinated by an angry mob, igniting a civil war, or any of the other associated fallout caused by the breakdown of our ability to conduct a Presidential election.

And no offense, but I'm a LOT less scared of the right wing of American politics laboring under the idea that they were cheated out of an election that I am about the left wing being cheated out of an election. 

The right had one rally where 40,000 people showed up at the Capitol. Less then 2% of that group rioted. Not a single rioter fired a single gun. Only one person was killed as a direct result of violent injury, and that was a protester shot by Capitol police.

If the election had been overturned in Trump's favor, the radical left - that Kamala Harris went on Twitter to get them bailed out of jail the last time they rioted in over 500 different events that killed over two dozen people, injured a thousand cops, and destroyed between $2 and 5 billion dollars worth of property in every major city in the country because one bad cop negligently killed one career felon that was overdosing on meth and fentenyl while being arrested - would do everything they were physically capable of to burn the country to the ground. I'd MUCH rather deal with Jan 6, than the ACTUAL Civil War that would have happened if the left had lost an election that contentious. I trust American conservatives to be responsible in their anger and frustrations infinitely more than I trust the woke left.

So yeah if I had been a judge and Trump brought an election fraud case to me, I don't give a fuck if Trump was my cousin, and the evidence contained Joe Biden pee tapes along with a video recording of Biden's admission to colluding with lizard people to hack the voting machines. I'd throw the case out on standing and then go hide in my basement too.",1

I've decided that I will not wear makeup to conceal my skin issues because dammit, there are other people who have seen their bodies change as a result of illness, and they deserve to be normalized. If I don't do it, how long will I have to wait for somebody else to pluck up their courage and do it for me?

Having said all that, it is okay if you still don't feel comfortable with showing yourself on cam, and there are potential privacy issues to consider in regards to showing your face as well.

268,2021-12-22 06:48:48+00:00,"It has impacted my life very deeply. 

My mom got hooked on purcocet when I was a young teen. Before opiates, she was the most involved parent of all time. Always part of PTA, happy to help with extracurriculars, helped manage the school carnival, you name it. Within 4 years, she was a shell of herself, and it was hard to have a conversation with her that she would either be an active participant in or remember the next day. 

She was prescribed benzos to help sleep because apparently opiates can really mess up your sleep cycle. It was a recipe for disaster. She had a robe covered in cigarette burns and regularly lit up while on oxygen. I knew I would find her burnt to death one day. Luckily, it wasn't the smoking and passing out that got her. She beat opiates and I'm eternally proud of her for that. Unfortunately, smoking and benzos really tanked her blood oxygen. With the low blood oxygen already a problem, she got a respiratory infection that ultimately led to her passing out in our driveway on her way to the hospital. She took an anoxic hit to the brain, and we were told she had a less than 1% chance of living a life outside of being a vegetable. We pulled the plug after a week. 

My brother ended up getting on the pills, too. He aided my mom's addiction once her pain clinic started to taper her off (new regulation about over prescribing) and he made sure to make enough money to keep himself high. Pills are more expensive than heroin, so he moved on to the needle, then fetanyl became readily available, so he uses that. He's OD'ed twice. In that time, he destroyed his relationship with his girlfriend, and he is well on his way to destroying his relationship with all of his immediate family. We don't talk anymore. 

My dad was emotionally destroyed from my mom's passing and never got past it. He went from a relatively high power businessman to coasting on his retirement accounts and getting wrecked on booze before noon every day. He died this August. He was the smartest man I knew, and the person I respected the most. It breaks my fucking heart every day, and I try to remember him in the most positive light I can. 

My brother has used the opportunity of being alone in that house to go on a complete bender. Nonstop random people in the house, some don't even know his name, huge mess everywhere, drugs out in the open, etc. We called the cops for a welfare check, they did nothing. He's gone to rehab multiple times and never done anything to make it stick after he leaves. If he doesn't make sweeping changes to his entire life I have literally zero doubt he will die in the next five years, if not much sooner. 

My parents were damn good, salt of the Earth people. They worked hard to provide a good life for us, they cared deeply about everyone who came through our house, and they helped everyone they could in any way they could, be it financially, emotionally, or even just providing a place to stay. The medical system absolutely failed my mom which cascaded into really fucking up almost my entire family. They were all adults who made their own decisions, but I can't help but resent the doctor who over prescribed her in the first place, and my brother for abusing her addiction for his own gain.

Maybe in place of coke consider something with established medical doses.

 High purity methamphetamine (from a trusted , established vendor. Not off the streets) or pharmaceutical amphetamine . 

Stay within reasonable range of therapeutic doses (60 mg daily for methamphetamine) , use orally , don't snort , smoke or inject. Keep it around or under 100 mg daily if you have to go over. 

Meth is also much easier to eyeball and make a reasonable presumption on its purity than coke (it's gonna look like crystals or broken glass) 

With heroin , I feel like opiates have a much more slippery slope to addiction than stimulants. If you have to go that route stay away from needles and invest in something to test for purity. 

There is A LOT of stuff being cut with fantanyl right now.

The poor guy Amber Geiger shot that’s a tragedy but I don’t think it was race related.  Anytime an innocent person loses their life it’s a tragedy.  Black people are equal to any other people.  People tend to think I’m racist here on Reddit so let me say it again black people are EQUAL to all other people.  The BLM movement was not co-opted it was corrupt from inception and was marketed to be unquestioned.  Questioning their communist believes would mean you don’t agree that Black Lives Matter.  They played on a populace.",1

I feel like every relationship to a substance is different.  It's almost like meeting a different entity. I had a bad experience where I got some drugs that had fetanyl In them. That experience felt like the grim reaper had me in its grips.  Like psychically so messed up. It was bone chilling and I guess you could say i got scared ""straight"". These drugs will destroy you mentally, physically and spiritually. And have to feel like it's no accident these drugs are on our streets constantly at alarming levels..

I've tried other substances however that I do think were beneficial. Mostly psychedelics and I do consider weed to be psychedelic but you only can feel those effects if you do not smoke it compulsively. Mushrooms are also great. Low toxicity and they can teach you a lot but again you have to respect these life forms and not use things as a way to get ""high"".

The lethal dose stays the same, well obviously it differs a bit from human to human. But when you order fent from the dark web for example, you also can't be sure how pure it is. So if it's pure 2mg can kill you, if it's laced with whatever it might take 10mg of that product to reach the 2mg of fent. You get where I'm going with this?

So does Kamala. She's put more black and brown people on jail for minor possession charges than almost anybody in the past decade as a prosecutor.

Its pathetic that so many people vote on the idea that democrats are going to legalize everything.
Well the really radical mayors and governors are realing what they sow. Inner cities being destroyed for open drug use. Open borders and fantanyl laced heroin overdoses on street corners. Its really bad in Philadelphia now.
And I know of two (TWO) people who overdosed on fentanyl after smoking pot... yet POT laced with fentanyl.
We are in a real bad place right now. 
I've been advocating for legalization 20 years. And it will happen. But not if we keep electing these corrupt dinosaur assholes. 
Republicans are getting the picture. There are a number of them, even here in 100% illegal Tennessee that are trying to legalize cannabis. Its just a matter of time.
But you can't rely on a Democrat to do it. Because they use that carrot in a stick to lure you to the voting booth... then take it away. Because they want you there the next time to vote as well.
The old bait and switch.

Its Democrat politicians who are using people, any way the can... just like the did before Abraham Lincoln (a republican) abolished slavery.

You all realize what's been going on since the 70s. And 80s.
But those people are dead and gone.
Reagan, Nixon... and not far from now the others of that era who use drugs as a tool. 
Trump revived NYC in the 70s by developing the slummed out areas of 5th avenue. His gawdy tower is a beacon. But it worked.
Like him or hate him, he was a good president for our country. 
And he's a businessman. He understood the monetary benefits of legalization. Its just too bad were all in a democratic downhill spiral into inflation worse than Jimmy Carters era. Because the last thing anybody in DC cares about are people. 
So I'm happy for all of you in Medical legal states. I may have to buy a house in one if my wife's MS progresses to the point that she needs medical marijuana to function. 
Until then. Don't lobby Biden. Hes not even cognitive enough to know what he ate for breakfast.
You need to lobby your governors, state reps, and congressman. And demand a bill on legalization ALONE ! Not buried in a Build Back Better liberal self destruction wish list of the stupidest ideas ever dreamed up.

If you voted for one of those liberal mayers who defunded the police, and you have to drive 15 miles to go to a CVS... its your own fault. 
If you can't shop at Target because it's being ash and grab looted every week... you get what you ask for. 
If you keep voting for Democrat government... it will never be federally legal... because they will ALWAYS need to keep that carrot dangling, come time to vote.

332,2021-12-20 10:34:10+00:00,"Como eu disse, ele tomou o conselho de fechar a história logo; é um defeito da narrativa Lore.

Lá no AQW (eu tive infância) eles fizeram uma paródia pra explicar muito bem a técnica chamada Lore, através de um acrônimo: Land Of the Rising Evil.

A ideia é que sempre o mau vence, mas não vence de vez, apenas um pouquinho. Por exemplo, o heroi tem que enfrentar um bandido e resgatar a princesa, mas o bandido não apenas foge como consegue matar um aliado; ao chegar o herói é responsabilizado pela morte e usado de bode expiatório pela princesa e foge, se unindo ao bandido contra a monarquia cruel... Viu, nesse trecho o mau venceu apesar do herói ter vencido e a Lore é sempre sobre isso, escalando com poucas vitórias do mau até o grande desfecho.

O problema é que não pode ter desfecho, o que pode acontecer é o herói finalmente morrer ou partir em mais uma jornada para fora dos acontecimentos narrados e aí passar o manto de herói pra outro personagem; para que uma história tenha desfecho ela não pode usar de Lore, mas de acontecimentos mundanos.

Por exemplo, enquanto acontece o rebuliço do herói do exemplo anterior, um aventureiro invade a cadeia para resgatar seu pai e foge, deixando um rastro de morte entre as celas da masmorra. Acabou, viu? Um aventureiro resgatar seu pai é um fato fechado e de menor grandiosidade do que uma história sobre reinos corruptos, por Deus, tu nem precisa descrever em que reino fica a masmorra, apenas descrever o interior da masmorra.

Enfim, independente da obra de fantasia, assim que usarem Lore você pode ter certeza que o final vai ser decepcionante, mesmo em FFXIV tem gente dizendo que o EW foi uma porcaria e o motivo é esse, o alto acúmulo de expectativa e a necessidade de não ter um desfecho propriamente dito.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Try clove oil while you're still a little damp! I was instantly seeking MORPHENE for the pain! Jesus it BURNED! I did that before I knew anything about oils. Also, try swallowing oregano pills and using NEEM oil instead. Neem doesn't kill them quickly but it has ovicidal properties thats keeps the females from laying eggs. Just a suggestion. Lol.

1) I never heard of doctors prescribing crystal meth. Even if they do, it´s not the same form. You can´t compare a street drug with its medical equivalents that have been optimized and tested for side effects and addictive traits.

2) Even if they were completely the same, then yeah, if licensed professionals looked at my case and found that certain substances would be a good treatment for me, I am informed and being checked on for effects and side effects in an ongoing treatment, that´s not the same thing as just snorting a few lines of whatever dubious substance at a houseparty.

You´re completely ignoring the surrounding settings and circumstances under which certain substances are prescribed, so your argument is more for shock value than anything. You make it sound like I could just walk into a doctors office and get a prescription for meth. Definatley not. Strong substances are handled with extreme care and given to patients that really need them, like late-stage cancer patients. I can also say ""Doctors use morphene too, so does that mean that everybody should be able to use morphene?"" without mentioning that it is only for extreme situations like medically assisted suicide.

380,2021-12-18 16:06:38+00:00,"I think the issue is blaming substance abusers for not getting pain management. The truth is someone misusing doesn't stop a doctor from prescribing...ever. 

I was under this impression too...it's bullshit though. Some addicts have better choices then pain patients. Some addicts have access to Dilaudid, morphine and heroin legally. Yet, pain patients don't always. 

They may blame you for being a drug addict and that is why they refuse but actually they just don't trust you and don't want to be bothered. 

Doctors don't want to often deal with chronic pain patients. It depends on the person and illness.

As for the main point. I think many people may think they can scare pain patients into not taking opiods and that just shows the level of ignorance. 

There is this weird game pain patients are expected to play. Hate the ""other"" bad patient who gives them (doctors) grief and you prove you're a good one. Blaming addicted patients does nothing for the CP community. 

It just says the pain of the addict is not valid or real. And yours is ...everyone's pain is real and valid. Maybe if doctors accepted that then we would have less fentynyl deaths in USA. 

I used to hate addicts just as much as most chronic pain patients, but I now realize that this idea they make it harder for us to get treatment is a lie. 

I want the chronic pain community to accept this fact:
""The vast majority of iv drug users were physically or sexually abused as children"". 

By condemning these people, we bassically are saying as a society, ""if you were abused as a child, your pain does not matter and you are a criminal"".

The most pain I experienced was the catherder
worst thing about the whole procedure imo. I was
walking around the first day. Walked for an hour
through the hallway tonight. Still have drainage

something else for pain and numbing. Other
drugs they're giving me are heart medicine,
medicine to prevent blood clots, anti biotics, stool
softeners, Tylenol, ibuprofen, and gabopetin for
nerve pain. They only needed to use one Nuss bar

the sternum lift device that they use to lift the
sternum to prevent cardiac perforation which is
now used world wide. My haller index was 3.4. My
heart was hitting my chest wall my whole life. The
surgeon also corrected my sternum which was
not straight so now I am more synchronous in my
movements. Surgery was done at one of the best
hospitals in the USA, imo, at UPENN. Insurance

It took the govt forever to get him his unemployment money and stimulus checks, so he had to resort to crime to feed his wife and young daughter.

Unfortunately this led to him getting into hard drugs like Fetanyl and one day he was found unresponsive. 

It’s been tough but at least the silver lining that my family didn’t have to be put through him getting caught, put on trial and paraded in public as if he’s a terrible person, and then sent to jail for life because he had a baggy with 10 oz of weed on him.

He knew I had a really hard time not smoking weed if it's already in the house. In the end it's my responsibility alone, but he didn't help. If I didn't have weed in the house I was okay with just smoking cigarettes but I couldn't help myself in this situation. I kept telling him I was becoming addicted and he just didn't care.

When I finally had the guts to stand up for myself more than a year later the damage was allready done. I was barely 16 years old and addicted to something I used to do once or twice a month. I was severely depressed and it took me years to be able to stop. That didn't make me any happier. I probably messed up my dopamine system or something by smoking so much for so long, starting at such an age.

That was years ago, I still smoke daily. Use amphetamines to get anything done and take O-DSMT, a research chemical opiate when I start smoking at the end of the day. Weed is the only drug that has been there almost constantly. I have repeatedly proven to myself I can cut down my use or stop completely for weeks at first, than a few months. It just makes my depressed life even more unhappy. It's legal where I live and I smoke what I grow myself mostly, so it has a negligible impact on my finances.

I've had a few short but heavy bouts of alcoholism and I used to sniff and completely tweak out from my medical amphetamines. Tried shrooms and MDMA a few times and both could be summed up as fun but _sooo wierd_. I tried one pill of oxycodon once from a friend and I am SOOOOO glad I just had the one. If I had stable access to oxy I'd probably be dead by now. Tramadol and opium are the absolute tits as far as I'm concerned.

453,2021-12-16 13:41:30+00:00,"Me voy a extender un poco en el post porque siento que puedo llegar a darte una perspectiva distinta.  
Yo siento que acá hay dos posturas bien marcadas con el tema: Politizarlo o no politizarlo. El resto, es mandarina.  


Desde aquellos que deciden politizar el tema, podes tomar cualquiera de los lados y armar un show de como eso es lo mas conveniente. No me quiero centrar en este punto porque justamente yo decidí no politizarlo (como muchas cosas en la vida) pero si voy a mencionar que no soy un creyente de los argumentos ""slippery slope"" o pendiente resbaladiza. La idea de que el ser humano es comparable con un sapo al que van cocinando lentamente me parece ridicula, y, si bien los humanos somos susceptibles a manipulaciones y a mandarnos cagadas, tarde o temprano más gente empieza a sentir que le estan tocando el culo y sale a pelear por lo que cree correcto. Tampoco soy partidario de que ""todo es politica"" (si bien entiendo a que refiere la frase en la teoria).  


Habiendo dicho eso, vamos a lo importante. Analicemos el tema vacunas como algo ""no politizado"". Lo primero que yo reconozco es que el 95% de los productos que se consumen en este mundo se consumen a ciegas. Es decir, confiamos ciegamente en que la empresa que los produce o el estado que regula nos va a ""proteger"", o incluso, podemos no confiar pero correr el riesgo apañado de dos logicas bien sencillas:  
\-""Un monton de gente lo consume"".  
\-""Que interes tiene la empresa en asesinar a sus clientes?"".  


Y ambas logicas sirven para analizar a -grosso modo- todo lo que en la vida no sentimos que requiera semejante analisis como el que ponemos sobre esto. Nunca pedimos estudios sobre los productos que nos venden, nunca exigimos nada. Y el mismo sistema nos empuja a confiar en que los intereses de las personas alineadas en el proceso de produccion evitan que algo malo suceda. Y estamos hablando de alimentos, bebidas, cosmeticos, drogas, otras vacunas, drogas ilegales, y miles de productos que consumimos.  


Puede fallar? Si! y hay ejemplos como la Talidomida o la Heroina. A veces se alinea todo para la catastrofe. El empleado, que no tiene interes en perder su laburo, se equivoco de ingrediente y terminamos con un lote contaminado, y justo el sistema de testeo/validacion no estaba bien pensado y terminas con una desgracia. Pero podemos estar todos de acuerdo en que la empresa no tenia tampoco interes en dañar su marca/imagen con algo asi.   
En un caso asi, la logica capitalista invita  a la empresa a hacer ""control de daños"" y tratar de tapar lo mas posible semejante error. La busqueda de justicia para los afectados puede tardar años si es que alguna vez llega... historia conocida ya no?  


Entonces entra en juego la primer logica ""Un monton de gente lo consume"". Lo que voy a decir es cierto pero crudo: Mientras mas gente esta afectada por un problema, mas rapido se llega a la solución.  
Y aca es a donde juega comoda la vacuna: TODOS LOS OJOS ESTAN AHI. Y muchisima gente se vacuno.  
Entonces:  
\-Los intereses de los laboratorios son altisimos para que no haya una desgracia porque se haria publica MUY rapidamente (Siendo de impacto global).  
\-Los intereses de los gobiernos tambien son en pos de que la vacuna no de problemas. La indemnización es lo de menos, estas hablando de un problema similar a un terremoto. Es mucha gente, por mas que pongan la clausula que pongan alguien tiene que responder. Y si el gobierno no responde, la gente lo tira abajo y saldra votado el que prometa que ""el que se puso la vacuna, recibira dolares"" Digooooo. jajajaja usted me entiende.  
\-Los poderosos del mundo se vacunaron tambien, eso pesa jajaja.  
\-Nunca tantas marcas/sistemas/gobiernos estuvieron tan al borde del peligro.  
\-Consumo diariamente cosas que no tienen ni el 1% del testeo (ni se lo exigo).  


No tiene ni sentido discutirlo!  


Con respecto al pase... es una forma (poco elegante) de empujar a la gente que falta. Las medidas de los gobiernos estan apuntadas a un beneficio social por sobre lo individual y estas medidas solo son posibles cuando la mayoria de la población ya esta vacunada y ""no le jode"". Despues del analisis de arriba, si alguien me pide que tenga un pase sanitario, mi respuesta es ""no me jode, no me cambia en nada"".

Mislim, početna teza ili bar naslov ti je pogrešno formulisan.
Kolokvijalno se narkomanima označavaju oni koji koriste drogu i nezavisni su od iste. Kolokvijalno u to ne spadaju cigare, pa i alkohol.

Da ne dubim. 
Ne, smatram da pušači nisu ekvivalentni narkomanima, iako su zavisni. Iako uništava zdravlje, s druge strane pušači nemaju te poremećaje mentalne i psihičke, zbog kojih ne mogu da funkcionišu normalno. Potpuno isto važi za one koji koriste kanabis. S druge strane imamo zavisnika od heroina, kokaina, i svačega još, koji potpuno urušavaju svoje fizičko i mentalno zdravlje do te mere da ne mogu funkcionisati normalno. To su, barem za mene, narkomani. Efekat kanabisa traje relativno kratko vreme (u zavisnosti od količine I učestalosti u datom periodu). Izuzetno su retki agresivni slučajevi.

Protivnici kanabisa, koji su istovremeno pušači, kao što si ti spomenuo, su samo neobrazovani i glupi ljudi. U istom rangu homofoba, rasista i slično. Naravno, težina nije ista, ali je jasno da su to ljudi koji nisu i ne žele da se edukuju po pitanju određene teme.",1

Why they gave me so many extra I don’t know. The pain went away but the cravings got stronger so I took them until there wasn’t anymore. I sat in my garage at 15 for 2.5 hours trying to smash one with a hammer just so I could snort it and get high again. This led me into a really dark place at a super young age. I completely destroyed all bonds with anyone who cared about me parents included just because I wanted to get high. I stopped doing drugs at 17 but it was already too late I’m left with life long consequences because of my dumb decisions at a young age. By the grace of god my parents are forgiving people and look past all my prior actions.

How did humans become designed to do certain things or exhibit certain behaviors? How are traits passed down? How does DNA fingerprinting work? Do vitamin supplements actually work and what effect do they have? Dopamine, serotonin, oxycotin— what are they? How do drugs, like LSD/ecstasy work inside our body and why do they make us feel good/bad? What about caffeine? Why are emotions temporary— and why is it that we are never happy forever when we finally achieve our lifelong dream? Can we REALLY trust our “instincts”? And finally, the topic that blew my mind the most: why exactly do we help others (altruism)?

If you’ve wondered most of the questions above, you should take this class. Sure you could Google, but I think it’s special if you hear it from Professor Phelan himself.

You can even P/NP (it is a little difficult for an A in-person but doable, easy asf pass or B though). It also counts as a Life Science GE if you guys need it.

Be aware tho— it’s not the easiest A out there even though BruinWalk and everyone on this sub says so! A lot of my peers felt the same way as me. This was asynchronous + in-person discussions with online exams, I assume in-person is gonna be harder because damn I NEEDED my notes for the exam.",1

Schedule 1 are the strictest. They are highly addictive and at risk of abuse AND have no medical purpose per the FDA &amp; CDC guidelines.. These are things like cocaine, heroin, weed, etc. (Weed is arguable but right now that's what the law classifies it as)

Schedule 2 are Highly addictive and high risk of abuse, but have select medical purpose in some cases. These are basically any drugs that are addictive and require a prescription. Oxycotin, Morphine, Codine, etc. They're very dangerous risk of addiction but are medically usable under guidance of a doctor.

Schedule 3 are drugs that have moderate to low addiction. When abused they can develop dependencies but are less risky than schedule 1 and 2. They are usually available with a prescription but not over the counter.

Schedule 4 are drugs that have a low but not non-existent risk of addiction or abuse. You can get addicted if you use it incorrectly or abuse it but it's for the most part safe. Xanax, Valium, etc

Schedule 5 are drugs that are prepared with a small quantity of a narcotic. This is things like cough syrup. They can be abused if taken in large quantities but in general you aren't gonna develop an addiction without actually working at it.",1

For most opiates for potentiation you would take your cimetidine and/or grapefruit juice 45-60min before dosing, and then you would take your antihistamine like diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine or promethazine 20 min before and then take an antacid. It gets in your system ahead of time to help prevent nausea and other side effects when you dose and does sometimes potentiate. But for codeine specifically I was wrong. You wouldn’t want to do that because codeine has minimal opiate activity and the majority of its effects come from its metabolic conversion at a rate of 10% into morphine by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 and some antihistamines like promethazine and other normal opiate potentiators can slightly to moderately inhibit CYP2D6 (this wouldn’t matter for something like hydrocodone or oxycodone because even though CYP2D6 converts them into their -morphone counterparts it’s also at a rate of 10% which is minimal since oxycodone and hydrocodone already have a high bioavailability and potency. The bigger hit is CYP3A4 which converts the -codones into their N-Demethylated form where even though noroxycodone and norhydrocodone have about the same potency as their parent compound the lack of the methyl group at the N position prevents it from crossing the blood brain barrier. And 30+% gets N-demethylated by CYP3A4 But most CYP3A4 inhibitors happen to also inhibit CYP2D6",1

The patient was running out on a previous moneymaking drug, so it was reformulated. Wealthy people invest in pharmaceutical companies with the expectation of profits. The purpose of these companies is to make money for shareholders. To make a profit it's most effective to develop moneymaking drugs, and the most profitable drugs are addictive. The Pharmaceutical companies may not have been deliberately getting people addicted; they were simply following the money. So someone goes to the hospital or doctor with back pain and gets prescribed painkillers. That person gets physically addicted. Not everyone does, but it's a risk of the drug. Once they are addicted but can't get a prescription, they move to illegal drugs.

Throughout the mid-south we have a great number of people working past retirement age because they can't afford not to work, causing a lack of job opportunities for the inexperienced. We were struck hard and fast by the opioid epidemic when Oxycontin came out, and our area (a lot of physical labor jobs -&gt; more injuries -&gt; more pills -&gt; higher chance of dependency) is still struggling with it, not to mention cheaper highs like methamphetamine and fetanyl laced substances. There just aren't that many jobs that aren't factory work, so a lot of people in the rural areas don't even see the point of getting a college degree or look down on those who do, further disincentivesing people to do better for themselves.

I assume that it can't really be found because most people are looking for recreational drugs hence not much demand for it.

Maybe if they are willing to throw money into researching it and selling it it'll be a regular prescription drug instead of the tightest controlled schedule drugs due to it being less abusable than MPH.

Not a Sore subject. An example? 21st bday went to titty bar, he rolled up a $50 and said, here kid, shove this right in her pussy. I was like “haha” and he shook his head and said “I’ll show ya” and literally shoved it in there. We then fought the bouncers out to the truck… 
But he was super “defender of women” when it came to beating on them….. except for my mom of course, which leads us to…

Divorced lol. Good on her. He didn’t show up to my 5th bday, we packed and left. Also he had beat the crap out of her that week, for what would be the last time.


He had an alcohol problem, really serious one. Like really really serious. I had a good relationship with him when o was grown and he was sober for a stint. He was a great guy. But, when he was drinking he wasn’t that same guy. It was like schizophrenia. He didn’t even look the same. I lived in with him at 17, was out by 22. We had our ups and downs. More downs then ups. He died in his early sixties from heart issues probably. Though I think he overdosed on pills for the actual cause.

Servicemen are getting nothing of our inflated military budget. They are the muscle enforcing the military industrial narco prison system by defending American interests abroad. Our interests being continuing to hide that the highest members of our society have secret pockets that bring heroin and crack into the country. 

Fetanyl is chinas attempt at getting in on the game of destroying American society. They don’t realize the cia and J.P. Morgan who import the heroin and cocaine are doing it for the money. Chinas doing it to destroy the fabric of our society. 

Heroin is concentrated refined acetylized morphine and I’m sure just legalizing and regulating opium would give people an out from the only drugs available now that the doctors cut everyone off.

Most of the fetanyl in the US was made in China and smuggled in using Mexican Cartel routes just like most Cocaine comes from Columbia.  I was with the Mexican Air Force and Navy 3 years ago for a week and they had 2 main security concerns.  The first was non-Mexican immigrants passing through Mexico to get to the US. The second was the massive growth and power of drug cartels and the subsequent further delegitimization of the Mexican government.  They used to have a policy of taking out the cartel leaders but what that caused was more violence when subordinate leaders fought and killed for control in the power vacuum.  Their main goal is to keep US law enforcement as busy as they can so they can make more profits on drug shipments.  Child trafficking and prostitution are side businesses for them as they’ve branched out.  Immigrant smugglers are known as coyotes and its a multi-billion dollar industry.

I'm assuming you were prescribed Suboxone since you're worried about it being on your chart; but I need to know the reason behind it.

I was in the exact cycle and after Butrans was ineffective (same issue with Fentanyl - transdermal just doesn't work for me) - I asked to be put on Suboxone. The doses they gave me were unholy and it was the worst 2 yrs of my life.

I see you define addict as ""Street drug use"" but by not acknowledging you are addicted to opioids is to do yourself a disservice. You said you needed Methadone to ""hold you over"". If there was no dependence then you could use Tylenol for that.

Anyway, I'm back on Oxycodone but without the Tylenol since I take too much as it is. So my chart shows I was on Suboxone for pain and it didn't work. I really had my choice this time around and I debated between Oxy and take-home Methadone tablets but stuck with what I knew.

If you're using for pain and don't want the label of addict; why do you want Suboxone? Their website literally says it is NOT intended to be prescribed for pain relief. But money talks and there's much more leniency and less worry on their end to give Suboxone over more helpful medications.

You can be as honest as you want with me; I've been there, am still there and fight through chronic pain every single day. Did you get the Suboxone through Pain Management? Because you aren't blacklisted if it was attempted for pain and just became ineffective.

You have to use Pain Management if you're in the USA. I advise against Oxycontin because the new gel formula makes me literally sick. But MSContin makes MUCH more sense for true pain relief than Suboxone. We all say ""we've tried every doctor, nobody wants to help"" until we find a place that will help.

Hope this wasn't a waste of time to type out. Just please don't use the stigma you currently do about ""addicts"". I am glad you caught the cancer in time and beat it. You being alive is most important. I would definitely try Kratom, start with Red Maeng Da strains. If your state allows it why not get a MMJ card? Not only will you get relief but you will also ""look better"" at PM clinics for spending out of pocket to manage pain",2

I'm 38 and a punk rocker from the 90's. Ex train hopper and wasteoid. I didn't get heavy into hard drugs but always drank my ass off. I put the booze away a couple years ago and to my surprise some of my friends did also. We had a bond on that amongst many other bonds from a previous life.
 I know first hand as many of of you do, drinking all the time ruins lives. Not only yours but the people around you that love you. The fucked up thing is that those people still love you at their wits end and they will be sad forever loving you if you continue.
 This post is about money and the financial toll it takes on fools who drink their asses off.
 I'm not here to brag on how much money I spent on booze. I'm sure it's a lot and I'm sure I spent tons of money while wasted out of my mind (gambling, weed, food, taxis, and hospital bills)
 Last night a friend of mine who I used to share the stage with and rock the fuck out with, od'd after not partying for 3 years. He didn't hit the bar with his friends and wife, he didn't spend shit loads of money. He took every one home, made sure they where safe and then out of nowhere bought $20 worth of pills from a ""friend"" of his. Just out of nowhere. Relapse, out of nowhere. Not booze, not getting wasted. But ultimately he did get wasted, he od'd. Those weren't pain killers. Those were fentenyl. He thought ""whatever"", I'll just do this instead of my old school vice.
  Boom, dead.
Imagine all the times we wanted to die while drinking our asses off and couldn't do it? How many times did we wish so much not to wake up after the fuckery? With our hands bleeding, people crying in the distance, alone. On a street, somewhere.
 He had it all my friends, whatever that means to you, he had it.

El tratar de asustar a la gente diciendo: SON MALAS!!!!! TE VAS A MORIR!!!!! SON DEL DIABLO!!!!! es tratar de asustar y cuando alguien las prueba, y se pasa un rato chido, ve que no se muere y no habló con el diablo (a menos de que el pasón esté bien chido) pues dice: Son mamadas lo que me dicen. 

Lo que se necesita es educación, hablar las cosas como lo que son realmente. Lo primero que hay que hacer es llamarles por sus nombres; Cocaina, heroina, mota, LSD, meta anfetamina, etc. Y decir que hace realmente cada una de ellas con su uso, ya sea casual, cotidiano o atascado. 

La coca no hace lo mismo que la mota, la heroina afecta cosas diferentes que la anfeta y no todas son mortales. 

Pero nadie quiere decir la verdad. Es más fácil condenar que educar. Si me dices si te metes X te va a pasar Y. Pues ya sabré si lo hago o no.

Slava je zajebana stvar, jednom kad je osetis to je kao heroin, nema nazad. I svaki dan ti treba neka mala potvrda da si slavan i da te ljudi znaju i da si uspeo. Tesko se skida sa toga. Pricam o ljudima koji nisu super zvezde ali su prepoznatljivi, takvih ima najvise. Neki to dobiju kad izadju na ulicu i vide da ih ljudi primecuju pogledima a vecina kuci citajuci o sebi na internetu. Poznajem par ljudi koji spadaju u tu grupu i pricao sam sa njim mnogo puta na tu temu. E sad, sve zavisi od tebe kao licnosti kako ces to da hendlujes ali vecina uzasno podnosi negativne komentare na internetu. Da li su to komentari ispod clanka na kuriru/blicu, da li su ispod tvoje objave na instagramu, da li kad te mim stranica zajebava pa komentari njihovih pratioca, jutjub komentari itd. Ako ste ikada napisali nesto o nekom poznatom, pa makar i ovde, sanse su 90% da je to procitao. I ovde lurkuju reddit i vise nego sto mislite. Dosta njih gugla sebe po ceo dan, a i prijatelji im salju linkove i screenshotove tamo gde ih spominju. Cesto osecaju da im slava pada, da nisu relevantni neko vreme, upadaju u krize, vracaju se na stare jutjub klipove da gledaju kako je to nekad bilo, voleli bi opet da osete taj fix slatkog heroina u veni.

Mnogi sa dodirom slave imaju problem sa egom i sujetom (""znas ti ko sam ja""), pa tu zavisi kakav si covek i koliki ces debil biti oko toga, neko je skroman a neko postane ultra egoista i bahat, tipa ucesnici rijaliti programa. Svi oni tamo idu samo zbog te male slave, da mogu ljudi poput njih, ostali debili, da ih prepoznaju kad odu na splav i klub, i da se zna o njima, to je citava poenta zasto idu u te rijalitije i u stanju su da provedu tamo godinu dana za dzabe i da pisaju i kenjaju po njima svaki dan, sve je to vredno samo da osete malo te slave kad odu u ""Dva Galeba"". Sto se tice bahatosti licno sam prisustvovao svadji oko parkinga i da je doticna rekla ""Ja sam bre iz Velikog Brata"" (ima 15ak godina od toga).

Mnogi imaju gomilu svojih alt naloga, sami sebi pisu komentar (botuju za sebe i sami sebi spreme sendvic) pa to je jedan Kevin Durant iz NBA radio, sta ocekivati tek od manjih ljudi sa nasih prostora. A pritom taj covek je na milionima, ovi o kojima ja pricam nemaju ni para. Velike zvezde zive u vilama sa bazenima i voze lamba i dalje ih pogadja sta pisu o njima, a nase ""zvezde"" najcesce zive prosecno kao i mi.

Srecni su samo oni koji znaju to da iskuliraju i da ih ti komentari ne doticu. Moras biti svestan da ce uvek biti pljuvacine, ljudi pljuju Novaka Djokovica a nece tebe koji si neki voditelj, imas 2 usrane pesme ili si si neki influenser. Retki su koji umaju to da hendluju. Ako ste ikada napisali usrani komentar nekome ogromne su sanse da je taj to video, sedeo kuci i zapalio pljugu jer se iznervirao i da ste mu upropastil dan. I ja sam ovde pisao o nekima sve najgore (Ognjen Amidzic my favorite), i svi mi pljujemo manje ili vise, u ljudskoj je prirodi.

Ali ono..trebalo bi da smanjimo.

Ford calculated the cost of human lives at $20k, saw the cost of recalling and fixing the explosion issue was higher $20k, said settling deaths was acceptable, and then let the Pintos burn.

The taper is a no go for me; because if I don’t have THIS dose (sometimes this dose doesn’t even do it) I actually cannot speak… or get cold water on my tongue or food without it being so bad I cry and drop to the floor. Otherwise the taper would be no problem and I’d use kratom and dxm.
I have my birthday on the 21st; my gfs bday and my bday so I literally cannot be bed bound and unable to eat or drink these weeks. Last time I didn’t have my meds I was extremely malnourished and was hospitalized for that because I couldn’t eat, lost so much weight, I was suicidal and going to act on it it hurts so bad I can’t take it.
With my pain meds I live a pretty normal life. I have a responsibility to drive my step child to functions to these next few weeks so being without just isn’t an option:( 
I will look for my medicine. 
But honestly, taking a risk on the fetanyl and taking a very low dose of it sounds much more reasonable (and safer) than putting myself through what I know will happen without medicine. I can’t imagine all of that on top of withdrawal, I don’t think id survive and I’m not putting that lightly.
I will look again tomorrow; and if I can’t find them I’ll likely at least browse on the darknet and maybe ask some family to see if they can help me,
I’m terrified because I’m still also recovering from a brain surgery and am struggling with depression pretty badly from it. I am fighting like hell. 
This definitely won’t happen again, I just have to make it though this time somehow, thanks for your response and concern, it will make me very careful about pills on the darknet, might as well assume it’s all fetanyl it sounds like.
This sucks. My doctor would rather me be skinny as a rail unable to eat and playing Russian roulette with illegal drugs than help me out.

These are the most sought after drugs on the planet. I am a young person with tons of stress; I don’t carry around a gun and I’m not very strong. Pills being stolen is something that is going to happen and there should be protocols in place. This makes me feel like my doctor doesn’t care about me at all and they’d rather me just drop dead than anything go wrong.
I get this is my fault, but there are scenarios in which the pills could’ve been stolen with me doing EVERYTHING right. Break ins happen, car break ins happen. People get held at gunpoint. I just can’t believe this and I feel it’s going to leave me bitter and angry at my doctors.",1

 Marijuana, alcohol, meditation or exercise couldn't help. The only thing that helped was oxycotin (which is obviously not healthy or good for the long term). I was also super depressed with how fucked up the world was. 

I was later put on wellbutrin. I did it for a month. It did help with the headaches but not so much for the depression. 

I was planning on doing Ayahuasca for the headaches (I had experience with it beforehand), but I also had a tendonitis injury for several months. Tried a whole lot of stuff for that (I don't want to get into the details at the moment), and later found out about Kambo from this subreddit about how its good for physical pain.

 Long story short, the Kambo didn't do too much for me (it does help other people though) BUT I was given Sananga  and have been doing it daily. Which has been WAY better than wellbutrin.

696,2021-12-07 11:49:48+00:00,"I'll throw in a PSA here as someone who's had to use narcan more times than I can remember (and had it administered to me once, too): definitely include some info related to using the narcan, especially stayng with/monitoring the person for a couple of hours after administering. People can slip back into an overdose as the narcan starts to wear off, so additional doses may be required. Also, it's good to know that one dose of narcan may not be enough to pull them out of the initial overdose, so keep multiple doses on hand (I once had to use three injections before the person came to, before the nasal spray was more common). Typically you administer the first dose, and if they don't respond within two minutes, administer another (also CPR/rescue breaths in between, as the primary reaction in an OD you're concerned with is slowed/no breathing). And obviously, seek professional medical attention ASAP (I should note here, you could also look up Good Samaritan laws in your state and include that info with the narcan; these laws encourage people to call 911 for an overdose by offering immunity, generally for possession of smaller amounts of drugs/paraphernalia. Knowing they won't get in legal trouble if they call 911 can make a HUGE difference in saving someone's life.)

Also helpful to know that narcan can be administered any time someone is OD'ing, even if you don't know what drug(s) they took. Narcan only works on opioids, but it won't hurt if they've taken something else; it just won't be effective at stopping the OD.

Final narcan info tidbit: if the person was using opioids, narcan will cause withdrawal symptoms. This is extremely unpleasant (obviously) and it's not unheard of for someone to say they wish you hadn't given them narcan in the aftermath of coming to. My ex was actually put on suicide watch for three days after waking up in the hospital post-OD; he told me ""I wish you hadn't done that. You should've just let me die."" That wasn't something he felt long-term, but just in the first hours after the OD. It might be helpful for the person giving the narcan to know that, so they can mentally prepare in case they are faced with such a reaction, and know that they absolutely did the right thing (even if the person they saved tells them otherwise). Also, people will want to use again after the overdose to try to mitigate the withdrawals. If you can't stop them from using again, try to get them to wait as long as possible before doing so, use less than they normally would, and *stay with them* (or have another trusted person do so) in case they OD again.

One last (not narcan-related) thing: I second another comment to include drug testing steps as well, especially with the prevalence of fentantyl these days.

1- Es hiriente que te refieras a mujeres trans usando pronombres masculinos ""el que se vestia de mujer"" bla bla bla.

Imaginate que tenes un amigo rubio, y vos le decis rubio trolo. A el no le gusta, y te pide que no lo hagas. ¿Eso cambia el hecho de que sea un rubio trolo? Depende de muchos factores irrelevantes para este ejemplo choto, lo importante es que depende de la sensibilidad de la persona, tu amigo rubio puede dejar de ser tu amigo, re chuparle un huevo lo que le digas, o incluso llegar a matarse.

Me acuerdo que muchos imbeciles se burlaban de que las personas trans tenian una espectativa de vida de 35 años.

Tengo problemas de salud mental, y creo que gran parte de esos problemas no son intrinsecos mios, sino que surgieron a partir de mis relaciones con la ""sociedad"" Y eso que soy un flaco cisgenero común, quiza un toque más hombre que los porteños por ser del interior.

La cosa es que fuck, uno escucha como hablan algunas personas de las personas trans, y me puedo imaginar cual debe ser una de las principales causas de muerte.

Terminando con el mucho texto, y pido disculpas por escribir tantas boludeces.

2. La diferencia entre un travesti y una mujer trans, es que como señalaste, una persona que se trasviste, es alguien que se pone ropa normalmente señalada como la que usan las del genero opuesto.

Dato curioso, Juana de Arco, la heroina catolica por excelencia, fue juzgada por travestirse (usaba armadura y ropas de hombre).

Realmente hay muchisimos motivos por los que una persona puede llegar a usar ropa no correspondiente a su genero, hay gente que lo hace por boludear, gente que lo hace tipo cosplay, y gente que lo hace más por connotaciones sexuales (tipo fetiches y eso).

Eso de los/las Drags es eso, mas por una cuestión de entretenimiento/show que por otra cosa.

Quisiera señalar además que travestirse, es realizar una acción (travestir creo que es el verbo), osea, si boludeando te pones la pollera de tu hermana, te estas travistiendo. Lo señalo porque, no necesariamente signifique algo, muchas personas que se travisten son cisgenero y heterosexuales.

Ahora, con respecto a la transexualidad, es todo un tema.

La mayoria de la gente es cisgenero (cis = mismo, cisgenero = mismo genero, haciendo alusión a que la persona es del mismo genero del que nacio)

Pero, hay una parte de la población que no lo es.

Son las personas trans (trans = otro/atraves(?)). Creo que hay muchisimos estudios con conclusiones muy distintas, hay quienes piensan que se debe a cuestiones biologicas como diferencias en el desarrollo cerebral, y hay quienes piensan que es mas una cuestión social/cultural.

Independientemente de si la gente trans nace asi, o se vuelve asi, la gente trans existe. Y si, no voy a decir que son todo mariposas y arcoiris. 

Entiendo el desagrado ( y todas esas cosas que mucha gente muy sensible consideraria transfobicas) porque a veces tambien me pasa. He visto gente trans que me parecio desagradable.

No se trata de decir ""awww si esta todo re piola"", sino de decir ""por más distinto e incomprensible que me parezca otra persona, sigue siendo una persona, y se merece respeto, como yo tambien me lo merezco"".

717,2021-12-06 13:34:07+00:00,"From what I remember on the toxicology report there was fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, oxycodone and hydrocodone in Peep's system. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the oxycods were laced with fentanyl, but why was there hydromorphone (dilaudid) and oxymorphone (opana) in his system? Those drugs are extremely strong opioids and NOT street drugs. They wouldn't even be in laced pills or be available recreationally. Those 2 are usually sourced from hospitals. Do you think FAE may have been involved in giving Peep dilaudid and opana on that tour?  There's NO WAY I believe that those 2 drugs were laced into rec drugs, or provided by fans or anyone on that bus. 

&amp;#x200B;

4 years on, there's no mention of opana or dilaudid pills, which are the uncommon ROA. These drugs are typically used only in hospital settings, and are usually sourced in vials for IV administration. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm only trying to help hypothesise and I'm sure /u/lwomackTaz you already know about the dilaudid and opana. Apologies in advance if I'm coming off brusque. But the existence of those 2 opiates in his system is what makes the least sense to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either someone administered oxy/hydro morphone or too much oxy/hydro codone was metabolised to the ""morphones"" via the CYP2D6 enzyme. So perhaps Peep had a CYP2D6 polymorphism and that's what led to him metabolising the ""codones"" into the ""morphones"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting thing to note is that the late rapper Juice WRLD died of an oxycodone overdose, but no oxymorphone (opana) was found in his system upon his toxicology report. This is either because he did not take opana, or wasn't a fast metaboliser via CYP2D6. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Hallucinations like on LSD without the headspace (at least in moderate dose). The story did not age well with the girl. We were both teenagers and I gave her the drug when we were together in Spain holidays (summer time). We took it alone at the beach when the sky was full of stars. We weren’t that close before 2Cb but than we started cuddling and so on at the Beach. Felt amazing and it was her first drug use. When we were back in Germany she visited me regularly and she has chronic stomach pain (but likely it’s more a mental thing than body related) and I gave her 10mg Oxy (I never gave her any other drugs and I just couldn’t watch her cry). Later she got together with a regular drug user/Dealer and broke up with me and started taking Oxycodon. She was always a very good student but I know that her grades dropped. I think she’s fine now and broke up with her new friend. Just a few weeks back she unblocked me and wanted contact with me again but I blocked her immediately.

He's Spirit and Christ through the word of God explains all of this in the scriptures.  You may have read, but you have not understood. 
Jesus explains to Nicodemus that he must be born of the spirit to be saved and Nicodemus being a pharasee ( knew the law of God forward and back ) yet he had no understanding about what Christ was talking about.
We as physical beings understand physical things.
We cannot understand spiritual things unless revealed to us through the Spirit of God, that is why things of God make no sense to the naked eye.
The bible says the Gospel of Jesus Christ is foolishness to those that are parishing.
I'm sincerely sorry that you were raised the way you were, bc that is not biblical. God is love and love is kind and patient..

Everyone of your questions is answered in the book of Life.
I'm sorry the answer to all your questions is prayer but prayer is not a bad plan.

A Roman soldier never saw God, yet he prayed and gave alms to the homeless in faith and one day and Angel appeared to him to let him know that his prayers were heard.

Addiction is not just strength of a drug, it's mental illness , lack of healthy relationships, lack of meaning in life etc the drug of choice is relative at that point because if everything is fucked in your life and something takes the pain away for just half a day then it doesn't matter if it's heroin, alcohol or weed.

After a few moments he said that he saw a guy near his patio, pacing and seeming to chase the place, maybe trying to climb the wall. He raised two very large guns, one in each  hand, and pointed them in opposite directions on either side of the room(one toward the patio sliding doors and the other toward the front door). I leapt up so quickly, panicking, thinking this was going to be robbery. I tried to stammer that we needed to leave and he shouted ""sit down!"".

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Los narcos se ganan plata en lo que se encuentren y legalizar las drogas no va a cambiar eso pero si les va a quitar un flujo de ingresos. A medida que eso pasa van disminuyendo el numero de personas que pueden ganarse la vida con actividades ilegales.

&gt; Si se empezara a legalizar en Colombia y en México y estados unidos no, aun así los carteles buscarían maneras de contrabandear con mayor facilidad a mi país o Cuba para pasarlo a USA y por ende habría más violencia tanto en México como USA.

Esto es especulación. No sabemos que pasaría si se legaliza en Colombia y en otros países no. Pero si sabemos que va a seguir pasando si se mantiene ilegal aca. Colombia (y Mexico) van a poner los muertos y Estados Unidos va a poner la plata. Vivo en Estados Unidos y dejeme decirle, este pais de mierda no va a legalizar la cocaina en este siglo si no lo obligan. Es la excusa perfecta para encarcelar a las personas y trabajarlos como esclavos (en especial a los afroamericanos y a los pobres).

La crisis opioide allá en Canadá y Estados Unidos es muy grave. Básicamente para mover coca, los carteles colombianos y Mexicanos tienen alianzas entre ellos  para que los carteles aquí la pasen allá y los carteles en el sur disrtribuyan fentanilo y heroina en Sudamérica y Europa. Los chinos, norcoreanos y afganos ilegalmente transportan esa materia prima que en América no se da o al menos con facilidad acá a México y los carteles fabrican la droga en los desiertos para diatribuirla mundialmente. 

A lo que voy es que los carteles al ver que la coca pierde su valor, van a voltear a ver con mayor fuerza a las drogas sintéticas y esos gobiernos asiáticos con su secretismo, verán maneras de meterlo por la selva etc para que se distribuya. Al ser más adictivas qué la coca ¿qué imaginas hará la gente adicta a la coca? Por tanto tendrías ya no que ver coca, sino sintéticas y es un cuento de nunca acabar.

809,2021-12-02 16:56:49+00:00,"It very difficult to predict what any given doctor might do, especially these days. The nice thing about oxycodone is the single tablet does goes as high as 30mg. There is a 15mg tablet between the 10mg and the 30mg, so the logical thing would be just to bump you up to 15mg. They dont always do what is logical, unfortunately.

When ever you talk about a failing dose with a doctor you should have some pretty concrete examples of how the lack of efficacy is affecting you functionally. If its harder to reach the top shelf in the kitchen, they need to hear it. I'm sure you have plenty of examples. Keep in mind Pain Management is not really about managing pain, but increasing function and maintaining a quality of life.

They used to call it a ""drug vacation"" before addicts made it mean something else, but its not an uncommon strategy to change the medication to something that your receptors are not yet saturated with. Doctors like this option because many times they can get away with a lower than equivalent dose since you will be less tolerant to the new medication. That allows them to use lower doses and even weaker drugs, but that weaker drug thing is totally subjective. Morphine might be considered weaker than oxycodone but you may still get a better result from a lower than equivalent dose. Hydrocodone is considered almost the same strength-wise as oxycodone, but the dose availability is much smaller and you have to get it mixed with acetaminophen. You can get a stronger Extended Release version of hydrocodone without the apap, but going to an ER sort of changes things a lot.

But an ER drug might be something to look at. It's often hard to tell, but is your current medication strong enough, but just not lasting? It also matters what kind of pain youre dealing with. If its an injury that youre expected to gradually show some improvement, ER drugs are not a good choice. You have to be able to feel how the healing is going, so you are expected to endure some degree of pain instead of it being muffled 24/7.

I wish I could just list a hierarchy of what is believed to be stronger than what, but these days there are other things that doctors take in to consideration above pain. Addiction potential for example, which is really a myth. An addict will abuse whatever is at hand, their goals (to get high) are achieved through literal over dosing. Pain relief is very different in that respect, too high a dose makes a lot of people sick. There's little pain relief to be found wrapped around a toilet heaving your guts out. Still that is often a doctors first consideration, how addictive they believe a drug to be. There is a drug called Buprenorphine that many doctors go to right after a 10mg dose of oxycodone starts to fail (there is a false security they have that its the same dose as is available in Percocet which they consider fairly safe since its a commonly used Rx). Buprenorphine is a little unique as far as opioids go. If used too close to a ""normal"" opioid like oxycodone, it can bring on instant opioid withdrawal. If you leap that hurdle okay, there is a functional dose limit (meaning after a certain amount adding more wont do a damn thing). And the tolerance curve is close to vertical, so you reach that max dose very quickly. And there are some buprenorphine based medications that are strictly for addiction control (Suboxone, Subutex). Once on a drug used to treat addiction, it can be very difficult to get back to more effective ""normal"" opioids.

Some docs will jump from oxycodone to a low dose fentanyl patch. Again the main concern with this is addiction potential. Patches are hard to abuse and the damage they cause when they are is pretty devastating to internal organs. But on the flip side, it is a round the clock pain reliever and gets pretty good results once the dose is dialed in. I found them difficult to keep on, but a little duct tape works wonders. 

As a very general rule, and there is a lot to say for subjectivity which makes it all moot really, drugs that start with ""oxy"" are stronger than the ""hydro"" drugs. And like codeine being weaker than morphine, ""codone"" drugs are weaker than ""morphone"" drugs. So hydrocodone to oxycodone is considered a single jump in strength, while hydrocodone to hydromorphone is considered a couple jumps in strength. Oxymorphone is stronger still. Then you get out of the naming conventions in to drugs like methadone, fentanyl and buprenorphine, not necessarily in that order.

Its funny that you bring up a combination of meds. That is usually where people find the most relief. Opioids just cover the pain, they dont do a thing to address the cause. If youre having muscle spasms, a muscle relaxant might even be more effective than an opioid, but the combination will get even better results. So a lot has to do with your particular type of pain. Nerve related pain can be very difficult. They often dont know what to throw at it, so they try everything from anti depessants to anti convulsants, followed by the kitchen sink. The mistake they often make is substituting these drugs for opioids instead of using them together. It complicates the side effect issue, but  it does have better results, all combinations usually do as long as the number of drugs is kept reasonable.

I am very sorry that I have written so much without really being able to answer your main concern. Doctors can be totally unpredictable these days when it comes to treating pain. The best thing we can all do as patients is ask questions. If they want to change your medication, ask what they are trying to acheive. If they throw the ""duh"" answer of ""better pain relief"" at you, ask how these changes will bring that about? What are the advantages over what youre currently taking? What are the disadvantages? It can take a little bit of a grilling, but you are entitled to this information, its what doctors are there for. If they cop an attitude about too many questions, you may want to consider replacing them. Only by understanding what they are doing with treatment can you help them know if they are on the right track or not. Its better for everyone.

Now having made that Public Service Announcement on behalf of the medical community, you also have to be on guard against false information and there is plenty of it out there regarding opioids and their use. Doctors are not immune to misinformation and most are not above what they believe to be a small lie here and there. They will often tell you something is a law when its not. Besides regulatory lies, there's also a great deal of medical misinformation that they are either genuinely misinformed about or they actually prefer the misinformation to the truth. Things like rate of addiction among patients Rx'ed opioids. There's a small but very vocal group of anti opioid zealots who routinely publish nonsense, like 80% of patients given opioids will develop an addiction. To give you an idea of how absurd this is the consensus of independent opinions, including that of the CDC put the rate of addiction at well below 1% (CDC =0.12%). That is not a typo, our government health statisticians say its twelve hundredths of one percent. Why such a distortion? Most of the anti opioid zealots are involved in addiction treatment. By distorting that rate to 80% the taxpayers have given them over $200Billion dollars for addiction treatment, most of which has been used for advertising the terrible state of addiction in our country. Forget they are the ones responsible for fixing it and have failed miserably. Sorry its just such a miscarriage of justice and obfuscation of the facts almost all my replies seem to touch on this situation eventually. But it is something every pain patient needs to be aware of. You can't always believe what you read, hear, or are told by health providers. So tread carefully in your research.

Like I said I feel bad that I havent really been able to answer your main concern, but if you have questions about what I have written, please ask. I do not get insulted when people ask me for reference material. Along those lines, I do have a sub where I have deposited articles I think might be helpful to people in pain. A lot of it is devoted to proving how empty this opioid crisis really is, but I've also included some material for the latest treatments for certain conditions and some things that explain the complex process of pain in our bodies.

But I really appreciate that you considered that people won't change their behavior by reading this post, and gave a very precious suggestion - even if knows from most users - as reminder to try being at least responsible and making sure that everyone related to strong opioid users - partner, friend, family members - should always have Narcan at home or even when going around if you are using a bag. Lives could be saved just with this little action.

But the biggest killer is not fentas itself, instead that government made, and fighting opioid crisis with hard repression, to a point where ever people who needed opioids for their unbearable pain, were no able to get them from doctors anymore. And the few lucky ones, if they have anxiety issues or such, then it's automatically excluded that they could get a benzo scripts.

When USA imposed to chineve gov to put a blanked ban on fent-analogues (and, few weeks before, FDA approved Suefentanyl, 6x stronger than Fentanyl..), this caused even more deaths and people getting killed even more from the drugs , as well from the violence trying to buy something in the streets. I'm not defending Fenta analogues, even if I love them, I realized how strong opioids are killing all the rest of your life - you forget your hobbies, your interests, your friends, and the only thing you are focused on is about the next hit or the panic when you will run out of it. But at least chinese were providing pure uncut powder (the legit onest at least), and every strong opioid users knew exactly that what they ordered is what they got, knowing the potency and that they won't find any hot spot or else. 

So mexican cartels took over, chinese sold precursors to mexican cartels, but the way they work, and the fact they are shipping almost daily an airplane full of fentas instead of passenger, other than  not being sold on DNMs (since the most markets banned the selling of them) but in the streets, they are most of the time already bad synth with dangerous leftovers, incomplete synth - and imagine the cut after cut before they reach the street dealers. Unknown compounds of unknown potency.

Chinese replies to demand to """"save"""" the people in this situation, providing new strong rc opioid  with less respiratory depression risk than fentas - but anyway deadly to anyone with low tolerance. But at least people had the chance to buy again from trusted sellers such compounds, knowing what thy were putting in their body.  


Then they made the huge mistake of posting such insanely strong stuff on public sites - this caused a huge number of people opioid naive loosing their lives - and made everything worst, because the big dealers decided to buy from chinese and not mexican cartel anymore those stuff..but only with the purpose of making fake pressed pills and synthetic heroin. With the wide range of different analogues with huge difference in potency and effects, the situation became only worst, because those chemicals hat little to none history in human usage, causing incredibly horror Withdrawal other than killing the toleance, where after a long-term usage of those compounds 200x morphne potency (so 4x more than fentanyl), people running out of them would not be able to enjoy even pure fentanyl, thing that it's almost impossible to find anyway. And they continue for almost 2 years, unaware of the possible side-effects short and long term, and the high risk because the half-life of those opioid is much longer than fentas - so even a small extra bump, despite effects are vanished already, the concentration in the blood is still high and this small extra bump would trigger an overdose.

Believing those stuff would be around forever, they continued to abuse them, until few weeks a go all the sources vanished due a raid to most suppliers, not because illegal, but because violating the law about the ban of BTC.

People right now are suffering in the hell, loosing their money scammed from evil people who knows such desperate people would try anything to get a restock.

Please everyone be very careful. Think about people thy love you and the people you may have forgotten to love, the interests in your life, and take this occasion to taper down, or take a break with the proper pharmaceutical and psychiatric support from rehab centers.  
Is not an easy choice to do, but better now before will be too late.   
Even if those chemicals will be back, they will be gone again someday because getting banned in china or else.

I lived on my skin all of this, I lost close friends, and it's a bless I am still alive. It took several months to recover from just 6 months of daily usage with those compounds, and the first 2 week I was alone in the darkness and tortured from devils without a break, barely able to reach only the toilet and drink.

But you realize this only after you hit your head against the wall - and for some people, sadly they don't even reach this point, because playing such russian roulette of unknown compounds mix, is counting  a bless every time.

Please everyone, take care and stay safe. If you choose to continue with the life you are doing, it's your decision, but at least make sure you are sourcing legit compounds directly from the produced, avoid the re-re-resellers, and if you can't, then better take some risks ordering from EU legit and cheap pharmaceuticals or Fenta-patches instead of random pressed pills and unknown china white.

830,2021-12-02 00:30:58+00:00," BUENOS AIRES — O ex-presidente da Argentina Mauricio Macri (2015-2019) virou réu em um caso de suposta espionagem de parentes das vítimas do submarino ARA San Juan que naufragou em 2017, segundo informou nesta quarta-feira o juiz federal da cidade de Dolores Martín Bava, que está encarregado da investigação.

Bava determinou a apreensão de 100 milhões de pesos (R$ 5,6 milhões) do ex-presidente e o proibiu de deixar o país. Macri, no entanto, está no Chile, então a proibição — que não é total, já que o juiz considerou a possiibilidade de autorizá-lo a viajar em um eventual pedido específico — passará a valer assim que ele retornar ao território argentino, segundo o juiz.

Após o anúncio do juiz, o ex-presidente disse em Santiago que se trata de uma ""perseguição política"", antes de se encaminhar ao aeroporto para retornar à Argentina. Macri já havia solicitado o impedimento do juiz Bava no caso, acusando-o de ""parcial"", mas teve o pedido negado.

 A defesa do ex-presidente, que nega as acusações, irá apelar da decisão e a Câmara Federal de Mar del Plata ficará responsável por decidir se aceita ou não o recurso. Macri poderá responder o processo em liberdade.

O navio foi encontrado apenas um ano depois, a 900 metros de profundidade, com a ajuda de marinhas de outros países.

A denúncia diz que os familiares dos soldados mortos no naufrágio do ARA San Juan foram alvo de escutas telefônicas e de outras interceptações durante o ano em que tentavam descobrir o que aconteceu.

Segundo o juiz Bava, está comprovado que a Agência Federal de Inteligência argentina (AFI) monitorou ilegalmente parentes dos tripulantes do ARA San Juan com autorização de Macri. Por isso, o juiz considerou o ex-presidente “penalmente responsável como autor pelo crime de realização de ações de inteligência proibidas”, também atribuindo a Macri o crime de ""abuso de autoridade de um funcionário público"".

**'Doente, surdo e usurpador'**:** **[Disputa entre Fernández e Cristina abre maior crise institucional do peronismo desde a volta da democracia](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/2273-disputa-entre-fernandez-cristina-abre-maior-crise-institucional-do-peronismo-desde-volta-da-democracia-25200371)

 O juiz não possui nenhum documento ou testemunha que prove que Macri ordenou que a AFI espionasse os parentes, mas segundo o próprio Bava, somente o ex-presidente poderia ter ordenado tal ação.

Na decisão, o juiz cita o forte impacto ""político, institucional e social"" que a tragédia gerou. Segundo ele, o objetivo do monitoramento “não era a segurança presidencial, mas sim conhecer os movimentos dos familiares dos tripulantes do ARA San Juan”.

""O governo nacional chefiado pelo acusado espionou de modo ilegítimo os protagonistas de uma das maiores tragédias vividas durante a sua gestão. Isso foi feito, entre outras coisas, com o objetivo de antecipar para Mauricio Macri, quais eram os movimentos e reivindicações que existiam neste grupo de familiares"", escreveu o juiz na decisão.

Além da proibição de sair do país e a apreensão de dinheiro, Bava determinou que Macri não pode ""se ausentar de seu local de residência habitual por um período superior a dez dias, sem prévio aviso ao tribunal"". O ex-presidente também deverá informar ao juiz sobre qualquer mudança de endereço.

Nesse processo do juiz Bava, também foram acusados os ex-diretores da AFI Gustavo Arribas e Silvia Majdalani e outros ex-funcionários.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

853,2021-12-01 08:08:19+00:00,"It wouldnt surprise me if they did remove it, but how it usually works is by tiers, with generics being the preferred, brand name drug bein the next tier up, and then non formulary drugs which they cover to a lesser extent. In order to get a non formulary covered, you need history from your doctor stating that you have tried ""x"" number of their preferred alternatives. Last time I had the fight with BCBS they wanted history that showed I tried at least 3 (may have been 4) of their alternate preferred drugs. As to the cost to you out of pocket, its doubtful they'll hit you for the whole cost, but OxyContin , even as Oxycodone ER is not a cheap drug, but it should apply to the year's deductible. You can wipe out a $3K deductible with a month or two's worth of Rx's. For your own peace of mind call them, but just because its not on their formulary, it doesnt necessarily mean they wont cover it at all. If they cover oxycodone ER they have probably been giving you this the whole time. OxyContin has a very confusing licensing status where they dont really make an actual generic, theyre all generics, still made by Purdue. 

As to choices if you need to make a change, you know Xtampza is out, Butrans is a buprenorphine patch. Some people like it at first but there is an effective dose ceiling, meaning that you can take more than the max limit and it will have no pain benefit to it. People usually hit that max dose in about 6 months. I'd say something about it being ideal for addicts to control opioid cravings, but its a crappy pain drug, but I dont want to offend anyone that's on it and happy with it.

MSContin is just time released morphine. Some people dont metabolize it well orally. Opana is oxymorphone, supposedly one step above Dilaudid/hydromorphone. You should check if its still available as an ER drug, addicts like this one because its easy to crush/chew like the old OxyContin. It just goes to show there's not much common sense at work in their formulary. If they have the ER version, it might be your best replacement for OxyContin, its a good pain medication, but the IR version leaves something to be desired. 

Ultram is Tramadol, you'll probably find it pretty weak compared to OxyContin, even if its Tramadol ER. Zyhrdro is hydrocodone ER. Just a touch weaker than the OxyContin, but maybe not enough for you to notice.

In your situation, if they dont cover the OxyContin, I'd go with OpanaER. Its hard to say that with a lot of confidence since every body is so different and each opioid medication acts a little differently on each of the 5 major opioid receptors. That makes direct equivalent substitution difficult and youre bound to go through all the complications that eventually brought you to this drug and dose regimen. Hopefully they'll get you pretty close and you'll only need minimal tweaking of dose to return you to the ""sweet spot"" in your therapy. If your doc is good and willing to put in the time to write it up *as BCBS REQUIRES*, you should be able to keep going with the present regimen. It really does need to be written up ""just so"" for them, as they have some real boobs with no medical experience outside of a DEA number making decisions on what drug is appropriate and when. You may also want to get your state insurance commission on this to give you a hand if the fake doctors at BCBS really want to put up a fight about coverage.

While you are going through all this upset, see if your doc will recommend a better ER drug regimen so your choices arent just based on what insurance will cover. You shouldnt have to be reaching for your IR medication so frequently. Its nice to be able to take your medication in the morning and be fairly confident you wont have to deal with more pills throughout the day. Maybe you can kill two birds with one stone.

Kratom bindet an Opioidrezeptoren. Bei regelmäßigem Konsum bildet sich eine körperliche Abhängigkeit, wie bei allen Opioiden (z.B. Tilidin, Oxycodon und Heroin). Es bildet sich äußerst schnell eine Toleranz, d.h. du wirst nach mehrmaligen Konsum nicht mehr die gleiche Wirkung wie zu Anfang haben. Folge: du steigerst die Dosis oder wechselst zu stärkeren Opioiden. Es besteht ein enormes Suchtpotenzial, weswegen ich dir ausdrücklich davon abrate.

Die Wirkung unterscheidet sich, je nach Sorte, von euphorisierend, schmerzstillend bis sedierend.
Die Intensität hängt von der Toleranz ab. Ich finde man kann es bei geringer Toleranz aber durchaus mit Tilidin vergleichen. Bei beginnender körperlicher Abhängigkeit verhindert der Konsum aber lediglich Entzugserscheinungen. 

Kratom ist durchaus Alltagstauglich. Es entspannt oder treibt an - was es aber umso suchterzeugender macht. Bei falscher Dosierung droht Übelkeit und Erbrechen. Andere Nebenwirkungen sind Verstopfung und Magenprobleme.
