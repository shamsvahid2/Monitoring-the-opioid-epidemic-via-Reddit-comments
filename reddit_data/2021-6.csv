He was accused of passing off a counterfeit $20 bill.

And two separate autopsies, one from the state, already determined his primary cause of death was homicide.

Further testimony from doctors during the trial of Derek Chauvin had also determined Floyd did not have a ""fatal amount"" of Fentanyl in his system as previously claimed.

I'll repeat my second question that you conveniently ignored:

***Do you believe a criminal past justifies police waving the rights of civilians, and play judge, jury, and executioner, invalidating the people that are actually assigned to those roles?***

&gt;HIST. OF THE ANTIQ. In Greece, Sicily, southern Italy, political regime in which the power, monocratic and absolute, was obtained by usurpation and by the abolition of the aristocratic regime. The tyranny of Pisistratus protected the peasants. While tyranny had crept into Athens, it had also raised its banner in Sicily (Chateaubr., Essai R√©vol., t. 2, 1797, p. 125).
- P. anal. Carthage, which had become a purely agricultural and commercial state, promptly repaired its losses under the beneficent tyranny of Hannibal (Michelet, Hist. romaine, t. 2, 1831, p. 48).
B. - P. ext. Synon. of absolutism, despotism, dictatorship, oppression.
1. [About a person].

&gt;(a) Arbitrary and absolute power of a sovereign, a person or group of persons holding supreme authority, characterized by a government of oppression, injustice, and terror. Feudal, military, revolutionary tyranny; tyranny of Bonaparte; the excesses of tyranny. From that time on [May 31, 1793] (...) by changing its government, it [France] has only changed its tyranny (Proudhon, R√©vol. soc., 1852, p. 21). If it has become commonplace to say that the present conflict is a world and moral war, it is because it is terribly true. The gigantic struggle between freedom and tyranny admits of no other limits than those of the earth and no other end than the complete victory of one of the two enemies (De Gaulle, M√©m. guerre, 1954, p. 460).

&gt;b) Authoritarian, unjust and violent behavior of a person or a group of persons (recognized as an entity) in the field of personal, professional, social relations, etc. Domestic, religious, union tyranny; tyranny of a father, a boss; obnoxious, unbearable tyranny; exercising, undergoing tyranny. From a husband I had to put up with everything; but from a friend, from a simple friend, I do not want to accept any of these tyrannies of affection which are the calamities of cordial relations (Maupass., Our Heart, 1890, p. 332).The girls remain children... They pass from the baroque tyranny of the parents to the underhand tyranny of a husband (Chardonne, Epithal., 1929, p. 406).

&gt;2. The act of imposing oneself in an imperious and absolute manner on the mind, feelings, and will of someone; the act of forcing someone to conform to certain material or moral requirements. Tyranny of morals, of thought, of principles, of reason; tyranny of progress; tyranny of love, of memories. A social and conservative action, whose aim is to defend man from the errors of his will and the tyranny of his passions, in order to make him enjoy his true freedom (Bonald, Essai analyt., 1800, p. 9).this general ""bougeotte"" which shows itself curiously in the second half of the Middle Ages, the need to escape for a few months from the tyranny of daily misery - even if it is at the cost of greater physical fatigue (P. Rousseau, Hist. transp., 1961, p. 67).
- P. exagger. and p. iron. Influence, excessive domination in a particular field. Tyranny of fashion. I would like you to cut out four words from these splendid and charming pages (tyranny of the imperfect subjunctive) (Hugo, Corresp., 1862, p. 429).

13,2021-06-30 04:25:46+00:00,"I'm a former fetanyl addict, and the 2 things that saved me were kratom and meditation.

there is no surefire way to guarantee a good or bad meditation practice, and there is no universal definition of health or fitness.

the more you meditate, the closer you will get to yourself, the easier it will be to understand what keeps you addicted.

kratom, if you're unfamiliar is a natural supplement that binds to the same receptors that opioids do. I found this was a good temporary solution for cravings. 

as for options that don't involve more substance(s), I found going to a sauna 3 or more times per week does WONDERS for the cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and it even produces its own kind of high. this was another saving grace. additionally, I found passive meditation alone was not quite enough to keep me away from the pills all day long. the Wim Hof method, which stems from a form of active meditation, is another great way to produce a type of psychedelic high without the risk of substance abuse. I've combined the Wim Hof Method with sauna as well as the recommended cold therapy; both of these things (in safe conditions) did wonders to remind me of the beauty of natural, uninhibited thought. the reddit community [r/BecomingTheIceman](https://www.reddit.com/r/BecomingTheIceman/) has helped me through my practice greatly, and I am now opiate free for ~3 years.

Those that use as a result can easily doctor shop. 

There are people who go hooked on morphone 24/7 around here after a bad accident, got cold turkeyed once they discharges, and ended up going to heroin as a close second. Elders don't get talen seriously and all they do is perscribe a painkiller and they end up getting addicted just by following instructions.

Like others have said, use stool softeners since going to the toilet will be difficult with the pain meds. Getting to the bathroom and sitting down on the seat was really tough for me since my leg was locked in extension. You will need to take someone's help during the first couple days. 

Melatonin helps with sleep. I use a 5 mg tablet. Should be compatible with your pain meds. I was told I could use it with oxycodine and ibuprofen, but please check with your physician. 

You will likely find that you can't lift your injured leg yourself. Even on Day 7 I'm not able to activate my quads and lift my leg without support. Ask somebody's help to move your leg until day 3 if you need to use the bathroom.

Then Dalaudid 1.5 IV basil rate with .5 bola button every 30 minutes on 6/25 7am. That worked well but the Fet didn‚Äôt. Then as the sub wore off in my system that 1.5 became to much and I got low blood pressure and slow respiratory. I had to request they lower my Dalaudid IV as it made me feel sick and weak. But I wasn‚Äôt in detox. At 6/24 around 7pm I switched to 1.0 Dalaudid IV in basil and still .5 on the button at 30 minute lock out. I rarely used the button except to sleep. 6/25 I got a few hours of sleep on the 1.0/.5 Dalaudid IV. Then 6/27 mid day they changed me to oral only and removed IV. 4mg of Dalaudid orally every 4 hours but I was in a lot of discomfort. So later on 6/26 they upped it to 8mg every 4 hours of Dalaudid. That was last night and helped me get bits of sleep but lots of sweating and some detox. Not terrible. 6/27 this morning I mentioned the detox issues through the night and cold sweats so they suggested 15mg oxy very 4 hours. I‚Äôm now on my second dose of that and stating to feel some relief but assume I need time for the pain meds to fill the receptors and relieve pain/withdrawals. 

I‚Äôll take your advice so far and stay on 15mg oxy every 4 hours and see if by tomorrow I am feeling a bit better. I also have the option of going back to 8mg Dalaudid rather than the 15mg oxy. I just didn‚Äôt expect this and it‚Äôs been really tough. I have loss of feeling I. My lower back, both hips, left pelvis, needle pains in my left toes, left inner thigh, all while feeling detoxed and at best a 5-10 pain level. No more than 9 hrs of sleep since surgery.

As for pain killers, not much has really changed in say 100 years, Bayer first made Heroin as a ""less addictive"" option compared to Morphine. No doubt that especially the Purdue family (Oxycotin makers) were purposely misleading everyone, doing the same thing Bayer did  many decades before. No sane person is saying narcotics are a great option. Regardless it all comes from poppies (or synthetic versions) it's just about the right dosage, and sometimes it's the only available option (or should be) for some of us.

As for blame I much more put it on the government as a whole, mainly a mixture of the DEA, congress and other agencies. 

I mean look at the stories we see multiple times a year of the DEA busting pill mills, are we seriously supposed to believe giving all the detailed tracking they do of these drugs they can't easily pick out the truly corrupt docs &amp; pharmacies and leave the rest of us be?

As for the medical industry, seems like most of the older doctors are just fed up with the system and retire, then the new ones don't even have a honeymoon period of empathy for their patients, first order of business on the first visit if the patient is on any opiates immediately cut them if not take them all away.

One would think throughout the entire country you could at least find say 100 honorable doctors who care about their patients or former patients enough to stand up and speak out about how inhumane all these new guidelines, rules and regulations are causing harm to legitimate pain patients.

Not to mention given the age of many in Congress, along with the wounded vets, how many of them are likely popping Norco (Vicodin/Hydrocodone) or Oxy before going to the floor and voting on legislation to further restrict access to others who need the same medicine they take?

There's a lot of blame to go around, but legitimate pain patients are really the only ones feeling the burden. The ""junkies"" have a thriving black market, at least until they get something which causes them to OD.

As for my pain, I have had knee and back surgeries, a damaged sciatic nerve, and degenerative disc disease, which as of last MRI (5-6 years ago now) showed 3 herniated discs in my lower back. But the pain has become 20-25% worse since then. Also believe I likely have a herniated disc in my neck, but during the time I had my prescription and insurance since I already had Norco for the worse pain my doc didn't feel the need to check it out.

The reason I heard... people trust Pfizer (the maker of oxycotin, and loser in hundreds of lawsuits over the damages they cause) over moderna since they have more experience in vaccines. My counterpoint, they have the same experience in mRNA vaccines, they have both been tested and administered with very few side effects.",1

143,2021-06-24 17:53:43+00:00,This is very interesting. Some thing I‚Äôm definitely looking into. I did mushrooms in my early years before I developed a severe opiate/fentany addiction. I‚Äôm on Suboxone now. I‚Äôve beenoff fentanyl for 34 days now. I am interested in doing some mushroom therapy and have also looked into iowaska...There was a series on Netflix last year that had a treatment down in Florida that looks pretty interesting.,2

So you got little fuckboys with no balls that never punched a man in their lives running around with guns. That and a host of other bullshit reasons but mostly that and its also summer time. National shoot your gun in the air day is only a week and 3 days away. Welcome to America fools. Stop getting your silkys in a bunch and start living. Shit never gona really actually change.

149,2021-06-24 15:15:17+00:00,"Update:
Yesterday started off great.  I was peeing better and my blaster wasn‚Äôt hurting as bad so I didn‚Äôt bother calling the DR.  About mid day I felt the need for a BM and sat down to try.  It hurt like hell and I gave up quickly.   It made me sore and made peeing difficult again.  So difficulty peeing is directly related to the pain I am experiencing in the back side.   That said for the most part the pain is bearable and controllable with pain meds. I will say I don‚Äôt think it is as bad as a kidney stone pain.  With kidney stones the only thing that could relax me was morphene. 

Last night sucked.  I woke up every hour feeling like I need to pee.  I called the dr today to discuss this issue and am waiting on a call back.  I still think it might be a  UTI. 

I finally had a BM today and WOW.  It didn‚Äôt hurt as bad as I had anticipated.  It wasn‚Äôt pleasant by any means and the aftermath pain is bad but again not horrible.  I have taken my pain meds regularly and also take 2 miralax a day and 3 Colace so I‚Äôm sure that helped.",1

Se preguntar√°n porque odio a los pobres y a la puta clase media aspiracionista y a los pinches negros pendejos color ano dilatado es porque cuando mi jefe trabaja en su rancho antes de que se hiciera director de banco azteca lo violo un judio negro gay pendejo y se veng√≥ de ellos cort√°ndoles la verga a mordiscos y desde ese entonces los judios gays transexuales negros pendejos lo han tratado de matarlo en cada oportunidad que pueden desde que empez√≥ su gran imperio  durante banco azteca durante ese tiempo Mi pap√° conoci√≥ a mi madre que era una maldita clase media aspiracional y le termin√≥ robando 15 mil varos pero mi pap√° como el verdadero mexicano catolico que es la mato a esa pinche jud√≠a aspiracionista a puro pinch√© machetazo sudamericano y me preguntaran porque no mexicano pero es que en ese entonces en los 50s solo putos judios vend√≠an machetes ac√° en mexico entonces mi pap√° le hablo a su amigo aleman argentino llamado arnold heissler que vend√≠a machetes de Damasco de los putos √°rabes y se preguntaran porque mi pap√° lo conoce pues es que cuando mi pap√° se fue a una orgia en Corea durante la orgia llego el arnold y le dijo en un acento muy aleman y le dijo que si jugaban tenis y jugaron tenis desnudos y se hicieron muy buenos amigos de hecho soy esposo de la hija del Arnold y soy el padrino de su sobrino. Pero bueno como dec√≠a desde que nac√≠ la clase media los gays los negros las mujeres los putos y los chinos me han tratado de joder a mi y a mi familia. Por eso al principio cuando empez√≥ amlo yo dec√≠a que era solo un pinch√© izquierdista pendejo que le encanta la verga de judio y pues no vot√© por el al principio pero entonces en esta √∫ltima campa√±a descubr√≠ que era amigo de Marcelo Ebrard y pues yo lo conozco yo le financi√© el metro (si ese el que se callo) y entonces dije a no mames el marcelin entonces me puse investigar a amlo y descubr√≠ que era del pri (como el gran colosio como de que no kabrones) antes entonces decid√≠ votar por el entonces despu√©s de varios a√±os estuve muy feliz con todo hasta logr√© tomarme una foto con el  y estuve muy feliz de como manejaba el pa√≠s (excepto cuando hizo legal la marihuana y le dio derechos a los gays y el aborto en oaxaca) (de hecho yo ayude a imprimir los cachitos del avi√≥n presidencial de hecho mi hermano Ra√∫l construy√≥ el avi√≥n para epnkdknk (Enrique pene prieto komo de ke no kabrones) bueno en fin cuando llego la cuarentena descubr√≠ que el mero mero de la cuarentena era GATELL gatell era mi compa√±ero de universidad (y mi t√≠a es poquita la del barrio) entonces le marqu√© a gatell y le dije quiubo kabron como que ahora est√°s en el gobierno y me dijo si compa ahuevo. Pero bueno luego yo le puse el varo para el tren maya y me mando un mensaje mi ex novia maribel guardia (fuimos novios en la prepa) pero yo le dije que no estuviera chingando la cabrona pendeja porque es bien puta la cabrona y amante de negros he ah√≠ mi punto de que los negros y las mujeres son un pinche retraso para la sociedad. Pero bueno en fin me cogi a amlo (no de esa manera puercos) le robe el proyecto del tren maya y me mando mensaje Ebrard y le dije mira pariente amlo es mejor que nada pero me pagan un chingo para robarle al amlo (no puedo decir quien). Entonces casi me arrestan pero yo les met√≠ mi verga por la oreja (no de esa manera puercos) porque soborn√© a los polic√≠as con caguamas y foco üí°. y me fui a Acapulco un rato y me compr√© a un carro üöó por nomas. Y pues me dio COVID lami√©ndole el cachete a una prostituta en el baby shower de mi prima (estuvo locochona esa noche). Y pues casi me muero a la verga kompadres pero sal√≠ victorioso.

Bueno en fin regresando al tema cuando estaba en los yunaites me metieron tres tiros en el pecho pero sobreviv√≠ y entonces Vote por tront. Y ya me regrese a los Estados Unidos mejichangos. Y entonces gano el viola beb√©s de Biden entonces me empute y me dio una sobredosis de ketamina en el baby shower de mi hija (si ya soy abuelo üë¥) bueno despu√©s llegaron las vacunas y como ya estoy rucon me vacunaron con la de faiser y pues estoy escribiendo esto ahora. Como podr√°n ver he sufrido mucho toda mi vida y descubr√≠ que quien fue a matarme fue el hijo del chapo y fui a agarrarlo a madrazos al kabron me sub√≠ en la mamalona agarre un pinch√© cuerno de chivo me met√≠ un pinche toston de mota me la jale un ratito y fui a putearme al hijo del chapo y llegue a su casa y me culie a su gato y luego agarre a una prostituta que estaba bien ida de cocaina y la us√© de silenciador y le met√≠ mi cuerno de chivo por el culo y pues si sirvi√≥ ya no hizo ruido pinche hoyo del culo grandote de la cabrona entro el cuerno de chivo completo y mi pu√±o completo. Luego mate a todos sus guardias y lo agarre a madraazos y le dije que quien fue el que le pago y me dijo que fue un judio llamado Karl Schwarzenhauer y lo fui a matar entonces agarre a mi cuerno de chivo silenciado con el pinch√© culote de la puta y me sub√≠ a un helic√≥ptero y fui por el pinche judio y como era de esperarse estaba teniendo una orgia satanica entonces entre con mi cuerno de chivo silenciado con la puta y me met√≠ 3 litros de heroina pura en la verga pariente y la verdad kabron la traigo parada desde ese d√≠a y no mamen no se me baja y ya no me sale el espumoso. Pero me estoy cambiando de tema. Llegue con el puto judio y lo agarre a machetazos y luego continu√© la orgia pero ya no era satanica ya era cat√≥lica y ten√≠amos m√∫sica de catequesis mientras me estaba dando una sobredosis en la verga (creo que se me acabo el espumoso ese d√≠a kabron porque no me paraba de salir pura pinche alpura de la verga hasta que todo el cuarto estaba lleno de nutr√≠leche y me quede inconciente) pero bueno regrese a mi casa con mi cuerno de chivo silenciado con el culo de la puta y pues me la jale otro ratito pero esta ves me doli√≥ kabron pero como andaba bien kaliente dije FIERRO KABRON y se la met√≠ al culo de mi silenciador. Y estuvo mamalon. Pero bueno ahorita contrate a cuarenta y cuatro putas y me la est√° mamando una en este momento pero pues al chile kompadre me est√° doliendo un chingo kavron pero la mam√° bien riko. Pero bueno eso demuestra que los putos judios calienta huevos pendejos idiotas pendejetes las mujeres pendejas que solo sirven para darme mamadas y darme de comer los putos negros criminares putos idiotas labios gruesos y los chinos amarillos come perros ojos de alcancia traga arroz y los putos gays culo lleno de espumoso pendejos y los transexuales viola beb√©s que se mutilan la verga para parecerse a los lavaplatos con vagina.

157,2021-06-24 02:57:44+00:00,"Update: Yes, this was a suicide attempt. I also wrote a note and put it next to my bed before I decided to shoot up. The color is actually so dark because of the dosage (I eyeballed and put a big mountain of powder into the spoon along with so much cocaine that I shouldn‚Äôt have been able to handle). My normal dose always looks like honey, a light-brown kind of that you see in my other posts. The same #3 brown H. And is around 80 - 100 mg. 

I passed out on my couch and ended up thinking to myself how I even survived this shit. I also still had the needle sticking in my arm. 

I am very sorry that I left all of you lovely people out there worried. Believe me I feel very guilty about this. 

I tried to kill myself with many different combinations of drugs. Starting to from mixing alcohol and benzos to ending up trying it once with all drugs I had in my stash. My biggest combination being: Alcohol + Oxycodon + Heroin + Xanax + Klonopin + Heroin + Cocaine + Ketamine &amp; Lyrica .. And this being the most tame of combinations that I tried to kill my self
with.. (Again crazy amounts used and mixed at the same time) 

I always ended up waking up. No matter how I hard I tried. Especially adding up more and more. I never died to any of the combinations I tried. 

But this time I thought that when I shoot up a crazy amount without even scaling it. That I‚Äôd die. But again, I didn‚Äôt. And I really have no idea of how I was able to survive all of this, especially having tried such combos almost every day for about 4 - 6 years now. 

My head hurts. I‚Äôll make another post going into more detail if you lovely people are interested about hearing my story. 

And again, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm ashamed.",14
158,2021-06-24 02:20:28+00:00,"I had a slight bulge but more importantly I had an annular tear. They can be excruciating depending on the tear but mine ruined my life for over 15 years. In my case the nucleus of the disc (contents of disc) leaked out into the nerve bundle.

It felt like battery acid going down my back. This would happen for say five hours. At the end of this part of the cycle I would have the most excruciating pain. Both left me bedbound. No amount of medication really mattered. I was on Morphene for years as well as diladiud.

All my doctors said they didn‚Äôt know really what was going in. I flew around the country for years trying to get a proper diagnosis. I was finally sent out from Kaiser (don‚Äôt even get me started) and was sent to Dr. Richard Derby who used to work at Seton medical center not too far from SF. He immediately knew what it was. It was called a ‚Äúchemically sensitive disc‚Äù! I went back to Kaiser and I got ‚Äúwe‚Äôve never heard of that‚Äù! 

I had to wait for Dr. Derby‚Äôs article on the success rate for a lumbar fusion for this condition. I had to send Kaiser a copy of the article along with a request for a fusion for three weeks registered mail to several departments. Finally they had to respond and sent me to Dr. Derby for a discogram to identify the discs with the problem. Dr. Derby is private practice near Palo Alto now near Seton. He recommended my fusion to Kaiser and I then had Kaiser Oakland do my surgery three levels starting with L5 up.

I still have pain and take medication but I feel I had an improvement of about 75% I have a life now. I‚Äôm about to do a seven hour drive on Tuesday and I‚Äôm taking a little prednisone to help but no way, no how could I ever ever manage this before my fusion from a freaking annular tear Kaiser claimed was Nothing! 

If this helps one person I‚Äôve done my job with this long post. Possible signs of a problem annular tear can either be no problem or the worst possible pain (much of it burning, battery acid feeling and tickling) inside your body in which case as the leading Dr. Derby described in his article published on the web. Feel free to ask me any questions. 25 years of back problems.",5

161,2021-06-24 00:57:14+00:00,"Mine's got nothing to do with personality. I got sick and kept getting worse and no one was listening to me because all the doctor's tests were fine. I was sleeping all the time, randomly puking, chonic pain, brain fog, etc. and the doctors wanted to say it was in my head and I was depressed. 

Anyway, my doctor was useless and I figured things out on my own. I was diagnosed with post viral fatigue syndrome so many years ago that it wasn't considered to be related to chronic fatigue syndrome. (Post viral syndrome that doesn't go away is chronic fatigue syndrome.) Everyone was giving me bad advice about trying harder and pushing through. The lowest point was went I was close to losing my crappy part time job and I realized I shouldn't be driving.

Discovered I'm celiac and I have morphea, discovered low inflammatory diets actually make a huge difference, discovered the importance of pacing. I may not be a raging success but I'm miles better than I was and very grateful. 

I've never actually been depressed in my life, and I've felt at times that I had justifiable reasons to be if I had wanted, and I still wasn't, so the doctor and her gaslighting can screw off. And she did have a mental breakdown and quit, and serves her right. Maybe she'll learn some empathy.",1

The stories of how ridiculous it is in the states boggles my mind. The biggest problem I had with any meds here was I had to take a nearly full box of Ketagan back to the pharmacy when I switched to Oxycodon (I'd had a bad reaction to Ketogan) because they didn't want that many strong opiods floating about which imo is absolutely fine. We normally get our prescriptions delivered to the normal supermarket from the pharmacy with no problems.",2

I'd look very closely at any ""professional"" associations between Barrie Police and the Montreal RCMP (whose murderous connections to the Hell's Angels and Mafia families are well known; these ""dirty"" cops oversee all significant drug importation via the Port of Montreal). True addicts can be handled by the drug prescription system which is already taking place in Vancouver; see e.g. [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/drugs-covid-supply-1.5668370](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/drugs-covid-supply-1.5668370) (it's no wonder criminal advocates like Lehman would rather ghettoize the downtown into an open air Hell's Angels Fentantyl market instead of advocating for policy that would actually help addicts yet diminish the Mob).",-34
194,2021-06-22 23:42:19+00:00,"ADHD doesn't go away so if you were diagnosed as a child you would still have it. 

I was high performing in school so I was never medicated like my brothers, and didn't seek treatment until I was an adult with a career and 3 kids. Meanwhile my oldest daughter has been on medication/therapy combo since 3rd after trying a host of other alternative treatments but her father who also has it (yes we gave her great genetics) still has never done therapy or medication for it but has a bunch of life systems he uses to control it. 

Also there are other treatment options than just stimulants and even stimulant versions which are supposed to be less prone to abuse (then again so was oxycotin supposedly so I try to keep that in mind). 

I believe there is even a test now that helps determine whether or not stimulants would help. 

Anyhow if you think the condition is having a debilitating impact on your life and want treatment I would highly recommend booking to see a psychiatrist with an adult ADHD speciality if you have that option available (my daughter does for her psychologist but not psychiatrist). 

It is a ""spectrum"" disorder so levels of functioning do vary and don't assume just because you are doing fine that doesn't mean anything either.  I have an advanced degree, a side business, a career, and a family and I got all of that before my anxiety drove me to seek help and luckily my doctor was like ""have you considered treating your ADHD first?"" And luckily he did because it made a HUGE difference. 

Also it helps my NT husband has the patience of a saint and keeps us on the straight and narrow. Lol!",18

You say one mistake? We are talking about terminally ill people. They are already going to die. What mistake is going to end their life? They are already dying. Not only are they dying they are in extreme pain. Yet you think that they should have to just keep on living in pain. You tell me how that's not terrible? 

And don't tell me about drugs to ease pain. My mom was on liquid morphine AND fentinyl patches and was still in extreme pain. She was not involved with any assisted death but if she chose to I would have understood and supported her choice. 

So how ahead give me one valid reason someone in extreme pain that is already dying should be forced to live months or years in that extreme pain when there is no hope of curing their illness. One valid reason that doesn't include your personal moral code but actual facts.",3

I'm not gonna lie to you, the pain was extremely intense and eventually the anesthesiologist told me she capped out my fentanyl and she needed to switch to ketamine to make me loopy. Reluctantly I allowed her to give me a small dose of the ketamine and that helped with the rest of the surgery. But afterwards, you are going to have to push the doctor directly for additional fetanyl/dilaudid via IV. It took me about 4-6 hours of crying and bitching but the doc finally gave in &amp; allowed me an additional 24 hours on IV fent. You will have to fight like hell trust me.

The money that ultimately gets funneled to gangs and cartel who are soooooo known for being anti violent. That and everyone stepping on the drugs from manufacturer all the way to where you get it making it lose it's purity and potentially increase medical bills because you took something you didn't exactly intend to take (which happens all the time).

If your crack is just magically appearing out of thin air somehow and your smoking it in the comfort of your own home and your not going out committing crimes to fun your addiction than have at it man more power to you. Sadly that isn't the case for a lot of addicts....

I am in NO WAY saying that their isn't negative things that go along with consuming alcohol but I can at least assure you that my booze isn't laced with things like fentanol and it's not funneling money into gangs and cartel",1
204,2021-06-22 13:49:10+00:00,It depends on the manufacturer really. There's some that turn to gel when they're crushed and it deactivates them. But then others with enteric coating like MsContin (extended release morphine) you can suck the coating off or dissolve it in coke and chew it afterwards. But yeah OP just research the mechanism behind the extended release. If it's the gel kind there's unfortunately not a whole lot you can do except for maybe cold water extraction.,5
205,2021-06-22 11:58:58+00:00,"&gt;√â. Educa√ß√£o gera educa√ß√£o. Se deres dinheiro a um pobre iliterado √© pouco prov√°vel que ele v√° investir em livros ou na educa√ß√£o dos filhos.

Mas porque √© que certos povos, e isto ainda continua hoje, d√£o muita mais impot√™ncia √° educa√ß√£o do que outros? Porque √© que certos povos sequer come√ßaram a construir escolas e criar professores profissionais e abdicar da m√£o de obra dos filhos por anos s√≥ para o educar?

&gt;E achas que foram sempre assim ou o Estado influenciou a sociedade? (Exemplo, China com a lei de apenas um filho -&gt; ou apertas com o filho para estudar ou a tua linhagem acaba).

E o que √© o estado sen√£o pessoas que est√£o por dentro do estado? Porque √© que certos estados influenciaram a sociedade para ser mais educada e outros n√£o? porque √© que as pessoas que estavam dentro do estado acharam que era algo positivo ter uma popula√ß√£o educada? √â obvio que o estado influencia a sociedade. 

&gt;Dinheiro. Apesar dos europeus n√£o serem mais burros, qual a raz√£o dos USA terem muito mais investiga√ß√£o ""per capita"" que eles?

Mas regi√µes como a Europa e Asia Oriental e at√© o M√©dio Oriente j√° tinham sistemas de educa√ß√£o extensos e complexos antes de serem regi√µes muito mais ricas. Antes da revolu√ß√£o industrial muitos pa√≠ses europeus tinham PIB per capita (estimativas, claro) semelhantes a outros pa√≠ses n√£o europeus. Os USA t√™m mais investiga√ß√£o porque est√£o constantemente a importar os melhores cientistas, devido ao dinheiro. E? 

&gt;Basta ""ires"" ao Porto de h√° 30 anos atr√°s para perceberes o qu√£o diferente √© de agora, apesar da gen√©tica da popula√ß√£o ser exatamente a mesma. Era drogados em tudo o que era esquina, ruas sujas em todo o lado, casas que mais pareciam barracas...
O que mudou desde desse tempo? O ADN da popula√ß√£o? Ou foram medidas que o governo tomou (mais educa√ß√£o, descriminaliza√ß√£o do consumo, turismo...)?

Sim, as drogas, principalmente a heroina que era popular nessas zonas, destroiem pessoas. Podes ser o pico da gen√©tica, mas ""trope√ßas"" e metes te nessa merda vai te destruir a vida. Possivelmente uma das ultimas coisas boas que o PS fez, foi tratar dessas pessoas. Agora para responder, sim, possivelmente a gen√©tica mudou, dezenas de milhares de pessoas ou mais devem ter ido viver para o Porto nestes ultimos 30 anos. Mas o principal motivo deve ter sido as a√ß√µes que a sociedade fez para resolver o problema. E j√° agora, o grau com que tu √©s susceptivel a ficar viciado em coisas √© gen√©tico, tenho quase a certeza. 

&gt;Exato. Por isso √© que antigamente era na tranquilo bater na mulher e agora j√° √© crime. A n√£o ser que penses que isso tamb√©m √© gen√©tico e s√≥ h√° pouco obtivemos o gene de respeitar o sexo feminino.

Tens uma compreens√£o um bocado simplista do que se est√° a falar. N√£o existe um gene de bater na mulher, existem genes que controlam algo que pode te levar a ter (ou levar a n√£o ter) certos comportamentos. Para o teu caso, tens o exemplo do teu controlo emocional, que √© algo que √© influenciado pelos teus genes. Homens que t√™m pouco controlo emocional tendem a bater mais nas mulheres, n√£o? E depois existem popula√ß√µes que podem ter mais ou menos express√£o desses genes. Est√°s a entender? E antigamente n√£o era tranquilo bater na mulher assim como tu falas",0

Even tho i didnt use it regularly, mentaly didnt need it. I easly felt that if u would take it regularly, gradually i would apreciate the opiate more, and thats why (over a year now) wouldnt even consider taking stuff like Opiods regularly. The Habit of feeling ""good"" is one of the hardest Habits to lose, as it inevediably forces you to feel ""bad"" (normal). realy risky stuff, its just not happening with Opiods.

In my opinion drugs like these, are i no way shape or form even remotly overthinkable, IF u take these drugs, take em feel good, take em as you like em. If it comes to the point that u direct urself in a ""no addict/ blabla"" direction. Thats where u get problems.

237,2021-06-20 03:30:41+00:00,"Yes..Chronic pain patient here with multiple chronic incredibly painful conditions.  Osteo Necrosis of the hips with left one replaced at age 27 and right one 33% function non dead bone left) after last MRI, waiting until it becomes to painful impediment to walk before second hip replacement, been 7 years since first hip surgery and going on tough (cross fingers), bad accident crushed both ankles had to be reconstructed, really hurts to be on my feet for long periods of time and do my occupations take care of my dogs take them on walks etc, and come back home or do so much without opioids.  Also have Degenerative Disk Disease of the back and hernniated disks amoung other back mallidys.

Because of the war on pain patients and pills his doctors are afraid to write prescriptions for non terminal patients.  Used to take pain pills as prescribed by my pain doctor until he passed away after 7 years of amazing care and what developed into a close bond and friendship where we would have lunch together, I would bring him lunch and we would both eat in his office, amazing man was a pillot in Vietnam a black man and had was an MD as well.  He was giving me 1-2 30mg oxycodone 4-5 times per gay as needed for pain.  After he passed I tried going and calling everyone and noone would touch me because they said I was on too much...I was on his prescribed dose and never had problems with tollerance as he tought me to wait until you are trullyin pain and need the pill before taking 1-2 as that allows your body to reinvigorate and makes it so constant opiate barrage to the brain does not become your ""new normal"" so you start needing more and more for it to help with your pain.

I am extremely well connected so I was not about to roll over and be in pain just because our government knows nothing about pain and has pain patients commiting suicide rather than live with the constant torture I was not going to be a victim so I found myself a couple connections and called up a few I already knew, and started buying by the 1 ounce to 2 ounces at a time.  I weigh out every dose every time and take exactly that much and still go by what my doctor tought me.  Having a good connection and buying a couple ounces every couple months for 750 an ounce has allowed me to be funtional and live relatively pain free with the very strong heroin and good low price I don't break the bank or live destitute.  If you ever met me you would never guess that I used.  I dress in new expensive clothing everyday and well kept smell good and have a rolex whatch I have never pawned and a little gold and ice around my neck, I also drive a new mercedes AMG.  I work from home in real estate/ property management and have a very comfortable lifestyle.

The drug war is rediculous and many cops will even tell you this it leads to so much violence and conflicts between the public and police that should not happen, the community relationship would be much stronger and better if they were not instructed to ask intrusive questions and try to sniff out narcotics from people and put them behind bars for just a substance a non violent crime.  I shold be in control of what I put in my body.  Furthermore having pills for people around even if they were leaking to the streets was far better than the alternatives which is street dope often sold as heroin but contains deadly opioid analogues that are evil in my opinion..I hate them with all my heart and are digusted with dealers who step on perfectly good product and lace it with said analogues to turn more of a profit, its gross cut heroin is.

Thankfully I get straight from the mexican connect just drove in each time and have never bought dope cut with anything like that, its always very pure 80 to 90 percent and extremely potent so even with my massive tollerance I only weigh out .2 to .3 every time.  My preffered method of administering the drug is insuflation (snorting).  I find smoking off of foil a bit gross and shooting is dangerous but due to my tollerance I have before and could if I wanted to without risk becaue I weigh everything out and know my product its the same high grade stuff each time it might look different but its always the same high grade heroin.  Heroin is a very effective medicine and was invented after morphine was of course they claimed it to be non addictive or to cure addiction and of course it doesnt do that, but I cannot tell a difference between morphine or heroin pain relief or ""high"" wise ( I dont really get ""high"" just comfortable and a feeling of pain gone from my feet and sometimes a lightness in my chest.  A bit relaxed.  Thats all I want, all Im looking for, and since like morphine it has a very long half life you can easily use it just a couple to few doses each day and be in relative comfort from your pain and not need to redose so quickly as oxycontin and other drugs hydrocodone as well.

My story is no different from many other peoples, some peole use the drug for mental reasons such as depression which some studies have found that for severe depression it does actually help with some patients allot, but that is not standard medicine today standard medicine is divided with an ever growing majority screaming it is NEVER appropriate to prescribe opioids.  After the crackdowns on pills started Heroin use skyrocketed and people from all walks of life go to pick up their Heroin  all time from Lawyers to Soccer moms.  Yes to asnwer your questio you can live a normal life and be a heroin user at the same time, have been snorting it for years and no damage to my nose or anything and am as healthy health wise not body and pain wise as I ever have been, sespecially since I quit drinking which is the worst poison, legal poisonous drug that is worse than Heroin in my opinion if you were to be an alcoholic (severe) versus heroin addict (severe)  ALcoholism can be very nasty at least they are on par with eachother and a very ugly sight but again big time alcoholics die young and quick and old school older once get their brain turned into a ""wet brain"" and can barely function, its a horrible addiction I went through a phase when I was an alcoholic and would never pick that back up again was terrible, but easy to stop with will power and 5 days of Valium and another benzo administered while I slept...

Anyway thats my story but In my opinion Heroin can be the most harmful with those already suffering from mental illness who use it to self medicate or people who get addicted and can't face withdrawal and end up begging for money to get it daily instead of cleaning up their act and working for a living... its an easy trap people fall into and made easier by dealers who are human waste who sell bunk product for high prices keeping addicted people on a line speding all their money with them and not giving them good dope anyway or laced dope...

For instance I pay about $30 dollars eachgram, pretty darn affordable, and it is ten times stronger than oxycontin I just get H that will blow YOU OP away or anyone else who isn't opiate tolleranct as I have been for years taking allot of morphine for years and then oxycodone in high doses..

It depends who you ask, depends what they do, their financial social economic status, and what they define personally as a normal life or one with fullfillment.  I have a wonderful life and feel blessed but would be left out of so much if I didnt have opioids to help with my pain, its all consuming, so I am unashmed to say I snort Heroin, If I could put it in a pill and eat it I would except that method makes it very innefective something like 40% effective where snorting it is anywhere from 70 to 90 percent so it is known to be a waste to eat heroin.  Even though I majority get ""Black tar"" its some of the finest if it is that and even though it burns a bit to snort it has never harmed my nose after years of use, other forms dont have so much of a burn but for the type a get a harder burn just means its super duper potent most of the time.

Thanks for the question I am always open to ask its a question that comes around here often if you have any further questions or are curious about anything or my lifestyle just PM me.

Cheers! P.S. I currently get a morphine RX monthly but is so little it doesnt last me 5 days...really sad the mme restrictions they put out, they called them ""reccomendations"" but laws were crafted using them and doctors have been put in a really tight spot, I still believe you could never get prosecuted if you took on a patient like myself and just had all my records obviously I am in pain I need to use a cain allot of the time can't drive that long becuase of my ankles I just turned 35...

We pain patients need this drug it is the last chance saloon of strong pain relievers for allot of us pain patients and we were brought here thanks to the insane over the top crackdowns, treating everyoe like a criminal now who goes in for an opiid medication pain killer Rx.  I am tired of dealing with doctors anyway and found one that skypes me and his little bit of morhine while a pathetic amount from what I came from when I was in good care is something and if its only 3 days worth Ill take it, every month, for now, hopefully I can find a better doctor soon or pain patient coices will help to change legistlation or we will end this dumb damn drug war once and for all.",2

this guy is full on zombie like he is smoking fentanal laced weed or something and staggering around for 20 minutes in front of my house...  

he has his own house he could stagger around in front of   
he has his own porch he could sit on  

but he chooses to hang out at the bottom of my driveway which isn't very long and he is near my cars ... acting sketchy .. talking to himself and barely can walk..  

he isn't smoking normal weed...   

but whatever he is doing his aunt must be telling him to not do it on her porch... 

so she sends him a 50 year old man ... out into the neighborhood in his pajamas    

thats not right   

yes he does shout and yell at times...
loud enough that with closed windows and the TV I can hear him out there   
   
so far he hasn't damaged anything but I see it coming  

no the guy is not clinically diagnosed... he is just stoned and out of control

I can't talk to his aunt because she must be telling him don't get high on the front porch   

There really doesn't seem to be any other option if it continues but to call the cops   

but I guess this was a bad place to ask because half the people are saying I should go join the guy and get high with him... the other half are blaming me for the problems of the world...

There is a lot of investigative journalism and even court cases in recent years that show that some drug companies had campaigns to push the drugs while withholding and lying about the addictiveness of them in order to increase their own profits over a long period of time. Some examples of this are the marketing of oxycotin, Purdue pleading guilty of defrauding the federal government, other court cases against J&amp;J, Endo, etc. Also once you start looking into the international arrangements and agriculture involved in these companies procuring poppies in the first place, it starts to look pretty grim.

you are dealing with a known violent criminal, he is a massive guy, and could easily beat you up sober WITH handcuffs on, and he is on drugs that make him much harder to take down, even a bullet wont faze him until after the drugs wear off.

he resists arrest all the way to the car, dragging his feet and dropping limp multiple times, once he gets to the car, he refuses to get in, and has to be forced in, which is incredibly hard to do since he is to strong.

you push him into the car, gently, and he flops over into a precarious position, one where he would get injured if you stop too fast. you go over to the other side of the car and open up the door to push him up, and he starts kicking your buddy on his side, while pushing himself out your side. you and 2 others try to keep him in the vehicle, but realize even if you do there would be no point, you wouldnt be able to get him in his seat and thus wouldnt be able to leave.

you then pull him out of the car, not all that gently, but not roughly either, and put him on the ground. you then proceed to put him in the restraining hold you were taught to use, and you put your knee on his shoulder, close to his neck. then you call an ambulance to get him to a hospital.

by now a crowd has gathered, they are filming and shouting, telling you to get off him (from minute 1), which would leave this massive drugged up guy free to move around, which is incredibly dangerous, so you ignore the bystanders.

about 9 minutes in the guy stops moving around, but to be safe you keep your knee on his shoulder for a little bit more, then you realize he has gone limp. you roll him over and proceed to care for him until the ambulance arrives.

the officer did nothing wrong, he was dealing with a tough and violent person jacked up on drugs, it was unsafe to get off his shoulder, and wouldnt have saved him anyway (no signs of suffocation, although there was brain cell damage from lack of oxygen, caused by fluid buildup in the lungs, itself caused by fentanol).

juries can be influenced, biased, and when the media and half the nation is telling you that the cop is a killer, of course you are going to convict him, right or not.

you are basing your opinions on how you feel, rather than facts, its a dangerous thing to do, for you will eventually have an opinion that will lead to harm or misery (e.g. this girl is a bit crazy, but she is pretty and nice, ill keep dating her), stop it before you ruin your life.",0

A lot of the dangers of heroin are from the lifestyle or coming off of it. People who take so much that they OD rarely intend to OD and is a product of the lifestyle and it's illegal nature. Coming off it is super dangerous, fatal in fact. And in that regard, is objectively unhealthier than a big mac. So no argument here on heroin being worse.

But... the actual drug and experience itself, it doesn't damage the body. It fries the brain, but it's the same with Big Macs which also fuck with our reward and survival systems (arguably worse, as there are far more components at play.) Heroin is an analgesic, which means it blocks the pain. But unlike aspirin and other pain relievers [doesn't impact the organs themselves.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid#Adverse_effects)

In that sense, heroin is healthier. But again, if I had a choice, I would rather self-medicate with burgers than heroin. That whole 'death' thing is pretty hard to ignore.",2

ANY way of getting that dilly past the GI tract and away from that acid in the stomach and it is SO much more effective. If they give em to you oral and it isn't working, talk to MD. If MD can't fix, save that dilly and A) dry it out and crush it up and snort it, or if they are too watchful (I don't ever find hospital staff to be too much for monitoring if I actually take the meds) just try and put the Dilly's under your tongue.

also, i don‚Äôt think that Ross Ulbricht is innocent by any means, but i do think that he had an unfair trial, and that there is a lot more than what meets the eye with his case. i‚Äôm by no means an anarchocapitalist/libertarian, but i also don‚Äôt immediately dismiss them; i think ulbricht taught us many lessons, including:

1) purchasing drugs online is safer than having to potentially put yourself in physical danger by meeting someone who may be dangerous in order to get drugs

2) being able to read reviews for vendors (drug dealers) can also make drug use safer, as people can rely on reviews to find vendors who have product that isn‚Äôt laced, and is not cut (and is what the vendor is saying it is). this kind of safety is not available when you buy drugs on the street

as we have seen over the last 40 years, criminalizing drugs does not stop drug use ‚Äî it just makes it more dangerous, and leads to the incarceration of many nonviolent offenders (which private prisons profit off of). the criminalization of drug use often perpetuates cycles of addiction as well.

If you feel pain ask for oromorph and take paracetamol when offered there‚Äôs medals for putting your body through the stress !

When they take the PCA from you remember yo keep on top of the other pain meds paracetamol oromorph etc ‚Ä¶ I did not as under effects of morphine I thought my body was dealing with it fine ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ when it finally got out my system it was a different story ! Don‚Äôt make this mistake and you will be fine, get out the bed and into your chair as soon as you can after surgery! Try to keep a positive mind set aswell this is a good 70-80% of the battle especially while on the hospital (granted this is easier said than done so don‚Äôt beat your self up if you have a down day or period it‚Äôs natural to ! ) and be kind to your self most of all it‚Äôs a long recovery road and can‚Äôt do everything overnight / in a week but you will get better in time be patient (admittedly I struggle with this advice my self) 

As soon as you can walk around a little bit every couple of hours get the body / stoma active and also it‚Äôs the first steps to recovery.

The first time I seen my stoma I was shocked and also taken back because of the soreness and some of the surgery wound / build up around the base of it , this will come off on it‚Äôs own and PAINLESSLY so don‚Äôt stress / pay too much attention to that it will look rawer than it is ( well that was the case for me ).

I had my surgery for a aggressive case of UC  that has got worse and worse since last October and honestly it‚Äôs changed my life for the better almost instantly from being able to sleep again to my anxiety of leaving the house / being constantly by a toilet completely disappearing, but remember you will have bad days / low days these are completely natural and allowed take them in and move on from them don‚Äôt sit in them for too long or you may get stuck !

Also, I was talking about heroin in the comment you're ""editing"", not Benzos (although the benzos on the research chem websites are far more dangerous that the pharmacy ones).

Some drugs are more dangerous and damaging than others, if you want to go ahead and compare heroin to magic mushrooms, be my guest but they are on two very different levels and I'm afraid I don't share your opinion.

Would I advise someone to do shrooms? Sure if they know what they're getting themselves in for!

Benzos? Sure, get some valium or xanax if you know what you're doing.

How about the benzos on research chem sites? No, probably not they're extremely dangerous for various reasons but if you do, do some due diligance.

What about heroin? Yeah I'd probably advise giving that one a miss.

364,2021-06-12 20:07:15+00:00,"It's interesting you say this.

We just had our third baby a few weeks ago and I asked the nurse the same question as OP asked here and she basically said it was nonsense and literally said ""Fetanyl is perfectly safe.""

I was just asking if they had any special procedures for drugs that had such a low dosage and she basically had never heard of a bad interaction, which really surprised me.",1
365,2021-06-12 19:53:20+00:00,"Would it be fair to say that medicinal doses of fetanyl could regularly kill patients if not for close monitoring and intervention? Or said another way, if you administered the exact correct dose and then closed the door and walked away, what‚Äôs the chance that guy dies? And how would that compare to say a precise dose of morphine (or choose your own other painkiller)",1
366,2021-06-12 19:40:25+00:00,"Paramedic here. Out of all the medical professionals, we probably give fentnyl in the most uncontrolled environment. Its just me, my partner is usually an emt who is not trained to administer narcotics. Im usually in some bathroom or basement, or in my truck if I'm lucky. We still manage to give it safely all the time. 

I make damn sure that the vial contains fentnyl, in the proper amounts and concentrations. I monitor the patients vital signs and am ready to intervene if the medication affects them in a dangerous way. 

The main difference is that I know EXACTLY what I am giving, because it is coming in a medication vial that is trustworthy. Street drugs are so unreliable its not even funny. Ive lost count of the patients that thought they were taking one drug, and the tox screen at the er says they were taking something completely different. 

Its not just what drug it is, its how much is being taken. I use a vial that says 100 micrograms per milliliter of fentnyl, I know that's what's in it. A 'finger' of heroin could literally be any amount of anything. 

Ill never forget my first day of pharmacology in paramedic school, on the first slide of the power point. My instructor beat the following phrase into our heads;

'The only difference between medicine and poison is the dose.'",3
367,2021-06-12 19:24:47+00:00,"Can I ask you a question (or a few about the same thing)? My mum was on oramorph for 3 weeks, fentanyl for another 3. Ops, ICU etc for a bowel surgery. The hospital have said they're stopped it all now. How is that possible? Surely it should be reduced slowly? Fentenyl is brutal heroin to me. How can they just stop it? She's confused as hell, fever etc. Is that normal?",1
368,2021-06-12 18:31:51+00:00,It's not intentionally done IMO. Usually coke dealers are heroin dealers. Maybe they used the same surface or same gloves or whatever and got a milligram of fentantl in the coke. But that's plenty to kill someone,1
369,2021-06-12 18:26:21+00:00,"I don't understand why you'd ""routinely"" prescribe fetanyl. There are plenty of less deadly, just as effective ddrugs.Talk about shooting butterflies with a cruise missile..",1
370,2021-06-12 17:07:07+00:00,I need it to just bemposotube for morphibe,1
371,2021-06-12 16:40:22+00:00,We just learned recently that having 3x what was thought to be the lethal amount of fetanyl in your system is no longer considered lethal.,7

373,2021-06-12 16:35:56+00:00,"Im not a doctor so I dont know if this is true or not, but addicts told me that fetanyl has a long half life that lasts longer then the actual high itself. So someone will do fetanyl in the morning, and then at night when they go to take another dose they will take the same size dose but they still have fetanyl in there system from the morning so its more likely they will reach that critical mass point where they OD.",1
374,2021-06-12 15:20:44+00:00,"Just to add to what others have said about it being better controlled dosage and purity; another major factor is the fact people don't know they're taking it. Many people who die from it are people who are taking other drugs but have it contaminated with fentnyl. This means the people who take large amounts of Xanax (a physically safe substance, but not mentally dafe neccerserily) but it is has fentnyl (a very unsafe drug in higher dosages) mixed in they then die from that. This is the situation of most of the deaths by fentnyl and for those who used to know Lil Peep this is what happened to him.",1
375,2021-06-12 14:25:49+00:00,fucking slut i hope u overdose from fetanyl,1

377,2021-06-12 13:22:44+00:00,"Bingo it‚Äôs not 99% heroin and 1% fentanyl, it‚Äôs 50% heroin, 1% fetanyl, and 49% inert filler (all numbers are just examples, I have no idea what the ratios would actually be).",1

379,2021-06-12 12:55:20+00:00,I should also add that getting into heroin or fetanyl is a slippery slope to go down,53
380,2021-06-12 12:31:53+00:00,"I think you're missing the point. Someone who goes into taking Morphone with the intention of relieving chronic pain caused by cancer etc is in a very different mindset as someone who goes into taking Heroin to get high.

They are two different things! 

I am not talking about people that need pain medication, they are not in the same categories.",0
381,2021-06-12 12:07:46+00:00,So these Chinese labs have the usual legal customers and a side business to black market? Why? Is it more profitable to sell fetanyl as an illegal drug?,1
382,2021-06-12 12:03:55+00:00,"Opioid deaths up 30% in the US - morphine, oxycodone, fetanyl etc.  About 30 K year over year increase.  Due to LDs, the Rona hysteria, broken families, lost jobs etc etc.  So we can add these people to the murdered total.  

Fake News, Fake Gov't, Fake Science, Fake Commissions; no mention of LD dead, or increases in suicides, Opioids deaths etc.  Nothing.  UK alone, this must be nigh on 75 K plus the real jab dead of about 10-15 K.",9
383,2021-06-12 11:37:25+00:00,"Welcome to the club!  I got through it just fine (surgery part).  Doctor went over the meds, Advil, Tylenol, 2.5 days worth of childrens chewable oxyconton.  Swore up and down most people only ever need a cold pack and a tylenol and most people never use the oxy.


They released me after an hour and giving me an additional 20mg dose of oxy, I got home, fell asleep and hadn't filled the prescription and all the pharmacies were closed.  10 hours of agony later until I got the prescription filled.",2

386,2021-06-12 08:09:13+00:00,"And smuggling bulk heroin is hard. A kg brick is easily found compared to a tiny sachet containing 5 to 10g of fentanyl. You could smuggle all the fentanyl you'd ever need through the postal system easily.


So it's the war on drugs that directly responsible. Cause drug smugglers are kinda risk averse after all. So if a more potent form of a drug can be smuggled, they'll do that.

Even if none of the customers but the fentanyl addicted even want that drug and would all prefer heroin or oxycodon.",64
387,2021-06-12 07:17:03+00:00,"I'm not an expert on how exactly fentanyl works. But a lot of protein receptor pathways work in a kind of escelation pathway. Where on receptor gets triggered, which triggers the release of some messenging protein, which trigger some receptor, repeat, untill they trigger an actual response. This way a single molecule causes an exponential response. It's possible fentanyl activates one of the first receptors. Where's herioin activate later in one such pathway or one that works differently alltogether.",-1
388,2021-06-12 05:51:31+00:00,"Not to be a stickler but you‚Äôre saying full antagonists and it‚Äôs full agonists. Oxycodon, hydrocodone, morphine are full agonist. Naltrexone and naloxone are antagonists.",1
389,2021-06-12 05:39:44+00:00,"Being that fetanyl  is so powerful and doctors have to be so careful with it, why isn't it used for executions in the prison system? Do away with the cocktail and uae this instead Cheap and easy.",9
390,2021-06-12 05:34:11+00:00,"Hmm - that is interesting, when I have had kidney stones I found out morphine does nothing for me, same as Percocet, Oxycodon, etc. But I also have a crazy high pain threshold   so I thought the painkillers not working was due to that.",1
391,2021-06-12 05:29:37+00:00,Did u just ask a doctor who probably studied his science for 10 years if he‚Äôs tried fetanyl?,24
392,2021-06-12 03:25:36+00:00,"Ok, i am in a different situation, i dont have chronic pain, i never had an opiate addiction. I am a life long weed user, with some experimental use of other drugs, and weed is very easy to quit, in my experience. Then i discovered kratom, and i reconised the feeling it gave, it looked like oxycodon witch was a feeling i liked, but opiate painkillers had a warning sign in my head, and although i knew better kratom did not. I dont know where youre from, but i am from the Netherlands, born in Amsterdam, you cant buy kratom at the gasstation here. I got it from a smartshop, as a legal drug, the first time, then i found kratom vendors on the internet and my once or twice a week recreational use started. Some people can do that and other people, like myself, take graduatly more, when i took kratom vife days a week i discovered i wasnt feeling that wel on my no kratom days, and i didn't took it for a month. Then something happened in my life, lets say my youngest daughters puberty hit me in the face with a sledgehammer. And i started using kratom daily, and now 18 months later i am absolutely having the most difficult addiction of my life. And that sucks, and it destroyed the possibility of recreational use of kratom in the future, witch was absolutely possible if i never used more than once a week.
I dose by how i am feeling, using a scale. Often gradually taking bigger doses, to get effect. Drasticly lowering doses gives me mostly in two days better effect from a lot less kratom. And then it goes slowly up..... I also vary strains, not with a scedule, i just buy a different strain. A rotational strain scedule would be very effective i think. But thats not for me, to mutch order in my chaos.",1
393,2021-06-12 02:04:40+00:00,"Not sure if this is same as combat TO but seems quite similar. Some 6SIR mono guys become TO, go clementi node, then attached back to 6SIR (but still under clementi). They go outfield, camo on, dig shell scrape, contact drills from tonner, vehicle camo, fight ATEC and do ARF with them.",2
394,2021-06-12 01:50:57+00:00,"ime priors on painkillers are always approved easy peasy breezy if it's something cheapo like yrs.  i think they only really gaf cost and they're only requiring the prior on percocet to make themselves look like they're doing something 'to stop overprescribing'.  but then if it's cheap, it's approved in less than a day with 999 refills until 2099!   they set  low quantity limits but they approve exceptions so easy.

bcuz they make it so easy to get 600 cheapo dilaudids.  but if it's a real spendy painkiller, then suddenly it's hard af to even get 30 of em.  by spendy i mean like exalgo or nucytna or fentany sprays.  that's whwn they want hella paperworks. 

one ins made peeps talk to a special pharmacist abt tapering and risks before being approved. but only if they were over like 1000 mme or something big like that.

u will need new priors prolly if the dose or the number of pills goes up, but they'll be just as easy prolly.  and prolly new ones too if the medicine changes.",1
395,2021-06-12 01:26:34+00:00,It was a similar realization about fetanyl that got me into recovery. Only need to be unlucky once to die.,62
396,2021-06-12 00:04:51+00:00,"Too much to respond to here, so I'll just address two points:

Re: questioning - yes, because big pharma and [big American corporations](https://philosophia.uncg.edu/phi361-matteson/module-1-why-does-business-need-ethics/case-the-ford-pinto/) have always put the long term interests of the American people over their short term profits... \*caugh\* oxycotin \*caugh\* fentanyl \*caugh\* baby powder with asbestos \*caugh\* zoladex \*caugh\* paxil \*caugh\* wellbutrin \*caugh\* avandia \*caugh\* bextra \*caugh\* geofin \*caugh\* zyvox\* caugh\*  lyrica\*.... \*caugh\* [dengvaxia](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/05/03/719037789/botched-vaccine-launch-has-deadly-repercussions) (just add some international variety in here)

And you're right, Tucker Carlson should be ashamed himself for sowing distrust in an industry that spends $300M in lobbying per year and has paid more than $33B in fines over the past decade for everything from false advertising to promoting off label use to kickbacks to Medicare fraud to poor manufacturing processes.  Because [big pharma and your doctor](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html) have your [best interest in mind](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html) and [have a history of acting with transparency and honesty](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/) as soon as they recognize that they might have a problem. Why should anyone be skeptical and not trust the science and processes that got these drugs approved in the first place?

Re: government is about distributing money in best ways that support society - absolutely the government committed to fighting [wealth inequality](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/business/dealbook/federal-reserve-inequality.html) without any [outside interests](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/17/902626429/wall-streets-big-money-is-betting-on-biden-and-democrats-in-2020) and is working on supporting [middle class american dreams](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/single-family-landlords-wall-street/582394/) over [corporate interests](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/how-larry-fink-s-blackrock-is-helping-the-fed-with-bond-buying).",1
397,2021-06-11 22:40:58+00:00,"LOLZ that big Funking pill for just 25 mg of Prometh?? Da Faq...my family, thx for feeling my pain LOL you literally made me spit up my drink, you know EXACTLY what im talking about...you guys were the people who tought me exactly how fucking small a pill can and should be with the lovely 60mg pure codeine tablet, phenominal!!! But those 25mgers of Prometh, why!!!!?!??.   I can't whine too much, at least your codiene is AMAZING..i meen that lil 60mg pill is half the size of an American Oxy 30 which are supposidly supper small, incredible! 

 But why oh why for 25 mg of prometh that big ass pill, the size of the old OXY 80's more or less or current OP 80's we now have (tamper proof) and also insurence covberage proof just great awesome move fuckers...I have severe pain issues and doc had to rx me 10 30's a day because my insurance flat refused to pay the redicuous amount they charge for their stupiud tamper proof fucking oxy 80 that turns to gell if you add it to moisture i.e. snort or shoot it...at least there is not lil beads of nalaxone in it to deter abuse, oh whats that, oh they made that product as well effing disgusting oh well good luck getting insurance to cover that either..

I had to level with my GP and the Pharmacist that I was supposed to get 2 to 3 oxycontin 80mg and 4 Roxycodone 30mg for breakthrough pain, but they wouldnt coverthose damn party pooper pills anyway so doc had to give me all the instant release, which oddly I found to be much more sane way of taking narcotic opiate, it kicks in when you really need it, and wears off, giving your body a chance to come back to ""normal"" or not having oxy all up pumping through it, and you can wait it out until your really in pain to dose again, instead of this medicated all fay crap they are pushing for now these days in pain management which is terrible because it becomes your ""new normal"" within the first month of being on the new regimin of 12 hour long dosages...its always in your system so eventually as its your new normal the pain comes back and you can't feel shit when you take a pill well because its ALWAYS in your fucking system...pain managment was made to be better for short term meds to be taken as needed, my last doc agreed with this and fully believed it to be true he himself was prescribed the same as I was he hated the long term formulations they have now, ruiing all the good pharmaceuticals and now to make things as if they couldnt get any worse they have scared all the doctors they are afraid to prescribe even to people like me whpo have multiple chronic injuries/ conditions that are dreadfully painful, but I am not going to live in pain so what do I do, go to my Cartel connection and buy Ounces of Heroin every couple months...Ill admit it freely, its my new medicine, thanks pain managment in the U.S. right now have done a splendid job people blowing out their brains becuase they cannot live woith the pain anymore as their doctor keeps chopping their dose down, just got mine chopped by 25% to a rate so low of my morphine rx that I thought it could never get so low...lasts me 3 days!  

Anyway im no junkie though I weigh out every buit every granule of heroin and make them into the size dosage I take its the same gear each time so I know my dosage, anywhere between 15mg to 30mg heroin 4-6 times a day as needed for pain, effing rediculous but it was the first pain killer that was really effective back in the day that surpassed morphone..why it was made illegal I don't know its a very effective pain killer, not as if morphine is any ess addictive..Ill never understand modern medicine, or this clowwn world we are living in...

If anyone read my novel, thanks for letting me vent, also in regard to the prometh pills, I heard if you rub off the coating on the outside it helps cut down on the sediment in the syrup that I have a way of fishing out, but do a lowsy job so far of wiping down the Prometh so im going to wipe them clean next time and report back if thats trully the solution, because my lean is AMAZING I share my recipe freely, but the damn sediment makes it short of perfect, aesthetics wise...not if you shake it up, but a lil line around the top of the  syrup in my lil quarter pint bottles I bottle it up in is not a good look, I get most of it out but always just a lil bit o that damn sediment from the prometh pills...still lookign for a good elixir connect or phjarmacy that sells elixir I have UK pharms that sell me everything else but don't have the elixir...want to try it some day and see how it goes I think its fairly concetrated if I read the bottle right, its the same company that makes the 25mg pills.

Have a wonderful weekend all!!! 

pps. ill put down the meth pipe I swear!!!!(j/k)!!!",1

437,2021-06-11 12:04:54+00:00,"I was originally planning to play it by ear, but was leaning towards not having an epidural. When it came down to the wire, I had to be induced because I was past due and I had 0 signs of labor starting and my cervix was completely closed. At one of the baby's stress test, her heart rate was a bit elevated for a whole hour and my blood pressure increased. We decided to do an induction. It took 24 hrs for me to get to 4 cm dialated. By that time I was having pretty strong contractions every 2 mins. I held on for 2 hours until the doctor told me at the pace I was going, I probably had another 12 hrs of labor ahead of me. I realized I wound not be able to endure my contractions for that long so I agreed to have fentenyl through my IV. This helped for like 30 mins and I could still feel my contractions just not as painful. I then decided to go ahead and get the epidural since 12 more hours of that pain seemed a bit crazy to me. Sure enough, my baby was born almost 12 hrs after that. The delivery went well and I ended pushing for only 1 hr. I was also able to rest leading up to the delivery because of the epi. During delivery, I still felt contractions and pain so I cannot imagine the amount of pain I would have felt without the pain medication. I am 2 weeks post partum and have recovered well. I was sore and had some back pain for the first few days. That's all gone away now. If I had gone into labor naturally and my labor progressed faster, I think I would have held on and not gotten the epidural, but I am glad I did in the end. I will probably do it again for my next child.",3

But consumption of fentanyl would drop if supply of normal heroin and pressed pills increases due to legalization. So it would cut their profits.


&gt;Drug decriminalization will make it even worse because drug use will increase and the risks of trafficking are even less. 



That's not how it works. Drug use per capita doesn't actually go up much with legalization. Supply increases much faster than demand.",1

Now most of those deaths are from tainted drugs. Now if those drugs were legal and manufactured in this country, then vetted by the FDA. No one. And I mean no one would die from fentanol overdosing. 

Those billions would be better spent on everything from infrastructure to drug rehabilitation to police training to illegal immigrants to etc.",1

Ponto a ponto: O luxa n√£o sairia her√≥i nem se ganhasse com a bola rolando. Como n√£o saiu o Marcelo Oliveira na CDB15 e logo foi demitido. De fato, √© obvio qu o Abel tem que ser avaliado principalmente pela postura do time no jogo, mas excluir aspectos como p√™naltis? U√© se ele e a comiss√£o s√£o bonit√µes por causa da bola parada bem treinada, n√£o pode treinar e cobrar desempenho dos atletas nos p√™naltis? Se √© uma possibilidade do jogo **tem que ser bem treinada**.. Quantos gols n√£o sa√≠ram pq o doido do Cuca treinava cobran√ßa de lateral? Acho que p√™nalti √© mais importante que lateral n√©..

Lembrando que o Prass n√£o bateu o p√™nalti da CDB15 por acaso, bateu pq treinava bastante e o Alecsandro insistiu pro Marcelo colocar ele pra bater pq sabia que ele ia bem nos treinos.

Back in college I did a big report/presentation on this. Time of exposure is going to be the factor here. In every study that you will see it's someone exposed to 2nd hand smoke for an extended period of time. Sitting outside the pub next to the smokers is consenting adult in my mind. Let's look at the first study I found when I Googled it. 

 Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association¬†(JAWMA), the Stanford team concluded that a non-smoker sitting a few feet downwind from a smoldering cigarette is likely to be exposed to substantial levels of contaminated air for brief periods of time.

""Non smoker sitting a few feet downwind"" key words üîë

""But our findings show that a person sitting or standing next to a smoker outdoors can breathe in wisps of smoke that are many times more concentrated than normal background air pollution levels.""

""Sitting or standing next to a smoker"" 

While I could understand smoking being banned at parks where people are stationary around each other,  outside of a pub is a different environment. Just keep walking, hold your breath for a second if your worried. Sitting or standing next to a smoker at a pub is consenting behavior in my book.",3

If you ever want to message to vent about this shittt disease, please feel free! It honestly sucks, but since speaking to other people with morphea and getting some of them tattooed over, I feel more at peace with my body. 

I spoke to someone who was taking Methotrexate and it also made them feel ill with bad side effects. 

Find a decent artist when you do! I found that a few weren't comfortable working on me because of my condition.. I  ended up  getting a doctors note from a private dermatologist saying it's safe.

494,2021-06-09 15:55:18+00:00,"Thanks. I kind of guessed that's what it meant. I've been on pain management for years from a doctor botching a broken femur surgery that led to a failed hip replacement causing a hip replacement revision that has progressed to constant pain from my back to my ankle. My doctor wanted to put me on a Fentayl patch at one point that I refused. Unlike many, I refused and often told him I wanted to ratchet down on meds. His reply was it was highly unlikely that I will ever not be on pain meds. But I suspect the goverment regulators might think they know better. I keep searching for treatment other than major surgery, but seems like a wild goose chase. I don't smoke weed or even drink and would never do anything to cause a dirty urine. I have tried to cut down or not take any meds for periods of time and ultimately end up taking my pain meds. It's so horrible I can't imagine how I could live in the agony I'd be in without the meds.  Seeing the way things are 'cracking down', I'm afraid they might go too far again and cut non-abusers off like they did several years ago. I'm hoping a new minimally invasive procedure might help me. IMHO the regulators always go too far, one day doctors prescribing Oxy Contin for everything from headaches to minor aches and pain to the opposite extreme of clamping down so much that people in terrible legitimate pain can't get effective pain meds and are in so much agony they take their own life. 

Sorry for the rant, but this seems like a scary time for those in serious pain and that really sets me off. I had an in law who had brain cancer and took her life. I've always suspected it was because she was in horrible pain and maybe was not getting sufficient medication. So it's kind of a sore spot for me.",2

You're losing patience so much that you aren't even able to read?

&gt;Heros is literally an archaic word for hero in German, the ending is to make it a drug but by simplifying what I was saying I confused you, so sorry about that, too.

I haven't made shit up. I simplified what I was saying for those who aren't familiar with archaic German, something I studied for my degree in the German language. I was wrong, oh so wrong, in Latin (which I have not studied) that heroina is not heroine. Again my dearest apologies for confusing you so much.

Drug names are made up, and heroin was made up from the archaic German word Heros (hero) and the suffix ""in"" used for drugs. It's similarity to the word heroine is incidental with regards to it being a feminine term in other languages.

I've done the research, it was named in Germany in a lab by Bayer (the guys who invented aspirIN, cause Germans like to use the suffix ""in"" for drugs, or maybe not, I'm apparently talking out of my ass and made that up, must be a crazy coincidence, especially since heroin and aspirin were both synthesized commercially by Bayer within 5 years of each other) and the guys who took it said they felt like a Heros.",0

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

628,2021-06-02 02:47:15+00:00,"A couple years ago my main girl got busted on top of a felony probation violation (I was waiting on her at the time), so I didn‚Äôt have anyone to supply me for a couple months. Then I met a new hookup but he ended up getting raided after a while. I messaged him when I got off work but no answer. Then later that night I saw his mugshot and an article in the online newspaper about the raid where all 10 people in the house got arrested. That time I found someone else pretty quickly and because I was getting a nice amount they had me ride with them to the city to grab off of a huge supplier. I was the only one in the car with minutes on a phone so they used mine and forgot to delete the dudes number. I didn‚Äôt have a car and didn‚Äôt want the hassle or trouble that comes with dealing, I was strictly only a user (everyone is in prison) so I gave the number to a few people I knew. 

The easiest person to deal with was my previous plug who had gotten raided so after I gave him the number I mostly went through him. He ended up getting arrested for nodding out and falling asleep in public so I even bonded him out so I could still have him get stuff. When I bonded him out I also loaned him $100 to get back on, and things went as usual for 2 weeks. Then one morning I bought his last half g and sent him with $300 to grab for me when he went for his daily trip to the city (an hour away). He got home, weighed up everyone‚Äôs orders, and messaged me that he was on his way. He only lived on the block behind my house which was a one minute walk, so after an hour I became worried on top of sick. His phone was off so I decided to walk over and see what was up but thought to check the jail roster first which he wasn‚Äôt on it. I walk up where his dad is out back letting the dogs out, and he tells me to go because the house just got raided and the cops literally just left. I got home one minute later to check the jail roster again to make sure nobody was messing with me, and sure as shit he was on there this time. After he got out on bond he told me that as he opened up the door to leave his house to walk to me the cops grabbed his ass and raided the house again. That night and the next day were the sickest I ever was in my life. I had to wait 24 hours until someone else I had given the plugs number to got a ride out there and could bring me some. That person was overcharging me even though they knew I knew the prices and that I‚Äôm generous no need to rip me off. They were just serious junkies who double charged and then after a week ripped me off and sold me makeup. I had other people though that I trusted even less but they ended up coming through for me and didn‚Äôt rip me off or over charge. Those people all ended up getting busted one by one though doing stupid shit. 

The main guy in the city eventually stopped answering his phone and nobody knew what happened to him. Until I saw on fox that the police raided a house in the general area where he would have everyone meet. They found 2 million dollars, 2 kilos of coke, and 1 kilo of heroin, fetanyl, and some meth all in the house. Someone paid his bond that was over a million dollars not long before blowing his brains out in the street in Cleveland. 

I found some stuff a few times after that but it‚Äôs always this never ending cycle of my hookups getting busted and then being sol. I‚Äôve been clean for 2 years and almost everyone I knew is dead, in prison, snitched or moved away and doing good.

(Jesus Christ, I can't BELIEVE some of the idiotic ""suggestions"" on this Site!)  Please listen to both a voice of reason and long experience before making your decision, okay?

(and fyi-I change my patch every 48 hours too) The Fentynal is literally sucked from the ruptured patch via your skin within a few short hours, creating 'the perfect storm' for an oh-so-fatal overdose. So what to do? Plenty. As 'crumblingbees' suggested, ( remembering to disregard his ""cut your patches"" idea of course) beg, borrow, pawn or fund raise to scrape together the funds to see a private practitioner. It can't cost that much, and frankly, the medication that'll help the most is not only cheap, it also works beautifully with the Fentynal Patch. I'm referring to Oxcodone, which, when used in conjunction with the patch for 'breakthrough pain' (as I've done for years) is not only effective but pretty darn safe.

However this universal love was not quite the same for many other substances that are now illegal, these could be used to target, suppress, and silence particular portions of the population.
