&amp;#x200B;

I've been going to hardcore shows for awhile and in this current era it's pretty normal to see people hatemoshing (which is when people in the mosh pit punch and kick people standing on the sidelines, literally physical assault), venues that have been destroyed along with property like tables, chairs and garbage cans being thrown at people, and then the occasional 8 on 1 beatdown by a local crew. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then you have EDM shows (or big, crowded shows in general) that have a couple creepy, rapey people trying to grope women. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then you have people selling fake molly or fake acid that's actually something more lethal like fentenyl. 

&amp;#x200B;

From my experience of being at all types of music shows, hip-hop shows have always been the most calm (I haven't been to a trap show with the mosh pits and people bouncing though)",2

3,2019-05-31 03:53:56+00:00,"A few things....

Be careful(and don't go telling everyone online that last thing we want is for this to become common knowledge because it's so addictive). Poppy seeds and pods morphone content can vary greatly(IIRC up to 1000 fold). This means that you need to make up a batch and take a small dosse, wait a few hours for it to fully kkick in to make sure that you do not OD.

It can take hours to kick in so dose slowly until you know what your dealing with. ODing is pretty easy and the fucked up thing is youll be so high you wont even care and you can fall asleep and never wake up again so  harm reduction is key.

What gets you high is morphine and codeine. Because theres a lot of other similar chemicals in the poppy(like thebaine) the poppy tea can last up to 24 hours as the 50+  different chemicals all slow down the metabolisation of morphine and codeine so if you redose the next day take less.

You can form dependance really quickly on tea(within a week if you've never taken an opiate before). It's arguable more physically addictive than heroin because all the opiates that your body needs to detox and it takes a few weeks for everything to clear your system - so people test positive weeks after their last dose if they use with any regularity. the withdrawal is horrific, worse than heroin so you do not want to go there because it lasts weeks as well. once you have used a few days in a row then 3 days straight usage is enough to get you mild withdrawal symptoms..

Do not use it more than once a week. Even once a week is too much in reality but in my experience that's the most you can take it without creating any major tolerance or withdrawal. You need to take regular month long breaks or it will strart to invade your life. If you usse once a week every month you should take at least one week off. If you use more than once a week you should take 2 weeks off. Every 3 monthss you should have a full dry month (use 2 weeks, week off, 2 weeks, week off, 2 weeks, month off).

I would suggest you dont start going down thiss route because te chances are at some point your going to overdo it and your going to be very ill.

People will say it's not that strong but this is totally incorrect. I get higher from tea than I have from any opiate as long as I don't use more than once a week. It has a huge morphine content if done correctly",1

Investitii masive in educatie si asistenta sociala. Cand spun asistenta sociala nu ma refer la ajutor social, ci la oameni care sa aiba in evidenta familiile devaforizate, unde-i ta-su, unde-i ma-sa, ce se intampla cu copiii, au ce manca etc. Statul nu are in acest moment destule resurse sa intervina in situatii de mediu familial toxic care e principala cauza a tuturor problemelor.

Un exemplu concret din documentarul ""Toto si surorilor sale"" (pe care-l recomand oricui mai are impresia ca e numa vina tiganilor ca nu se integreaza) :  mama la puscarie, copiii de 14, 12 si 6 ani lasati in grija unchilor care erau TOTI dependenti de heroina si se drogau langa ei in plm.

Asa cum s-a mai spus, facilitarea accesului la educatie - transport asigurat (multi copii nu au cum sa ajunga la scoala), o masa calda la scoala (multi copii nu au ce manca), programe de alfabetizare 

De asemenea pentru parinti ajutor social si ce-o mai fi doar daca copiii vin la scoala. Foarte multi ii trimit la munca, la camp etc pentru ca nu au bani. Iar daca copilul creste intr-un mediu abuziv (violenta, trimis la cersit etc) ar trebui extras imediat de acolo.

Should healthcare be a right? Yup. What changed my mind? On one of my projects the elevator failed and the girl working the elevator nearly died. Slammed her head into the roof of the cab, her hard hat is the only reason she’s alive. They rush her to the emergency room and check her over but she has no medical insurance. So they were going to slap a bottle of oxycotin in her hand and give her a cane and send her on her way. Thankfully the safety man was there with her and stopped them, pointed out it was a workman’s comp issue. Oh, well now she’s getting cat scans, x-rays, a hospital stay, physical therapy, etc. It took her over a year to get back to being able to live a normal day without pain or a walker. What, the shitting, fuck? No one should be condemned to a life of excruciating pain and disability because of something like that. Yes, she did get the help she needed, but they were going to just send her on her way with an addictive pain killer and a prayer. That shouldn’t be the reality in America. So yeah, healthcare should be a right.

Food? Are you fucking kidding me? The government pays farmers not to grow things just to not kill the price of food. Let them grow it, then buy it and give it away. No one should go hungry in the US. Parents shouldn’t be having to skip meals just so their kids don’t go to bed hungry.

Housing? Ummm, yeah. It doesn’t have to be glorious or fancy but homelessness is a blight and the kind of apartments that would keep people off the streets aren’t going to break the bank.

Education? Is a college degree required for almost anything that’s not either a trade job or a minimum wage joke? One is? Then if you can agree that a primary education is a right why shouldn’t college be if it’s required? College and trade schools to be fair. It’s insanity that we’ve created a system that starts off young adults $30, $50, $100k in debt before they work their first day in their careers. Money that could be used in the economy buying cars, houses, and other good is instead being siphoned off by lenders.

A job? Probably not, but in a nation like ours, with our phenomenal wealth, losing your job shouldn’t threaten your entire life and wellbeing.

Is the government perfect? Hell no. Would I even be overly happy about the government getting this involved in people’s lives? Again, hell to the naw dawg. Would people abuse the system? Abso-damn-lutely. However, given the alternative, and lack of viable options the government is better than nothing. And with automation starting to cull lower skill jobs it’s not going to be pretty over the next few decades.  I can’t tell people they’ll have to suffer and die because the government isn’t perfect or someone might con the system. Of course, the government wouldn’t even have to be that involved under some ways of managing all this… why hello there UBI.

There's a chicken/egg argument with black men getting pulled over more and charged more but nothing explains law enforcement's approach to drug enforcement.  Check rates of incarceration for crack cocaine possession vs powder which is used more by whites.  Or the current epidemic of Oxycotin where white abusers are treated more like victims, many avoiding jail time.  Compare that to the ""war on drugs"" of the 80's and 90's.

it's a cruiser. subcap. it's a missile. the principle is known, so you can just _build more_. why don't you? because it's way cheaper to hyperspace ram some capital ship than stand in front of it

&gt; The force required and the amount of energy needed to power a hyperdrive to the level that could do damage to the supremacy is on the same level as a capital ship.

clearly not. they used a cruiser and trashed a dozen ships. scale that down and strapping hyperdrives to rocks kills a SD. so, no reason to build them so big, you'll just die

&gt; Why do you need any other weapon when you can build 10 death stars and move them around to squash any reistance? 

well, it takes years for an empire to build one, so good luck. it might be big enough to have its own gravity, but now you've got to hide it for a decade in case someone trashes the partially built ship.

&gt; They got an answer, realized why it wouldn't be cost effective to make use of and thus don't do it. 

it's super effective. cheap as hell to take out a SD

&gt; Is it to far to say that no one uses it because it does massive amounts of damage that most people wouldn't want to cause

yes. most people want to cause that much damage while fighting a resistance against military targets

&gt; Without the explination of how hyperspace works, how can we say that it doesn't work that way?

established conventions on what hyperspace is. HS isn't 'going really fast', it's jumping to some other dimension and popping back in at your destination

&gt; From where I sit, it looks like your argument against the hyperdrive attack is that why wouldn't you use it more often. I have listed numerous reasons why that might be. 

mostly coming down to it being expensive or mean to the guys in the SD coming to genocide you. if you can wipe out a fleet with one ship, why wouldn't you just do that?

&gt; In fact given that it is one of the most hated points of the movie

not really. i'd go with admiral danger hair refusing to discuss her plan, or even that she has one, leia being an idiot in the opening scene, leia force flying, rose being a teenager and trashing a casino, finn parking on a beach instead of _anywhere else_, rose assaulting finn in the name of love and botching the heroi sacrifice, or the utter lack of explanation for the resistance even existing. it's super lazy writing there: they're just retreading empire, poorly",1

 Dias depois, o presidente decretou que “o problema do Brasil é a classe política”.

 Segundo o pensador alemão[ Jan-Werner Müller](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/03/imagem-de-onda-populista-mundial-e-enganadora-afirma-professor.shtml), o populista sempre se apresenta como representante do “verdadeiro povo” contra as elites que controlam e pervertem as instituições democráticas. 

 Se estas foram ocupadas por personagens egoístas e corruptos, não há por que respeitá-las. Já em nome do povo, tudo é permitido: ignorar o Legislativo, desqualificar o Judiciário, desdenhar dos partidos. “Sou o que o povo quer”, já dizia o ainda candidato ao Planalto.

 O populista também aceita mal, quando não os rejeita de saída, valores e modos de pensar diferentes dos seus; por isso, estigmatiza e apregoa serem ilegítimas outras ideias.

 Entregue a suas pulsões mais autênticas, o populista fatalmente investirá contra a democracia, por ser avesso aos princípios e às regras que a sustentam. 

 Nem de longe é razoável acreditar que tenha qualquer compromisso com a democracia o capitão reformado notabilizado pela [ameaça de explodir uma bomba ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/05/1884033-bolsonaro-admitiu-atos-de-indisciplina-e-deslealdade-no-exercito.shtml)caso as reivindicações salariais da tropa não fossem atendidas; o deputado que, ao anunciar seu apoio ao impeachment da presidente Dilma Rousseff, [dedicou o voto ao torturador ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/11/1830577-bolsonaro-diz-que-ustra-e-heroi-em-sessao-de-seu-processo-de-cassacao.shtml)que a martirizara; o candidato em campanha que declarou que seus adversários mereciam ser [fuzilados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/relembre-frases-polemicas-de-jair-bolsonaro.shtml).

After a day of trying to 'force it out' and getting nothing, and in the heat of frustration, I took a double dose of the exlax (laxative.) I had tried one earlier that day and it did nothing so that's why I doubled down. What I didn't factor in is that it was 8pm and my girlfriend was bringing me my nighttime dosage, which featured an instant release and extended release. So fast forward about 2 hours, when my drug cocktail really hits it stride. I'm exhausted, and still pretty broken, and straight up loopy from the painkillers, but for the first time in days I feel that gut start to do its thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

On a good day, I was basically crawling to the bathroom with the help of furniture/door knobs/towel racks to land on the toilet. This was not a good day. I roll out of bed and try not to wake my girlfriend, the saint of a woman who helped nurse me back to health, because I knew what was coming was not going to be pretty. Hands and knees crawling engaged my back in a way I couldn't do, but I could army crawl. So I army crawl to the bathroom and manage to hoist myself up to the toilet. This woke up my girlfriend. When she came to check on me, she found me on the toilet, sweating, pushing like I'm in labor and she swears that I was crying. My memory of the hour I spent on that toilet is brutal. I remember being in intense pain, despite the painkillers, trying to push footballs out of my ass, which is really close to where my injuries were. While I had some success, the pushing and activity managed to open up my stitches, I didn't realize this until she helped me back to bed and we woke up in a pool of blood a few hours later.

This was a rough night, I can confirm the message above.",14
109,2019-05-23 20:53:37+00:00,"I was driving to work, the music was going, the traffic was moving steadily and everything was going pretty well. I change lanes. 

""Sir. SIR?"" A hand taps my face. ""Sir are you alright?"" I want to go back to sleep. It was very peaceful just now, and I do not want to wake up. The hand taps my face even more and I wake up. I am in my car. My left side airbag is deployed and there is something poking into my back. 

I lean forward confused and not knowing what is going on. ""Sir can you move? You were just in a wreck. Are you able to move?"" I look at him confused. I cant see and everything is fuzzy. I realize my glasses are not on my face. I ask what happened several times. Im told by an off duty fire fighter that I was in a car accident and I need to remain in my car and turn it off. 

I ask where my glasses and phone are. He finds my phone but cant find my glasses. I call my boss and let him know, although I am very incoherent and slurring my words. If not for the blaring sirens he would have thought I was drunk. I climb out of the car against the protests of the two guys talking to me and quickly stumble into the oncoming traffic lanes. 

Im grabbed by the off duty firefighter and pulled over to the hood of my car. Im in no pain at all at this point. I feel great in fact. I honestly feel like I could run to work if I wanted to, but the off duty firefighter makes me sit on the hood of my car. 

The police arrive and start asking me questions only to instantly stop when my answers make zero sense. Fire and amublance arrives and I refuse to go with them. Police state that I am not able to deny service as I have an obvious head injury. 

The paramedics are check where I am bleeding from and state that all of them are superficial. I am dizzy and stumbling so they load me into the ambulance and take me to the hospital. 

They wheel me into the hospital and a team of individuals start checking everything. My blood pressure is very high as well as my heart rate. At this moment, I am noticing everything is hurting. It was strange as nothing hurt before. They tell me I am going to be put on fentanol. 

The nurses ask what kind of car I drove and I told her mine. She asked how I liked it and I jokingly said that if I had no broken bones it has my seal of approval. 

They take blood work and wheel me in for an MRI for my chest and head. They need to make sure I have no head injuries outside of my concussion. 

I am wheeled back to the room where the emergency level of urgency is gone and everyone is more lazily walking around and checking my stats. 

A police officer comes in and asks me if there is someone he can contact to collect my guns. He wanted to be nice and hand them off to a relative or friend instead of taking them to property. 

I give him the info and he leaves. The doctor comes back in and informs me that there is no major injuries, no broken bones, no cracked ribs, and nothing shows on the MRI. But they did inform me that my blood sugar was over 300... Asked me if I had been having to pee a lot recently, if I was suddenly finding myself more hungry, and if I find myself thirstier than usual. 

Yes to all 3. 

I let her know I need to use the restroom and they offer a bed pan. I refuse stating I want to walk. Holy shit. EVERYTHING hurt. My knees, my legs, my arms, my neck, and my feet ALL hurt. 

I use the restroom and come back to find my parents in the room. I do not remember calling them, but apparently I did according to my call log.",12

Os nomes foram divulgados nesta terça (21)

 ​A inclusão do camisa 10 do Barcelona já era esperada. Ele disputou apenas uma partida pela seleção após a Copa do Mundo do ano passado (derrota em[ amistoso contra a Venezuela](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/03/argentina-perde-para-a-venezuela-na-volta-de-messi-a-selecao.shtml)), mas já tinha avisado a Scaloni que estava à disposição para o torneio.

 Dos que estiveram na Copa, [Javier ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/06/porta-voz-da-geracao-messi-mascherano-tenta-ressuscitar-a-argentina.shtml)[Mascherano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/06/porta-voz-da-geracao-messi-mascherano-tenta-ressuscitar-a-argentina.shtml) e Lucas Biglia se aposentaram da seleção e pediram para não serem chamados mais. 

 Será no Brasil que a Argentina tentará [quebrar um jejum](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/05/argentina-tenta-acabar-com-jejum-de-25-anos-sem-titulos.shtml) de 26 anos sem a conquista de um título de expressão. O último foi em 1993, na Copa América do Equador. Lionel Messi precisa também do título para evitar as cobranças que quase já o fizeram desistir da seleção. Ele faz parte da equipe que foi vice das Copas Américas de 2015 e 2016 e da [Copa do Mundo de 2014](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/folhanacopa/2014/07/1485381-com-gol-na-prorrogacao-alemanha-bate-argentina-e-conquista-o-tetra.shtml). Ele também estava no elenco em 2007, quando a equipe foi derrotada pelo Brasil na decisão, embora fosse uma geração anterior à atual.

 A maior surpresa da lista foi a convocação do lateral Milton Casco, do River Plate. Ele não havia sido citado por Scaloni nenhuma vez e entrou no lugar de Gabriel Mercado, do Sevilla-ESP, que era titular da posição. Outro nome pouco esperado era o zagueiro Juan Foyth, do [Tottenham ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/lucas-faz-tres-vira-heroi-e-leva-o-tottenham-a-final-da-champions.shtml)[Hotspur-ING](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/lucas-faz-tres-vira-heroi-e-leva-o-tottenham-a-final-da-champions.shtml). Mas como disputará a final da Champions League em 1 de junho, ele só vai se apresentar à seleção em cima da hora para o torneio. 

 Também chamou a atenção a presença do lateral Saraiva, do Racing, e a ausência de Mauro Icardi, artilheiro da Internazionale. Ele era a principal dúvida da convocação. 

 A Copa América acontece de 14 de junho a 7 de julho e as partidas vão acontecer em São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte e Salvador.

 A Argentina está no grupo B com Qatar, Colômbia e Paraguai. A estreia será em 15 de junho, contra os colombianos. É um dos quatro jogos do torneio que estão com [ingressos esgotados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/cerca-de-450-mil-ingressos-para-a-copa-america-ja-foram-vendidos.shtml).

 Depois disso, a equipe enfrenta o Paraguai, em 19 de junho, no Mineirão, e o Qatar, dia 23, em Porto Alegre.

For example, getting into the business at 18 is waaay to old to remain competitive   
Also your career has to start simple before you blaze of into the nightsky filled with thousand tiny specks of cocaine  
So we´ll start slow, smoking our first joint at 15 with a good friend some afternoon after you came from school  
Then, maybe a year later, somebody suggests popping a pill of mdma oder snorting a few lines amphetamine at some party, and you think to yourself:  
""Well that doesnt sound bad, why not?""  
Surprise! You were right. It was way more fun than you imagined beforehand  
But the problem with mdma is that you should wait at least 2 months before taking another dose, so for the next year we need to find something else to do  
Luckily by that time we made a new friend who is pretty enthusiastic about psychedelic drugs and we had a nice warm summer where on a few weekends the sky was not only filled with clouds and airplanes, but also with colorful hallucinations of sibirian tigers.  
Someday while tripping your friend informs you that he has a few pills of Xanax for the emergency of a bad trip  
This emergency never became reality, but somehow you took them anyway a few days later, ""Just to see how it feels""  
Well another years goes by, you finally turned 18, and in the meantime you found out that benzodiazepines like Xanax are not quite your thing, on the other hand you found out that you absolutely love strong opioides, like Oxycodon or Fentanyl  
Its around this time where you start taking cocaine with a friend of yours, out of pure boredom and the lack of other drugs  
And its somewhat logical too, when your days are a rollercoasterride composed of constantly smoking weed, attending parties for 72h straight, with a good amount of speed and mdma, then curing the hangover with  strong painkillers only so you can be ""ready"" to take excessive amounts of LSD with your friends  
When you live in that reality a little bit of cocaine isnt much of  problem

139,2019-05-21 04:14:24+00:00,"I agree in the case of people who are terminally ill and in pain. In other cases... It's complicated. Because we're talking about mental illness. I've... Well, I've had suicidal ideation without intention. There are a few reasons I've never had intention, but it boils down to, I have the presence of mind to know that I probably will feel better someday, even if I don't feel like that's true, and two, I'm too afraid of death. That last one has been kind of a safe-guard, because there was one time in my life where I could not imagine getting through it. But I'm glad it worked out that way, because I would've missed out on so much.

That's the thing with suicide -- it's usually not a rational decision. Depression colors your thinking, makes you feel unrealistically hopeless. A lot, if not most, people who have tried or thought out about it are later really glad they didn't succeed. Not to mention, the loss of a fully developed person is going to cause their loved ones pain.

However, I believe there are exceptions. My mother killed herself and... She'd always had issues with depression and anxiety, but toward the end, her brain chemistry got fucked from a bad interaction with her anti-depressant (she was on the MAO-I Nardil, and someone at the hospital gave her a fentonyl patch after surgery, for anyone who's wondering). After that, she could no longer take that anti-depressant, and nothing else worked for her. She was in a horrible state of anxiety that I actually could relate to, despite the fact that mine had been more circumstantial. For about a year, she just sat around the house, barely spoke or ate or bathed. I really don't think suicide was wrong in her case. You could say that it was hurtful to her loved ones, but I think it's selfish to ask someone to stick around for your sake in a case like that.

Started to be a duller pain. Then I made the mistake of going to physio. The day after physio it was so much worse. The day after that I couldn't get out of bed. For 6 weeks. Mri showed I had one disc 50% out of place likely caused by the physio. After 5 weeks I couldn't stand the pain anymore and ended up calling an ambulance.

The first hour of the movie is Shrek finding whoever sold them the drugs. After discovering it was Donkey, he beats him almost to death but then he finds forgiveness. Donkey, in a fit of rage tells Shrek he blames him for his downfall to selling drugs, and he would've done that again if it gave him money. Shrek smashed Donkey's head in a graphic scene. 

After learning what Shrek did, Fiona leaves Shrek and he is left alone in his swamp. Gingy and Pinocchio are hired by a mysterious person to kill Shrek. In their failed attempt Shrek catches Pinocchio and tortures him until he reveals the location of their employer. Shrek reaches the castle from the first Shrek movie and finds out the person who hired them is none other than the Dragon, Donkey's wife. Shrek fights the dragon and loses and the Dragon drowns him in lava to his death. 

In an after-credits scene, Fiona is seen using the tesseract to revive Shrek with the help of Howard Stark who's been brought by Puss in Boots through space and time, setting up for the OCU: The Ogre Cinematic Universe.",5

162,2019-05-18 22:22:13+00:00,"El tema sobre el uso de drogas debería estar abordado en políticas de prevención desde una linea de gestión social sobre las razones, los limites y riesgos futuros (salud) que caracterizan y muchas veces diferencian a los consumidores. Si bien gran porcentaje de consumidores hacen un uso ""abusivo"" de las drogas, es decir, un consumo excesivo que resulta en dependencia e incremento en la probabilidad de arriesgar su vida, hay un punto que el mismo sistema requiere que la persona aun consuma, ya no siendo una opción por parte del consumidor. Por el contrario, existen otros tipos de consumidores que aun tienen control y decisión racional, los cuales pueden solo llegar a hacer uso su primera vez por curiosidad, otros ocasionalmente con dosis muy pequeñas para generar en su cuerpo euforia para incrementar la diversión en ese momento.

Es así que las políticas preventivas deben estar dirigidas a consumidores que se encuentran en esos limites que por situaciones particulares entren a la etapa de dependencia pues actualmente la mayoría conoce los riesgos generales antes de hacer su primer consumo, el problema muchas veces es cuando el consumidor se justifica en que el consumo trae mas beneficios sobre las consecuencias a futuro. Una forma directa de desarrollar un dialogo y apoyo coordinado por parte de la comunidad con el consumidor dependiente inicia a partir de la desestigmatización del consumidor y reconocerlo como un ciudadano con derechos,  reconociendo su autonomía y libertad, siendo posicionados como actores sociales en la búsqueda de la inclusión social, entendiendo como la aceptación y respeto por sus ideas y no especificando como se debe comportar.

A partir de la película, lo anterior se observa en la presentación inicial de los personajes y al final cuando se describe los estereotipos que deben tener los jóvenes de Reino Unido, un contexto que señala ciudadanos con vidas monótonas, materialistas, cegados por la televisión y un sistema financiero esclavista, factores de los cuales buscan escapar, eliminar el aburrimiento o dar sentido a la vida. Pero, sigue quedando la decisión en manos del consumidor de como darle sentido a su vida, si seguir lo planteado por la sociedad, los riesgos de la droga (Muerte de Tommy o el bebe de Allison)  o encontrar un nuevo camino con otras formas de experimentar que le den diversión y evitar la monotonía (Renton). Ahora bien, no solo la decisión determina dejar el consumo, debe haber un apoyo de la sociedad sea la familia, los amigos, instituciones (sustitución de la heroína y seguimiento de la corte luego de los constantes robos)  o externalidades (la venta de la heroina) que den ese ultimo impulso.",1

Respuesta un poco más larga: hace menos de 20 años que el e-cig está siendo consumido masivamente en el mercado así que no tenemos ni idea qué puede pasar a largo plazo.

Pero lo que sí encontraron es que algunos bastante berretas tienen las resistencias de metales chotos y eso te puede hacer mal. Además en ciertos cartuchos encontraron formaldehído, que se encuentra también en el cigarro convencional y es carcinogénico.

Sumado a esto el componente nicotina sigue estando y es una sustancia mucho más adictiva que la heroina y la cocaina. Aunque hayan líquidos sin nicotina, no se que porcentaje de la gente los elige porque, de nuevo, no hay datos suficientes.

The first thing you need to know is what is an opiate? It is a drug derived from opium. Opium contains two main groups of alkaloids. Phenanthrenes such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine are the main psychoactive constituents. Once ingested, an overload of dopamine is released into your receptors in the brain. Every being loves dopamine, its one of the main feel good about yourself feelings. 
So now imagine your brain (non opiate user), you get those little boost of dopamine coming usually when you do something productive and something that you feel accomplished with. Examples would be like opening the door for a stranger, taking care of your hygiene, finishing a good day at work, the feeling you get after cleaning or the feeling after a good workout. Remember this is just my experience and my opinion of my journey thus far as a opiate addict. Now when i first tried percocets and oxcodone, i had an overload of dopamine rush into my brain. Holy fuck did that feel great, and i didnt even have to do anything to achieve it that feeling. Its like doing all the examples that i gave you earlier times 10! And so i was in denial and too proud with an inflated ego at the begining of my using career. 
One of the problems with opiates is for all that overload of dopamine, you will have to pay back in hell to feel normal. But the thing is, ""normal"" doesnt exist anymore, i created a memory in my brain that was untouched before.
It took me 10 years to figure out that its ok to be where im at right now in my recovery and realize how life sucking that drug is. It has literally taken everything from me. But im alive today and grateful for every breathe i have today. 
Weird considering I wanted to kill myself 2 weeks ago due to me feeling tired of feeling like a failure and a burden to everyone including myself. I didnt see a way out, thankfully that was what created the begining of my first ever ego death.
Opiates disconnects reality from my conscious thoughts and i had to do anything to survive(use and not get sick). There is a way out though, ego death has helped me realize how important life is. For that im grateful, the other thing im extremely grateful for is all the support i have including my family. If it wasnt for them i dont think id be alive today. I know it must be tough to be on the sidelines of his life but try to never give up on an addict, just try to set boundaries and have open communication with no judgement or guilt. The real him or her does not like doing opiates and being the ""addict"" version of his being. At his or her inner most self, no one decides to be an addict. It is a disease, and once it is caught it needs to be managed daily for the rest of our lives just like diabetes.
Recovery can be fluid but the goal will always remain the same (recovery). So whatever it takes to get there, do it. 
I wish you good luck with everything, theres lots of good comments here so hopefully you can kinda see how serious this shit is. I know the rate of success for him to recover with reduce immemsely if familly pulls out support. But then again Im not in your shoes. Just know the ""addict""  version of him is not him and that his inner child is screaming and hurting inside wanting help but the ""addict"" in him suppresses that and hijacks the brain till you detox and feel life again. Once that is achieved(withdrawls), PAWS is next and that can last up to 2 years considering how heavy of a user and for how long. All i know is it IS POSSIBLE to recover from opiates and enjoy every breathe of air and know i never have to be tied to the biggest baddest ball and chain. Thays how i feel about it...but today i am free!!! Goodluck to you and hopefully he can find some inner peace before this drug lands him six feet under...",2

&gt;heroin isnt much more dangerous then most opiods however when you take it, it might have fentanyl it might not, it might have research chemicals it might not. When its legal it can be regulated so you know what you are getting every time.

Especially in my arm case it was late at night and basically Christmas Eve, so you had the pissed off working nurses doing pre-op. I cannot remember much at all - the mind has a brilliant defence mechanism.  
We also have the NHS systemic problem that bupe is for smackheads. Addiction specialist GPs - two of mine are highly regarded in the UK - still prefer methadone for smackheads, or bupe on daily blue scripts.  


For all my major surgeries (4) now I've been on oral morphine, fentayl patches or pain relief doses of bupe in the ug range. I am lucky in that all the epidurals have never taken I've always had an assigned pain nurse, fully briefed who makes sure I get triple IV morphine carts in the pumps for the first 48 hours to swamp and displace the bupe from my mu opiate receptors.  


I've learnt to demand and hard. I was on a ward for 10 tens in February 2018 - anyone on the UK or with VPN iPlayer access the documentary Surgeons at the Edge was filled at the QEH when I was in for my second bowel resection and one of the team was on my team - the pretty brown haired surgical resident - she actually hugged my wife after the surgery. In the next episode they show a shattered humerus being fixed. It's not me, but it's almost identical, even down to 13 screws!

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho back to my point controlled drugs/CDs are dispensed every four hours orally if not on an IV pump. We hit four hours and ask. The record between myself and a very young Seikh teen with a septic internal stoma bag was five and half hours late. Wouldn't double dose, so we missed one and they fucked up the dosing pattern before bed time. 

At least back then if you go the right nurse on side (muchos love to Jules on QEHB Ward 728) she made sure my zolpiclone, oramorph, codeine, paracetamol and TPN were all ready before she went off shift. I also snuck some cyclizine in so those nights were fcking awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

You have to demand care. In the NHS you are British. You don't want to bother the nurses and the doctors. Fuck that. You've had a huge hole calved into you. It hurts, they have a duty of care and that  Hippocratic oath thing to ease suffering.

Meu problema com o partido tem muito mais a ver com a proximidade com o PMDB em dado momento, com o DEM etc. Fico sim com uma impressao de que o MBL surfou a onda dos protestos, mais ou menos na mesma medida que o Vem pra Rua, e dali se lancou pra jogar o jogo.

Os cortes sao um problema diferente. Um que surgiu e ganhou proporcao (parte do sub tenta passar pano, mas a real eh que tinha gente pra caramba nessa manifestacao) por conta da inepcia do governo na comunicacao. Pq o sr. Weintraub, seguidor de Olavo, calado, eh um poeta. A tarefa era relativamente simples... o corte na educacao tem motivo, nome e sobrenome: nao tem dinheiro. O poco secou. Eh isso. O decreto foi assinado um mes antes. Era explicar pra populacao da forma mais didatica possivel que o pais ta quebrado, que as reformas precisam passar e que por ora a unica solucao viavel eh apertar o cinto.

O que faz nosso heroi? Vem a publico dizer que o corte eh punicao por balburdia. Dias depois tem de voltar atras na bravata, mas ai o caldeirao ja ferveu. o Ricardo Rangel foi cirurgico num post de ontem:

&gt; O governo precisa de 308 votos para aprovar a reforma da Previdência na Câmara.  
&gt;  
&gt;Conseguiu 307 votos para aprovar a convocação de Weintraub para explicar o que está fazendo na Educação.

E hoje o Antagonista matou a pau:

&gt; A esta altura, dada a magnitude das manifestações de hoje, está claro que os protestos não são apenas contra os cortes — ou bloqueios — na educação.  
&gt;  
&gt;São — ainda de maneira difusa — contra um governo que, em quatro meses e meio, vem se mostrando inepto para enfrentar os enormes desafios que o país impõe. Um governo que conspira contra os seus melhores integrantes, desnorteia o seu próprio partido no Congresso, confunde realidade com redes sociais e tem um desequilibrado como guru. Um governo no qual reina a cacofonia mais absoluta.

They seek to flood America with third world retards, often claiming they are refugees from wars- wars that Israel started. They have dual citizens in our govt that support Israel instead of America. They seek to censor free speech. They accelerate and encourage degeneracy. They control all the media that produces exclusively pro Israel propaganda.

There's this concept, pharmaceutical determinism, where individual cultures have ideas on how drugs are used and their effects, which differ from the literal medical effects of the drug. For example, heroin in the states is considered something that only no-lifes do, ruins your life, makes you Rob your family, etc. Whereas another, extremely similar in effect, opioid such as oxycotin is seen as something mainly used medically, and even the recreational perception is that of a party drug, and something that kids fuck around with for a bit and kick. The truth is that both of these drugs to essentially the same thing on a medical level, but the combination of placebo effects from one's perception of a drug and the simple idea that, for example, only someone who doesn't care about their life or is too deep to care would start doing heroin given the stigma and association of it. In some eastern cultures, I believe the Philippines is an example but don't quote me on it, heroin is perceived as a workers/laborers drug, and that's how it's used the vast majority of the time.

I'm not saying that heroin is something people should see lightly or do recreationally. But the fact of the matter is that pretty much every drug has benefits and downsides, which aren't necessarily reflected in our perception of then or our legal definitions of them.",1

Meaning your ability to pair bond simply decreases as you have more and more sex. So it doesn't bode well for long term monogomous relationships either where you repeatedly have sex with the same person, over time you have less and less oxycotin being produced as a result. 

High N count is not a sign of lack of self control or self respect. I guess it depends on how high we are talking. I'd say it's a sign of open mindedness and maybe even empathy / compassion for the male need to have sex. Depends on the woman and the situation around her N. If she doesn't mind having sex, doesn't see the downside to having sex with unique partners (perhaps she is not aware of all these studies we are all aware of), she doesn't feel the need to withhold sex from men and gives it freely to them so they get to feel good too.",2

Nadie en su sano juicio va a ir a pagar una entrada a una obra de teatro si en su casa no hay comida. La vida se reduce a existir, a sobrevivir. Sin distracciones, sin gustos, sin nada más que lo estrictamente necesario.

Mid game = heavy meds in secure can; IFAK, iBuprofin/Vaseline/GoldStar, ALU Splint, etc with basic meds in pocket; AI-2, army bandage, basic splint, Painkillers. Sometimes car med kits in rig if you’ve a lot (I usually do...I have a whole case of just salewa and cars)

Late Game: IFAKs and morphene and ALU all in pockets/rig

I spend my time actually reading the facts instead of listening to talking heads give their uninformed opinions on matters. That apparently makes me sound uninformed to people who clearly know more like yourself.

I do not really watch CNN, but I am aware of its existance. My primary sources are all print, and data. What I have learned though is that data is intrinsically liberally biased according to people who label the media as being intrinaically liberally biased.

Climate change is a scientiffic fact. God does not give people measles. God does not force women to be pregnant. The death penalty does not reduce crime. Marajuana is not as dangerous as Haroin and Meth. Guns DO kill people.

Those are what we call facts. There is data to support them ovjectively and overwhelmingly. Then there are people to argue policy and what to do about it, but when you want to talk abojt arguing over what is and what isnt, that is a bunch of bullshit. Maybe americans dont mind 11,000 gun related deaths because they like guns, and that is a policy choice, but saying that those policy choices have no impact on gun related deaths is pure fiction.

The real question isnt how informed am I, the real question is are you informed enough to be the judge of if other people onow what they are talking about or not, or are you the embodyment of Dunning Kruger, and if you arent questioning your own reasoning regularly about that, then its pretty obvious that your beliefs and world view are compromised.

I am active duty military, and I have not just been to other countries, I have lived in them. I have seen poverty that would blow your mind, then come back to america and learned that we have the same problems but call ourselves the richest most powerful country in the world, but cannot afford universal healthcare, and quality education.

I have been to israel and jeruselem, and done jobs for the embassy, and people died over saying the embassy was moving to jeruselem when that is a bad idea (objectively), and also a total lie, as the embassy is still in Tel Aviv, and only a consulate was moved into jeruselem, because there is no space in that city to even make a proper embassy.

I have been to Africa, the mediteranian, all over europe, the phillippines, Japan, and the middle east.

239,2019-05-12 14:36:16+00:00,"Decided to be completely honest about my (few and isolated) cases of self-harm during admissions for the army.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have not suffered from self harm but have explored it in a very un-machocistic way, as well as a half handfull of other times where i felt like i needed the pain or deserved it. I scored well on all tests, both physical and mental. I always thought openness and transparency was important, so i was open about the insidents. However the doctor who asked me about this apparently had no experience or good knowledge about mental health and so he said i was getting a rejection right then and there, but he encouraged me to complain and send a document from a psychologist i had been talking to previously about a very rough time for me. He assured me that it would be quick and simple and that i was very welcome because of all my good grades.   


I do as we agreed and get a rejection. Try again and this time their reasoning is basically ""The decision was made by an experienced doctor"" so i didn't get into the army, which was the ONE THING i knew i wanted career/education-wise. I honestly don't understand their reasoning at all, and from what i could tell it was pretty much a ""because we said so"" at the end.  


So since the army was out of question for at least another year, i had to go study and wanted to have a part-time job at the same time. Studies are nice and things look like they'll be alright. ""I'll just apply for the army again after this year of studying"" was my thinking.   


Then at work my boss decides my working stance is off and so i get punishment pushups. I know this is not common practice, but it's litterally my first real, stable job so i don't back down. Environment is hot and has a high humidity all day, I'm somewhat dehydrated, and the boss has particulaar requirements i'm not used to for completing the pushups properly. I do my best and push myself untill my muscles are no longer capable of holding me up and then push myself further. Still end up failing the required punishment so he tells me to go home and try again tomorrow.   


When i get home i'm so sore i need help to get off my clothes and backpack. At work the next day i tell my boss i pushed myself too far yesterday and by the same requirements as the day before i can do 7 pushups at the most. It was a guess of a number to make clear what my state was. He says fine and gets me to do 7 static pushups (30 seconds on the way down, and 30 seconds on the way up for each pushup) I'm thinking ""fine"" and go for it. Go straight to the ER at 02:00 the following night with the most intense pain i've felt in my life. Morphene doesn't work  even after they double the dosage, sleep maybe 6 hours in total over the next 4 days (depending on how you count my feverdreams/hallucinations)  


Diagnosis was training-induced Rhabdomyolysis. that was a bit over 1 year and 8 months ago now and i've litterally lived in constant pain since then. Unable to work, cook my own food (or even put the food in my mouth on bad days), can't exercise properly, failed allmost all my exams the first year because i was not able to attend fieldtrips and lost my ability to write after listening to bad advice. Last fall i started a new study which i am barely able to tag along with. (I passed my last exam with 0.6% to spare)  


I live in a country with supposedly good healthcare, but the unusual circumstances around my injury and young age (fresh out of High School when injured) makes the healthcare services refuse to give me any financial support. Mom has to take care of me every day and make sure i get something to eat. 

Sorry for the long one. Needed a short vent.

243,2019-05-12 06:04:38+00:00,"Eh it was rough, but isn't life in general sometimes.

They have treatment( and i mean treatment of all mental health issues) type retreats for kids i know of that essentially consist of ; like 10 adults and a bunch of kids out in the desert for a month,  not the best idea honestly, heard alot of bad things about em.  Apparently some kids get mistreated under the guise of help. (think of the camp from Holes, with some kind of therapy. Im sure they have them for adults, though

Both inpatient and out patient Treatment centers  have wayyy less oversight than they really should. Especially with how both mental health and addiction are still fucking stigmatized,  and they always have a few bad apples employed for these companies that exploit the shit out of people, then they get promoted type things. Especially because addicts already bullshit and manipulate,  so some people that work for these places think every patient the facility has at the time are lying about everything, combined with admins taking employees words without any questions or doubts, when multiple people complain about the same assholes.

Also treatment is very helpful for alot of people, but most inpatient treatment is only 30 days long,  while also costing sometimes over 30 grand a month depending on your level of care, unfortunately 90% of these places exist only to separate you from your money, and try to convince you that 30 days is enough time to break habits of bad behavior that you developed over years.

 Amd these places know that 30 days aren't enough, so they basically imply to you over and over where if you go home and relapse,  its because your a bad person, when in reality its because treatment is only 30 days long, on top of some people needing to detox for 2 weeks, where the person is basically useless for 2 weeks in bed, because its hard on your body. And everyone is required detox for atleast 3 days just for observation.  So you don't even do anything psychologically helpful for almost a week after you get to treatment.  Very few people are going to be able to break a habit that they've been using intrinsically for years to cope with an emotional disregulation. Its not going to happen with most people realistically.

Because any addiction is not the actual problem, because any addict uses, binges(eating, watching), etc to cope with unbalanced or too intense of emotions, because they never learned any other way, or had been using so long they forget the right way. And fixing a bad habit or behavior that took years to develop to the extent it has, takes constant constant consideration and awareness. Ill have to fight my addiction the rest of my life, even if though ive been sober 3 years and that's ok. But if i ever forget where i came from or stop fighting, i could easily pick right back up where i left off, which is how most addicts od.

Usually goes like this. But does a gram of herion a day, hes been doing it so long, and because of his tolerance for the effects of the drug, he has to take more and more to have the same effects ( basically he's grown more opiate receptors because the old ones desensitize.  So your brain grows more to get the same amount of feel good. Well when you stop  they resensitize but now you're brain has more receptors that are more sensitive that they were a month ago, which means the less does more to your brain. The problem starts when addicts leave rehab after a month, go buy the same amount of herion theyve been doimg for years, so they've inadvertently doubled the strength of thier drugs, because not only are there more  receptors , they're now more sensitive. So now the amount of herion that was just enough to keep them high for not even 24 hours, now makes them sieze, stop breathing, and die.  

And then the most fucked up thing now is fentantyl. Is like 10x stronger than herion, and the dosages are a 10 times smaller, but dealers dont give a shit about their customers, because people get addicted to shit all the time. 
And addicts have fucked up thinking. I know when i was used using, if i heard someone had od'd i would probably think they were stupid, but that id want some of those killer drugs, because in my mind, the guy that selling strong stuff, i didnt care about the dangers, i just wanted to get as fucked up as possible as possible 24/7 for almost a decade. Luckily im still a young 27, and didn't do any lasting physical harm to myself (that i know of).  Im glad i still have my life.

Hope this helps someone get some kind of insight be they addicted person, a normal person, mentally ill person or someone who knows someone struggling with these any of these things

247,2019-05-12 01:11:38+00:00,"Ohhhh!! I can answer this! I’m 24hrs post op! 

Let me tell you that this surgery is so easy!

I went to pre-op 1:15pm. They did the IV asked some medical questions then I waited. Surgery 3:40pm. Everyone was cool and nice to me. Asking exactly what I was having done. I woke up alert. I was cramping from my period all day right before my surgery so when the nurse asked if I was feeling any pain I said I’m cramping from my period and she gave me something that helped. I Asked to pee because I had to and knew that’s what they want before you leave. 

I asked for jello and a coke because I hadn’t ate or drank anything since midnight the night before so my throat was super dry to where my mouth was pasty. I would have choked on crackers for sure. I wasn’t nauseous or anything at all. I was in post op around 30-45 minutes. 

Came home. Immediately chewed a GASX tablet. Because from past posts they mention the gas. When I take deep breaths like they want you to post op I can feel small gas bubbles but it’s not painful just kind of weird. I don’t know if you have ever taken a deep breath and maybe felt gas before? But if you have that’s what it feels like just maybe a little more than normal. 

I actually ate a couple slices of pizza but mostly I was drinking water and Gatorade because I was so thirsty. My doctor prescribed me nausea medicine and some oxycodine but I haven’t used any type of medicine what so ever. No Advil. No Tylenol. No nausea medicine no oxycodine.  Just the GASX tablets. 1 every 6-7 hours. 

Sleeping wasn’t bad either. I slept on my side the whole night and didn’t wake up from pain. I could feel the gas some but it almost settles in place hahah when you stay in a position for some time. 

I’m only sore at my incisions. There are 3. One in my belly button. One right above my pubic bone and one on my left side about 3 inches towards my stomach. I don’t have any trouble sitting up or moving. I actually just finished painting my new computer desk lol. My abs are sore like a workout. Not an intense workout like a moderate one. I’m not really bloated either other than I just started my period for the first time in years since I’ve been off birth control since February lol. My doctor said I might bleed some but I can’t say how much because I’m on my period. 

I haven’t had any cramping either from surgery. I just got over the stomach flu this Tuesday and I can 100% honestly say that was worse than this surgery. I was super scared of this surgery but the stomach flu was worse lol. 

I only took 1 nap today. Im not loopy or anything. So don’t be worried or freaked out it’s so much easier than I even imagined! I wish I could have done this years ago!",5

Jeg mener blot at det er fint at der stilles spørgsmålstegn ved hvorfor der benyttes relativt meget oxycodon når der findes et bedre førstevalg. Når behandlingsalgoritmerne baseres på videnskab bør der netop ikke være forskel mellem specialer og regioner. En afdeling bør med andre ord have et godt argument for at foretrække oxycodon fremfor morfin til behandling af stærke smerter, snarere end den gode gamle: Det plejer vi.",2

First let me say that methadone is not a bad thing. There are people who need to stay on for a long time or forever. The problem is how the clinic is run. It's a money maker and they Don't want you to leave . I had decided to switch to Suboxone and the Dr at the clinic refused to wean me off. I was taking 290mg of methadone. There is no reason anyone should have that high a dose. So to get on subs I had to cold turkey the methadone for three days. Easily the most painful moments of my life 
   Fast forward to the present and I've been maintaining myself on 10 mg methadone. Everytime I try to go any lower and go into full withdrawals. I went and bought some kratom. My last methadone tab was yesterday at 11 am. So far no withdrawals. I think this is going to wrok",1
274,2019-05-10 23:09:02+00:00,"Youre missing the point. The reason so many former wrestlers became drug addicts was because they were self medicating for pain alleviation.  Pat is an easy and safe way to do so. Instead, pot was banned and they would get legal prescription drugs like percoset or oxycotin, which are much more addictive and dangerous. They took them and drank because it was the only way to relieve the pain that comes with wrestling night after night.

Of course they became addicted and got worse by finding unscrupulous doctors who would keep prescribing it for them. The ones that fell out of wrestling and ran out of money had to turn to cheaper alternatives like heroin for the same high, like many pill addicts in this country now do. And plenty of them died young from years of painkiller addiction.

This couldve been avoided if Vince just adopted a safer, albeit illegal alternative of letting them smoke pot. Would it have been different for all of them? No. Theres still plenty that wouldve stuck with pills or abused alcohol. But for many of them, their lives wouldve been different because they never wouldve had to step down that fucked up road of prescription painkillers to begin with.",3

Thier jobs are to get you as close to death as possible and with the least amount of pain as possible without having side effects. 

As for the sub, I'd definitely either ask the doctor for some pain meds to take 5 days before surgery so the bupe gets outta your system OR I'd cut down to 1-2mg's a day before surgery. I know that sounds hard to do if you're taking 16 mgs a day but that's alot better than being in pain (that meds won't take care of) after surgery. 

My wife gave birth after getting down to 1-2mg's of bupe per day and they ended up giving her a buncha 50-100mcg fent shots during labor and then gave her a 50mcg/hr fent patch for post-labor pain. They tried to give her 2 percocets but she was like FUCK NO, I'm on subutex and 2 perks ain't gonna cover any of my pain. I didn't think it'd work but the nurse eventually went and asked the doctor and he approved the fent patch. She didn't think it was working at all since 50mcg's an hour really doesn't give you any kind of buzz but after taking it off after 3 days, she realized how much it was helping her pain and she just didn't notice it until it was no longer working. 

I've also had a friend (at the time, hate his guts now) that broke his neck in a car accident and only took their IV morphine and percocet pills for about a day or two. They weren't really working very well 'cause he's one of those idiots that thinks he needs to take 16-24mg's of bupe for a little 20 lortab a day habit. Anyway, his hospital doctor and sub doctor talked to each other and suggested that he just start taking his sub again. They weren't making him but he agreed with them and just took sub while dealing with a broken neck for like 2-3 months. 

Fuck that! If I break my neck, I want some 4 or 8mg dilaudid OR some 15 or 30mg roxies AND some ER oxy 60 or 80s OR some MScontin 60s or 100s OR some 75 or 100 mcg fent patches or some 40mg opana's.",2

291,2019-05-09 15:02:09+00:00," Em derrota do governo e do ministro Sergio Moro, a comissão do Congresso que analisa a [medida provisória da reforma administrativa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/governo-bolsonaro-cede-e-agora-admite-recriar-dois-ministerios.shtml) decidiu nesta quinta-feira (9) tirar o Coaf (Conselho de Controle de Atividades Financeiras) da pasta da Justiça, transferindo-a para o Ministério da Economia.

 Apesar do [discurso do governo de que a permanência do órgão na Justiça](https://painel.blogfolha.uol.com.br/?p=31068) era fundamental para o combate à corrupção, venceu a pressão de integrantes do centrão e da oposição, em uma nova derrota que expõe a fragilidade da base aliada do governo federal no Congresso.

 Depois de três dias de sessão, a votação foi nominal: foram 14 votos a favor da mudança e 11 contra. O [governo esperava manter o conselho com Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/moro-diz-que-coaf-e-estrategico-e-que-guedes-nao-se-interessou-pelo-orgao.shtml) com ao menos 15 votos na comissão.

  Criado em 1998, o Coaf é um órgão de inteligência financeira que investiga operações suspeitas. 

  O Coaf recebe informações de setores que são obrigados por lei a informar transações suspeitas de lavagem de dinheiro, como bancos e corretoras. O conselho analisa amostras desses informes e, se detectar suspeita de crime, encaminha o caso para o Ministério Público.

 Durante a crise do Mensalão, ofícios do Coaf entregues à CPI dos Correios indicaram, por exemplo, grande volume de saques em espécie por parte da SMPB, empresa de Marcos Valério, o operador que abasteceu o esquema de pagamentos a políticos da base do governo petista. 

 Mais recentemente, o Coaf identificou movimentações atípicas de Fabrício Queiroz, ex-assessor do senador Flávio Bolsonaro (PSL-RJ). De acordo com o órgão, Queiroz movimentou R$ 1,2 milhão de janeiro de 2016 ao mesmo mês de 2017 —entraram em sua conta R$ 605 mil e saíram cerca de R$ 600 mil. A quantia foi considerada incompatível com o patrimônio do ex-assessor de Flávio Bolsonaro. 

  

 ### Prazo da MP

 Nessa comissão mista do Congresso, na qual participam deputados e senadores, o governo sofreu uma outra derrota nesta quinta-feira, além do caso do Coaf. O processo de [demarcação de terras indígenas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/maia-fala-em-retirar-demarcacao-de-terras-indigenas-da-agricultura.shtml), que havia sido transferido para o Incra, no Ministério da Agricultura, voltará agora para a Funai, no Ministério da Justiça. A mudança foi aprovada pro 15 votos a 9.

 Ainda é preciso votar [outros pontos da reforma administrativa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/funai-tem-de-ficar-com-mamae-damares-nao-com-papai-moro-diz-ministra.shtml). Foram apresentadas[ 31 propostas de alterações no relatório](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/relatorio-propoe-devolucao-da-funai-a-justica-e-mais-17-mudancas-em-ministerios.shtml) do líder do governo no Senado, Fernando Bezerra Coelho (MDB-PE).

 O texto de Bezerra Coelho[ já estabelecia a devolução da Funai (Fundação Nacional do Índio) para o Ministério da Justiça](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/funai-tem-de-ficar-com-mamae-damares-nao-com-papai-moro-diz-ministra.shtml). Pela reforma promovida por Bolsonaro no início da gestão, a fundação estava no Ministério da Mulher, da Família e dos Direitos Humanos.

 Para que essa medida provisória não perca a validade e a reestruturação da Esplanada dos Ministérios promovida pelo presidente Bolsonaro no primeiro dia do ano seja desfeita, a MP precisa ser votada também nos plenários da Câmara e do Senado até 3 de junho —ou seja, [a mudança do Coaf para a pasta da Economia, por exemplo, ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/moro-usa-rede-social-para-defender-que-coaf-permaneca-na-justica.shtml)ainda precisa ser ratificada pelos plenários das Casas.

 ""Somos favoráveis que o Coaf permaneça no Ministério da Justiça porque faz controle das atividades financeiras e é instrumento importantíssimo no combate à corrupção"", disse o líder do Novo na Câmara, Marcel Van Hattem (RS).

 Parlamentares contrários à permanência do órgão na Justiça argumentaram que manter o Coaf nas mãos de Moro poderia provocar uma superconcentração de poderes com o ex-juiz.

 ""Ele [Moro] conseguiu esta semana mudar uns dez votos. A mim ele não convenceu. Ele não me convenceu, como política de Estado, o que justificaria o Coaf ficar no Ministério da Justiça. Ele [o Coaf] funcionou muito bem até dezembro. De janeiro para cá, ele não funciona"", disse o líder do DEM na Câmara, Elmar Nascimento (DEM-BA).

 Parte do chamado centrão não quis atender ao pleito de Moro para a manutenção do Coaf no Ministério da Justiça. Líderes de partidos desse bloco chegaram a trocar integrantes que eram contra a mudança.

 O centrão é formado por partidos que, apesar do discurso geral de apoio ao governo Bolsonaro, não têm se alinhado automaticamente ao presidente. São associados por bolsonaristas como a ""velha política"".

 Inclui parlamentares de DEM, PP, PR, PTB, PRB, Pros, Podemos, Solidariedade, entre outras siglas menores —na Câmara, somam cerca de 200 dos 513 deputados federais.

  

 ​​Moro topou largar a carreira de juiz federal, que lhe deu [fama de herói pela condução da Lava Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/moro-se-inspirou-em-operacao-da-italia-prendeu-lula-e-ganhou-status-de-heroi-veja-trajetoria.shtml), para virar ministro da Justiça. Disse ter aceitado [o convite de Jair Bolsonaro (PSL)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/sergio-moro-aceita-convite-para-ministerio-da-justica-do-governo-bolsonaro.shtml), entre outras coisas, por estar [""cansado de tomar bola nas costas""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/12/cansei-de-levar-bola-nas-costas-diz-moro-sobre-troca-de-judiciario-por-executivo.shtml). Tomou posse com o discurso de que teria total autonomia e com [status de superministro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/bolsonaro-anuncia-moro-no-superministerio-da-justica-e-promete-nao-interferir-no-combate-a-corrupcao.shtml). Desde que assumiu, porém, acumula recuos e derrotas.

 No mês passado, em entrevista a um jornal português, [Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/se-der-errado-a-culpa-e-de-bolsonaro-brinca-moro-sobre-perfil-no-twitter.shtml) comparou uma [indicação ao STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) a ganhar na loteria](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/moro-diz-que-virar-ministro-do-stf-seria-como-ganhar-na-loteria.shtml). “Seria [ir para o STF] como ganhar na loteria. Não é simples. O meu objetivo é apenas fazer o meu trabalho”, disse, ao ser questionado sobre essa possibilidade.

 Questionado se o STF seria uma opção segura caso sua vida política acabe mal, Moro afirmou que atualmente “nem existem vagas” na corte. 

 Pelo critério de aposentadoria compulsória aos 75 anos dos ministros do Supremo, as próximas vagas serão as de Celso de Mello, em novembro de 2020, e Marco Aurélio Mello, em julho de 2021. 

 ### 

  **RECUOS E DERROTAS DO SUPERMINISTRO MORO**

 **Decreto das armas**  
 Seu primeiro revés foi ainda em janeiro. O ministro tentou se desvincular da autoria da ideia de flexibilizar a posse de armas, dizendo nos bastidores estar apenas cumprindo ordens do presidente. Teve sua sugestão ignorada de limitar o registro por pessoa a duas armas —o decreto fixou o número em quatro

 **Laranjas**  
 No caso do escândalo de candidaturas de laranjas, enquanto Moro deu declarações evasivas, dizendo que a PF iria investigar se “houvesse necessidade” e que não sabia se havia consistência nas denúncias, Bolsonaro determinou dias depois, de forma enfática, a abertura de investigações para apurar o esquema

 **Caixa dois**  
 Por ordem do Palácio do Planalto, a proposta de criminalização do caixa dois, elaborada pelo ministro da Justiça, vai tramitar separadamente do restante do projeto anticrime

 **Ilona Szabó**  
 Moro teve de demitir a especialista em segurança pública por determinação do presidente, após repercussão negativa da nomeação. Ilona Szabó já se disse contrária ao afrouxamento das regras de acesso a armas e criticou a ideia de ampliação do direito à legítima defesa que está no projeto do ministro

Não havia na carreira europeia do meia-atacante Lucas, 26, uma atuação tão grandiosa como a desta quarta-feira (8), em Amsterdã.

 Pelo clube do Morumbi, foi decisivo no [título da Copa Sul-Americana de 2012](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2012/12/1200547-com-desistencia-de-rival-argentino-sao-paulo-conquista-a-copa-sul-americana.shtml) antes de se despedir do Brasil e [partir rumo ao Paris Saint-Germain (FRA)](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/vencer/ult10110u1134325.shtml), onde o futuro também sinalizava com uma evolução constante na elite europeia. Não foi o que aconteceu.

 Depois de chegar com moral à França, foi perdendo espaço para as cada vez mais caras e midiáticas contratações dos parisienses, [reforçados com a ajuda dos petrodólares](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/02/paris-saint-germain-tem-teste-de-protagonismo-na-europa.shtml) da família real do Qatar, e acabou relegado à condição de mero coadjuvante.

 A falta de afirmação no cenário europeu custou ao meia-atacante [continuidade na seleção brasileira](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2014/11/1545812-lucas-sofre-lesao-e-e-cortado-de-amistosos-da-selecao-brasileira.shtml). Em 2014 e 2018, assistiu às duas Copas do Mundo de casa. Ele que, quando saiu do país, parecia figura certa na renovação da equipe nacional ao lado de Neymar.

 O chamado ""hat-trick"", quando um atleta marca três vezes em um mesmo jogo, foi algo que o jogador nunca havia conseguido em seis anos de Europa. Foi registrar o primeiro justamente pelo Tottenham, clube que defende [desde o início do ano passado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/01/1954751-tottenham-anuncia-a-contratacao-do-brasileiro-lucas-moura-ex-psg.shtml), em vitória sobre o rebaixado Huddersfield (ING) no último mês de abril.

 A chegada à [Premier League](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/03/livro-sobre-premier-league-relata-revolucao-nos-direitos-de-tv-no-futebol.shtml) na janela de inverno europeia de 2018 foi difícil e custou ao brasileiro, que entrou na equipe londrina com a temporada já em andamento.

 Foram apenas 2 gols e 5 assistências em 17 partidas, quase sempre como reserva.

 Na atual temporada, porém, Lucas tem se mostrado peça relevante no projeto do técnico argentino Mauricio Pochettino, atuando como titular na maioria das partidas.

 Já são 15 gols, 10 deles no Inglês e 5 na [Champions](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/liga-dos-campeoes/), com os três mais importantes de sua carreira marcados nesta quarta, em Amsterdã.

 De Ligt e Ziyech abriram 2 a 0 no placar para o Ajax, gols que mantiveram os holandeses classificados durante 95 minutos. Na etapa final, Lucas marcou os gols da virada por 3 a 2, o último aos 51 min, para levar o clube inglês a Madri.

 Estreante em finais de Champions, o Tottenham irá encarar um adversário especialista em decisões do torneio. O [Liverpool](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/liverpool-obtem-virada-historica-contra-o-barcelona-e-vai-a-final-da-champions.shtml) venceu cinco (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 e 2005) das oito finais que disputou.

 Será a primeira vez que a competição terá um campeão inglês desde 2012, quando o Chelsea (ING) conquistou o título sobre o Bayern de Munique (ALE). Além disso, os dois farão a primeira final inglesa desde 2008. Na ocasião, o Manchester United bateu o Chelsea e levantou a taça.",1

You may think drug laws are unjust, but I don't. My ex was a Haroin addict. She didn't just hurt herself, she destroyed our family and our kids lives. She also got one of my cousins hooked on the drug. He died of an overdose a few years ago.

305,2019-05-08 19:24:56+00:00,"As for whether it would pass congress (esp. with this POTUS) I would doubt it. 

The opioid crises can be mitigated for less. Albeit the ""treatment"" isn't Opioid Antagonists like Suboxone/Naloxone or Methadone.

No, the way you stop the opioid crises is with Heroin. 

Yep, you heard me: Heroin Maintenance Programs would save the taxpayers the ballooning cost (no pun) of $45 billion we spend every year for the following reasons:

1. Heroin is cheap: The average cost for a bag of smack is $4-$6 per 1/10^th gr. If the government became the *de facto* authority on HMP, the cost would go down significantly.

2. Antagonists like Suboxone and Methadone are 300X stronger than heroin. It basically makes a junkie dope sick to dope, which only makes them crave dope more. The analogy, ""you don't fight a fire with fire, you put it out with water"" is apt here (plus insurance companies make them incredibly expensive to buy/purchase since addiction isn't fully covered as part of 'pre-existing conditions.')  

3. With the government in control of HMP, the gak's RP (relative purity) would be purely heroin (and not 'scramble', which is heroin admixed with fetanyl.) 

4. You use a method of titration with benzodiazipines (like valium) to ween the addict slowly from off heroin and onto the benzo. Once the patient is completely withdrawn safely, you begin tappering. After that, use amphetamines as an antidepressant (or ketamine, your choice) to curve compulsion to use again (or cannabis with kratom, since both can curve compulsion to use opioids.)

5. Finally, C/DBT in both individual and group settings with rapid rehousing to help reintegrate the addict back into society without the expensive cost of jail and court. 

Problem solved.",0

&amp;nbsp;  





&gt;“GOD THE WARRIOR TAKES SIDES (9:1-8).  In this section Judah is set on one side, Judah’s neighbors on the other.  God, whose power extends to all nations, takes Judah’s side, and as a ruler who goes to war for his people he vanquishes Judah’s neighbors.” (Cody, 1990, p. 357)  
&amp;nbsp;  




“1. **Burden [of a] word [of] YHVH*** in [the] land [of] **HaDRaKh** and Damascus, its resting,

for to YHVH, eye of man [*’ahDahM*], and all tribes [of] YiSRah-’ayL [""Strove God"", Israel].”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“The first words, **The burden of the word of the LORD**, are the superscription for the whole collection of prophecies in chs. [chapters] 9-11.  Original in this place, the same words were later copied in 12:1 and Mal. [Malachi] 1:1 to distinguish these as separate collections.  The expression is found nowhere else in the Bible … **Hadrach** is mentioned in Assyrian documents as a city of Syria, north of Damascus and Hamath.” (Dentan, 1956, pp. VI 1,093)  
&amp;nbsp;  





“2.  And also HaMaTh bordered in her, TsoR [Tyre] and TsiYDON [Sidon], for she was wise very.”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“The siege of Tyre, Alexander’s most brilliant military exploit, lasted seven months, ending successfully in July, 332 B.C.  Ezek. [Ezekiel] 28:1-34 (which some believe to be another prophecy inspired by Alexander’s siege) also makes a great point of the alleged ‘wisdom’ of Tyre.” (Dentan, 1956, pp. VI 1,093)  
&amp;nbsp;   




“3. ‘And built, TsoR, a MaTsOR [fortress] to herself  
 

and TseBaR [heaped] silver like it was dust    


and fine gold like it was mud [of] courtyards.  
&amp;nbsp;  
 



-4. And behold, my Lords dispossessed her,   


and smote in[to the] sea her rampart,  


and she in fire was consumed.  
&amp;nbsp;  




-5. “See, Ashkelon, and see, and Gaza, and writhe much,  


and Ekron, for embarrassed is her expectation,  


and is perished [the] king  from Gaza,  


and [in] Ashkelon do not settle.  


-6. And *will settle, a bastard, in Ashdod*,  


and I will cut off [the] pride [of] Philistines.”’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“*A bastard shall dwell in Ashdod*] This character would suit Alexander very well, who most certainly was a bastard; for his mother, Olympia, said that Jupiter Ammon entered her apartment in the shape of a dragon and begat Alexander!  Could her husband Phillip believe this?” (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. IV 510)  
&amp;nbsp;

“7. ‘‘And I will remove their bloods from their mouths,

and their abominations from between their teeth.”



And will remain also he to our Gods,

and he will be as a chief in YeHOo-DaH [""YHVH Knew"", Judah], and Ekron like a Jebusite”’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“The prophet does not look forward to the extermination of the Philistines, but to their conversion.  The result of God’s victory, achieved by the hand of Alexander, will be that the Philistines will henceforth observe the dietary laws, which forbade the eating of blood (Gen. 9:4) and of certain kinds of animals (Deut. [Deuteronomy] 14:3-20; Lev. 11:2-23), and will become a remnant for God like the faithful remnant of Israel of which the book of Isaiah speaks (10:20-22).  Just as the Jebusites, the original Canaanite inhabitants of Jerusalem (II Sam. 5:6), were assimilated into the Hebrew population (II Sam. 24:18), so the Philistines will become a part of the people of God under conditions of full equality.” (Dentan, 1956, pp. VI 1,094-1,095)    
&amp;nbsp;  

  




&gt;“Many of the Philistines became proselytes to Judaism; and particularly the cities of Gaza and Ashdod.  See *Joseph*. [Josephus] Antiq. [*Antiquities*] lib. xiii, c. 15, s. 4.” (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. IV 510)  
&amp;nbsp;  




“8. ‘“And *I will encamp to my house* from army, from trespasser [מעבר, *May`oBayR*], and from settler,  


and will not pass upon them anymore a tormenter,  


for now I will see with my own eyes.”’”   
&amp;nbsp;  
 




&gt;“*I will encamp about mine house*] This may apply to the conquests in Palestine by Alexander, who, coming with great wrath against Jerusalem, was met by Jaddua the high priest and his fellows in their sacred robes, who made intercession for the city and the temple; and, in consequence, Alexander spared both, which he had previously purposed to destroy.  He shewed the Jews also much favour; and remitted the tax every seventh year, because the Law on that year forbad them to cultivate their ground.  See this extraordinary account in *Joseph*. [Josephus] Antiq. [*Antiquities*] lib. xi, c 8, s. 5.” (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. IV 510)  
&amp;nbsp;  

  




“9. ‘“Rejoice much, daughter [of] TsiY-ON,  


Cheer, daughter [of] Jerusalem,  


behold, your king comes to you,  


just and **saved**.  


He is humble and rides upon a donkey,  


and upon an ass, son [of] she-asses.”’”  
&amp;nbsp;  
  




&gt;“The participle **nôšā`** is passive: the future king is not one who saves (although the LXX^1, VL^2 , and Vg^3  make him that) but one who has been saved, delivered, by God (cf. Ps 33[32]).” (Cody, 1990, p. 357)  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“The climax of the oracle pictures the coming of the messianic king.  The prophet sees the army of Alexander as only a tool in the hand of God.  Riding invisibly with it is the God of Israel and the long-expected Prince of Peace, who is about to enter Jerusalem and re-establish both the geographical borders and the spiritual glories of the ancient kingdom of David.  The victory is his even though he is no warrior and comes riding not on a war horse, but upon a beast which symbolizes a nation at peace.  The portrait of the messianic ruler is no doubt modeled in part on the mysterious figure pictured in Gen. 49:10-11.” (Dentan, 1956, pp. VI 1,096)  
&amp;nbsp;  










&gt;“See this prophecy explained on Matt. xxi, 5.” (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. IV 510)  
&amp;nbsp;  




“10. ‘“And I will cut off chariot from Ephraim and horse from Jerusalem,  


and will be cut off bow [of] war;  


and [he will] word ‘peace’ to nations.  


And his rule [will be] from sea to sea and from river until ends of [the] land.’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“… in v [verse] 10 God, speaking in the first person, says that he himself, the divine warrior, will vanquish the chariot and war horse, but that peace to the nations will be spoken by the earthly king.” (Cody, 1990, p. 357)  
&amp;nbsp;  





“11.  ‘“Also you, in [the] blood of your covenant,  


I sent forth your prisoners from a hole; [there was] no water in it.  


-12. Return to a stronghold, prisoners of the hope;  


also today declare [מגיד, *MahGeeYD*] a second [time], [that] I will return to you.  
&amp;nbsp;  




-13. For I have drawn you to me, YeHOo-DaH,  


a *bow* I filled, Ephraim,  


and roused your sons TsiYON,  


*upon your sons*, ***YaVaN***,  


and set you as a sword [of] a brave.”’”  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;The object pronouns are feminine.  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“*against your sons, O Javan*: *Yāwān*, originally **Ionia**, stands for Gk [Greek] lands generally.” (Cody, 1990, p. 357)  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“Judah is the *bow*, and Ephraim is the *arrows*: and these are to be shot against the Greeks.  I am inclined, with Bishop *Newcome*, to consider that the language of this prophecy is too strong to point out only the trifling advantage which the *Maccabees* gained over *Antiochus*, who was of *Macedonian descent*…” (Adam Clarke, 1831, p. IV 511)  
&amp;nbsp;  




&gt;“The rest of the chapter seems to be an appendix added to the preceding oracle when its prophecies were not fulfilled and the Greeks had become the world power from whom deliverance was to be expected.  Its warlike spirit contrast sharply with the peaceful temper of the preceding section, and suggests at least the possibility that it may stem from a different hand.” (Dentan, 1956, pp. VI 1,097)  
&amp;nbsp;  




“14. ‘And YHVH upon them saw,  


and went forth like lightening his spear,  


and my Lords YHVH in[to] a horn blew,  


and went in storms southern.  
&amp;nbsp;  




-15. YHVH Armies defended upon them,  


and consumed them,  


and defeated sling-stones,  


and drank them like wine,  


and filled them as a basin, as corners [of an] altar.’”  
&amp;nbsp;  





&gt;“This verse and the two following are very corrupt… The ferocity of vs. [verse] 15*b* is almost unparalleled and is perhaps due to a corruption of sense which is even deeper than the versions would indicate.” (Dentan, 1956, pp. VI 1,097-1,098)    
&amp;nbsp;  





“16. ‘And will save them, YHVH their Gods, in that day, like a flock, his people,  



like stones of a crown lifted upon his ground.  


-17. For what is His goodness, and what is His beauty?  


Grain, sons and new wine, budding virgins.’”

I wish they had told me that, because I didn't like how I felt kinda loopy. Is that what happened to you too? Or did they give you fetanyl separately?

Doctor told me to take one every 6 - 8 hours did so for a week and 2 bottles went by. I don't remember much. All I remember that there was a lot of blood on the bed and 5 tubs of ice cream with blood in them. The my friends on Xbox were saying that I was screaming at the top of my lungs. One of them said I was taking too many pills and they were trying to convince me to stick with the scheduled. I lost 20 pounds that week. I don't remember how I went to use the restroom if I went. 

I remember bits of how it felt. I felt no pain, I feel that feeling of cuddling with my wife, (oxycotin is the cuddle hormone). I felt light and thought I could do anything. Did some driving and bought a lot of computer parts at full price at best buy and built me a crappy computer with 20tb of storage for some reason with 4gb of ram for like 5 grand, sobered up and returned EVERYTHING.

We have universal healthcare here, so yo get a bill from your insurance company telling you
a) Collect your receipts from the pharmacy for the year and then send the collection to them. Based on your income , your sickness( chronic or not) and some other minor things, the I.C calculate a yearly upper limit. 

If you paid more than that limit ( and believe me it never went over 50 euros for me in the past decade)  you get everything above the cut, back. 

b) You know, that you have a disease which requires constant medication. So you ask at the I.C and they tell you the yearly cost . Then you pay this sum and get a ""Free""-Card. That means the "" mind. 5 euro and nothing more than 10% "" -rule for medication will not affect you.

But you must consider we have not one opioid OTC, every painkiller like Ibuprofen is only sold in packages with no more than 20 not 2000 like the american version. You will either play a really good show or live with the pain because the docs here are really really careful NOT to prescribe anything stronger than metamizol ( the last strong painkiller before they start with tramadol or codein).

I got my oxys to the point, where the doc said to me "" sorry, you are too young and I can't treat you anymore. You could smell the fear but I understood him, even when I was in pain, again. So the way leading  to the "" real"" H from prescribed opioids is the same. With the small difference that I can take my ""Free ""-Card ( which costed me 48.49 € this year )and get my daily Morphin from another Doc, with a better rotation plan. He is an expert on this field because he is an anesthesiologist and pain-coach.

All in all. It's kind of bittersweet,  but H is the only drug which I really paid for. 

And that's it folks, when you need a hip replacement, minimalivasive operations with multi-million dollor/euro equipment, you will get it. If you have diabetes you get your insulin.

each kanji, as characters, is a morphene with their own meaning, but not all of them can be used alone by itself. (like ok for 海、山 etc, but not for 立、見 etc.)

While words, combined by mutiple kanji characters (morphemes), constitute as the smallest element to be uttered with practical meaning. 

楽 has several meanings, one of them is music (more like playing an instrument to produce music to be exact). You can see this kanji come with many words such as 洋楽、楽団、楽譜 etc., all relating to music.
Another meaning of 楽 is like happy and relaxed. e.g. 快楽、安楽、極楽 etc.

as a word with practical meaning (linguistics-wise), 音楽 is the common Japanese word for music. In general if you want to present the concept of music as in English you use 音楽。

Yes they are confusing for each kanji has a meaning, I believe remembering the kanji 
is essential, but focusing more on learning how they are combined as words might be more ""practical"".",1

Imperialism isnt just something that was done 100 years ago by Europeans in tri-cornered hats. It's absolutely still happening today. 
When the World Bank uses predatory lending to force a country to lower its labor and environmental standards and allow its natural resources to be privatized and purchased by multinational corporations, thats imperialism. WHen Hilary Clinton green lights a fascist military coup against the democratically elected government of Honduras because the fascists are more friendly to the US, thats imperialism. When Nike employs private contractors that enslave people, thats imperialism. When the Coca Cola company gobbles up water supplies farmers need to grow their crops, leading to famine... that's imperiasm. When Lays sues poor Indian farmers for 150 million for growing the same kind of potatos they use for their potato chips... that's imperialism. It is still happening today. THe only way to ""get over it"" is to stop it. 

Imperialism is also not something that just white people do. The people of TIbet and Xinjiang probably have a few things to say about their Chinese occupiers.
No one ever said it wasn't okay to be white. You appear to view the world in a racialized manner and are projecting that onto others. White people absolutely suffer under this global neoliberal capitalist regime as well. How many white people have had their lives destroyed by Purdue Pharmaceuticals flagrantly lying to doctors and pushing addictive oxyconton on patients in order to maximize their corporate profits? Tens of thousands, easily, in just the past few years. Far more than have been killed by Terrorism. We care about those white lives as much as any other, and you should too. We should all care about each other and strive to work against the systems that oppress all people for the benefit of a small few. 

Youve been fooled by all this ""anti SJW"" bullshit.  Its nothing but straw man fallacies and distrotion, my friend.  You don't need to feel judged for being white. THe only thing you're being judged for is failing to recognize the deep structural violence in the system which both benefits and oppresses you.",11

I don't cop off a corner unless it's a rare circumstance. I have 4 or 5 phone numbers I can call and they will meet me in South Philly or West Philly usually. I started seeing the fentanyl showing up whenever I had to cop off a corner in Kensington. When I first saw it I thought I got ripped off because I was used to seeing grey or tan powder dope but the fentenyl is pure white and mixes up clear unlike regular heroin that mixes up brown.

Most of my regular guys still sell the regular heroin and I usually pay about $6 a bag. The extra $1 is like a delivery fee but it's worth it because I know I'm not getting ripped off or busted. Recently one of my backup guys started selling the pure white fentanyl and I actually prefer that. My normal dose of the tan heroin is 2-3 bags but the fentanyl is much stronger and I can do 1 bag. When I first started doing it I would fall out after doing 2 bags. I was lucky never to od. 

It's just crazy how much heroin there is in this city. It is literally flooded with dope. I remember back in the 90s coke was everywhere and you could only get heroin in certain areas and it wasn't as widespread as this.

One thing that really bothers me about this area is the open air pill market in Kensington. I used to be able to go to the corner of K&amp;A and get Xanax cheap and easy. Now I go there and 80% of the Xanax is fake stuff with no active drug in it. Before this I knew the bars were pressed but they always had some benzos in them. Now they are mostly fake pills with no drug in them. This just started happening over the last 8 months. It's so bad I don't even go there and I'm sure a lot of people don't either.

350,2019-05-04 17:58:37+00:00,"Ive been wanting to open a dialogue on this subject. I live in Philadelphia which unlike most east coast cities still has a large open air drug market. Probably like most of you i've been on and off dope for many years. The change ive seen on those streets over the last few years is astonishing and terrifying. People are dying at ridiculous rates. The entire drug market has changed. It's always been powder form dope sold in stamp bags with dozens or hundreds of different stamps being sold by different groups on different corners at any given time. Dealers stand on their corners and call out the name of their stamp. When a new batch comes out they give out samples in the mornings. The samples would of course be the best and the quality would fall off over time untill they'd put a new stamp out. Dealers began cutting in fetanyl years ago often time for the purpose of causing a lot of people to overdose as a sick form of advertising their product. When i started using over a decade ago the dope was actually herion and was ordered by the bag, $10 each.  I remember i used to buy 4-7 bags to get well. Thats $40-$70 unless I could afford a bundle (14 bags) for between $80-$120.  At a point some corners started selling $5 bags which were usually low quality. I think this is where the fetananyl started coming in. I got clean for a couple years and stayed off the streets. Things changed drastically. Now a bag is $5. Its only fetenyl now. I litterally do not know where to actually buy heroin now. 
At this point I try not to use as it has completely devastated my life many times over. I try not to ever develop a habit, but through and through im a fucking junkie and i slip up. This is very dangerous. Nearly everytime I slip up and use I overdose no matter how much I try to judge the potency, doing MINUSCULE amounts of one $5 bag. I've actually began planning for this, making sure I use in a public place where I will be found and revived with narcain if I accidentally use too much. The last time I used I tested a small amount, felt little to nothing so thought I would be ok and still get a little rush if I used less than half the bag. Since there are no safe injection sites and ive been robbed everytime ive fell out on the street, i went to a gym where I am a member, hid all my drugs except one bag and a needle so the paramedics would know to give me narcain but not confiscate my whole stash. I used less than half a bag and of course ODed. I know this is pathetic but this is what is happening everywhere. Starbucks and McDonalds bathrooms are the closest thing we have to a safe injection sites. Ive noticed alot of encampments popping up on main streets where people will go to use because its just too risky to use in the many shooting galleries tucked away in abandoned buildings. I remember years ago when a state of emergency was declared when the homicide rate rose above 300 in the year. I dont even want to look to see what the number of overdose deaths is so far this year, but i know its way over 300. Something needs to be done. We need monitored and legal safe injection sites now.",8

384,2019-05-02 18:54:59+00:00,"Eu concordo com tudo que você falou, exceto a parte de viagem no tempo. 

Como dividimos o tempo? Segundo é a unidade de medida mais simples? Obviamente não. Você pode dividir 1 segundo em infinitas partes, como por exemplo, 1\*10\^-15 (0,000000000000001 segundos). 

Como o viajante do tempo consegue acertar a exata linha do tempo em que tudo aconteceu exatamente igual à linha do tempo dele, e depois retornar à própria linha do tempo? (Não estou dizendo que foi o caso desse filme em específico, que eu não vi e nem pretendo ver, por motivos de não gosto de filme de super heroi.. exceto Logan)

Torna-se inverossímil. Se viagem no tempo existisse, a mente humana não consegue conceber tal coisa. Mesmo com a joia em mãos, se alguma criatura conseguir calcular o momento exato de sua viagem, ela precisa ter um tipo de mente superior, capaz de encarar grandezas que a mente humana NÃO SABE LIDAR, pois não foi feita pra isso.

Ricky and Morty lida com viagem no tempo da melhor forma possível, e é quanticamente plausível que seja daquele jeito (aleatório, tentativa e erro e com um número infinito de consequências)

390,2019-05-02 03:58:10+00:00,"Her mother created her and made her what she is. If Dee Dee didn't die Gypsy would have. Dee Dee would've killed her when she felt the ruse was up and Gypsy was no longer a sympathy/financial magnet.

Let's remember that Dee Dee tried to murder her stepmother and most evidence posts to her killing her mother AND building up her tolerance of morphene so it was as painful as possible.

Gypsy was horribly abused. Phsyically and mentally. Since before she was old enough to understand what was happening or why.

I think Nick is as culpable as Gypsy is as far as manipulation goes. Let's not forget that Nick introduced her to BDSM, was super controlling, and kind of took advantage of the fact that Gypsy was used to being controlled by her mother and used that sexually to get Gypsy to he submissive to him. Gypsy saw it as romance until reality hit her in the face AFTER her mother was killed.

I think Nick got screwed because he was on the spectrum and obviously slow and Missouri gave zero fucks about that. I do not think Gypsy was some puppeteer though - I think they were both immature and socially stunted and weren't thinking realistically.

So while I do agree that Gypsy is manipulative in a childlike way I think it's because she didn't know any other way to be. She was a kid trying to get what she wanted the only way she knew how. Remember that she was highly isolated and wasn't really even allowed to talk in public. Dee Dee always held her hand - go watch the interviews. You can legit see her squeeze it when Gypsy is saying the wrong shit.

I think the case is sad all the way around. For Nick and for Gypsy. I think Gypsy needs massive counseling. I'm glad her dad and Stepmom are in the picture.

I 100% believe had this not happened Gypsy would be dead instead and that crime would've bothered me way way more than this one.",1

The guy I bought them from didn't know what he had and his mom just died from cancer so I got 60 of the 200mg green MScontins for $5 each, $300 total and those green monsters lasted me for at least 15-20 days because most days I'd just take 3-4 in an entire 24 hr day. 

They were hard as a fucking rock and I could barely even cut them in half so there's no way I could've gotten them into a powder without a lot of work. I also sold some for $25 each but when I ran out of them, I regretted selling them for so cheap but nobody in my area likes morphine and it was nice profiting $20 off every pill I sold. 

I personally never liked morphine myself either until I ran across the 200s and took 300-400mg's at a time. I used to run across 30s and 60s for $5-10 each but was always disappointed that I didn't feel shit off of them whether I took them orally or snorted them. But the 200s will give you a newfound respect for morphine. I've been looking for 100s and 200s ever since then because I liked them so much but haven't had any luck. 

TBH, I'd WAY rather have a 200mg MScontin than 2 80mg oxycontins......if I couldn't sell them and money wasn't an issue. TBH, those 200mg MScontins were probably the strongest pills I've ever had before if I don't count patches or fentora or actiqs or anything besides pharma grade (not pressed fent) pills.",1

402,2019-05-01 00:03:31+00:00," Passou um quarto de século, mas [Ayrton Senna](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2014/05/1447793-confira-uma-selecao-de-frases-de-ayrton-senna.shtml) continua sempre presente quando se fala de F-1 no Brasil. E isso é facilmente explicável, embora, em minha opinião, advenha de uma abordagem errada do esporte em si.

 A Globo, [identificando Ayrton no “herói brasileiro”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/10/ha-30-anos-senna-conquistava-1o-titulo-e-status-de-heroi-com-vitoria-epica.shtml), com direto a musiquinha e elogios de todos seus narradores e comentaristas, tornou o excelente piloto um verdadeiro ídolo popular. A ponto de, [com seu prematuro desaparecimento](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2014/ayrtonsenna/), a atenção para a F-1 ter assinalado uma brutal queda de audiência.

 Uma queda, diga-se, que não se verificou em outros países, onde a atenção para o esporte a motor independe da presença ou não de um piloto local que possa ser campeão.

 Para um exemplo claro, basta lembrar a Itália, onde os GPs têm boa audiência (uns mais, outros menos, dependendo das mais diversas circunstâncias) embora seu último campeão mundial da categoria tenha sido o falecido Alberto Ascari e sua Ferrari, nos anos 1952 e 1953. Há 66 anos!

 Ou então a Alemanha, onde a F-1 sempre teve boa audiência, embora seu primeiro campeão mundial, Michael Schumacher, tenha aparecido apenas em 1994, com a equipe Benetton.

 Em minha opinião (e debati este ponto de vista muitas vezes com meus bons colegas do SporTV, quando lá trabalhei) o erro da direção da Globo foi acreditar que o Brasil sempre teria um campeão mundial.

 Com efeito, a saga de ótimos pilotos, iniciada lá atrás com Chico Landi, teve Emerson Fittipaldi, Carlos Pace, Nelson Piquet (para lembrar apenas os mais famosos) e chegou a seu ápice com Ayrton Senna. 

 Quando ele desapareceu tragicamente em Ímola, a Globo apostou todas suas fichas em Rubens Barrichello, um ótimo piloto, mas não à altura de Senna. E isso, por sinal, prejudicou a história de Barrichello aqui no Brasil. Embora, lá fora, não lhe tenha trazido problema algum, pois tanto críticos como o grande público europeu não embarcaram nesse julgamento.

 Para mim, colocar Ayrton Senna num hipotético pódio de todos os tempos é bastante fácil. Com a premissa que esse julgamento começa com o início do Campeonato Mundial, em 1950, quando já tinha condições de analisar as corridas de uma forma profissional, sem o entusiasmo do menino que, levado pelas mão do pai, ia a Monza ver Nuvolari e os outros grandes pilotos de antes da 2ª Guerra Mundial.

 Aí o julgamento seria influenciado pela paixão e —provavelmente— não teria o equilíbrio que julgo ter alcançado.

 Feita essa premissa, de que me limito a levar em consideração apenas os GPs dos últimos 70 anos, o melhor piloto que vi foi, sem dúvida, o argentino [Juan Manuel Fangio.](https://acervofolha.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/02/23/ha-60-anos-fangio-foi-sequestrado-por-guerrilheiros-cubanos/)

 [Ele ganhou cinco títulos mundiais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1995/7/18/esporte/16.html) com as mais diversas marcas, desde Alfa Romeo em 1951, passando por Mercedes em 1954 e 1955, continuando com Ferrari em 1966 e encerrando com Maserati em 1957.

 É nesse último campeonato que eu encontro o grande diferencial de Fangio, pois ele levantou a taça com um carro que era inferior à Ferrari. E teve, no GP da Alemanha, a 4 de agosto de 1957 no tradicional circuito de Nurburgring, aquele que ele mesmo reconheceu, falando comigo anos depois, como a maior atuação de sua carreira.

 Recorde-se que ele tinha pela frente o esquadrão da Ferrari, que contava com pilotos de alto nível como Mike Hawthorn, Peter Collins, Luigi Musso (que se classificaram em 2º, 3º e 4º lugares, ratificando a excelência do carro).

 Logo após Fangio, porém, eu coloco —empatados— Ayrton Senna e Jim Clark.

 Ayrton venceu em todas as condições, seco ou molhado, e correndo por várias equipes, desde a modesta Toleman Hart, passando depois para a Lotus até chegar ao ápice com a Mclaren Honda, onde formou excepcional dupla com Alain Prost e ganhou três títulos mundiais. Mas sempre, é bom lembrar para estabelecer a diferença com Fangio, tendo o melhor carro.

 Para o britânico Jim Clark, que em toda sua carreira só dirigiu Lotus, ficam 2 títulos mundiais e um triunfo nas 500 Milhas de Indianápolis. Mas, acima disso, a constatação de que, mesmo quando pilotava um carro inferior ao dos adversários, conseguia mostrar toda sua classe.
