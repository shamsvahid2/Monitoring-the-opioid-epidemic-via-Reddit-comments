There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Thing with reposte is that is very turn efficient since you are attacking while it is not your turn and this speeds up your tempo which is optimal vs low tempo comps like stress ones. Reposte comps fall under the damage/control group and the reposter to be set up needs only one trinket slot. The most solid reposter in my opinion is MAA. 
When building your reposte comp you should favor damage/utility heroes and you should have one hero dedicated to finish enemies. Be wary that the term ‘reposte comps’ doesn’t imply that you have to take with you multiple reposter, but instead it is meant for comps that facilitate your reposter’s job, filling what he sacrifices for reposte and synergizing around his strengths!",1

This is probably during the interim where the doctors are conferring with his fmily about how to proceed. Their options are severely limited but plastic facial reconstruction is their best bet here. The guy is going to be completely blind and have to be fed through an IV for a while until the get around to reconstructing his jaw so he can eat, but you're looking at thiusands of dollars of reconstructive surgery and physical therapy as well as traumatic injury therapy.

His arms and chest are strapped to the table. He's moving around like that because the drugs are starting to wear off. He has no idea where he is, but he recognizes he is in a hospital because he hears hospital noises. He tried to sit up, but gave up, and stopped moving which makes me think he realized that  he was in intensive care and settled down.

Not really.  It was seen as an extended release version of oxycodone (which it is).  Oxycodone had been available since the 1960s in combination with ASA and APAP as percodan and percocet.  Abuse issues were well known.  Nobody thought ""they took the tylenol out so it's not addictive anymore.""  What pharma probably did, imo, was infiltrate the schools that educate MDs and PharmDs.  ""Pain is the 5th vital sign"" and ""Untreated pain is the number 1 patient dissatisfier"" were mantras I was trained in.  If you were being stingy with pain meds you weren't looking out for your patient's best interest; you were being a paternalistic asshole.  A ""human being"" is suffering!!

The ""Untreated pain is the number 1 patient dissatisfier."" quote hits on the other problem.  The government gave patients satisfaction surveys and tied hospital compensation to those scores.  A physician's career depended on getting good scores.  If a patient wants opioids/benzos and you won't give them to him then he is going to give you terrible scores.

If we made this stuff legal and regulated, you wouldn't see this because no one actually wants to be this fucked up. People could actually take a reasonable dose and have a positive, safe experience.

Especially with the RAVE act in place, which prevents shows from having testing stations, and the STRONG push of fetanyl from China, we are seeing even more people accidentally take fetanyl or otherwise laced drugs and nearly dying because they can't test their stuff or seek help.

22,2020-07-30 11:36:43+00:00,"Heroin is part of a class of drugs known as *opioids*. Opioids contain chemicals that bind to an opioid receptor in the brain and result in effects such as sedation, euphoria, itchiness, constipation, etc. 

Opiods may be synthetically created in a lab or harvested from plants. When sourced naturally instead of synthetically, they're referred to as *opiates*. All opiates are opioids, but not all opioids are opiates. The most common natural source is *opium*, the dried gum of the seed pods of poppy plants. 

Opioids cover a wide variety of legal and illegal drugs from opium, laudanum, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, oxycodone (brand name OxyCotin), hyrdrocodon (brand name Vicodin), hydromorphone (brand name Dilaudid), and, yes, heroin. 

Morphine is a naturally occuring substance found in plants and animals (including us -- some human cells can biosynthesize morphine in small amounts). Medical morphine is harvested from the opium of poppy plants. Heroin is basically refined morphine. 

Here's the imporant part though: **just because opioids can be safely prescribed under a doctor's supervision does not mean heroin ""isn't dangerous.""** 

This: 

&gt; The only dangerous thing is how the injections are dealt, usually poor hygiene, dirty syringes..

is *absolutely false*. 

**All opioids are dangerous.** Overuse of any opioid can be physically addictive. Overingestion of any opioid can be fatal. Even if you're taking opioids in a hygenic pill form, they can quickly and easily kill you if taken improperly. 

The dangers of unsafe usage (poor hygiene, dirty needles/syringes) are additional dangers of unregulated use of illegal drugs. Taking those things away doesn't make a drug harmless. 

Could heroin be prescribed and used responsibly under a doctor's supervision? Sure. And in some countries that is legal. 

But because something *can* be used in a safe manner doesn't mean it's ""not dangerous."" Fire is used safely every day in millions of way around the world, including your kitchen. Used inappropriately -- even by accident -- fire will *fucking destroy you*. Same with *all* opioids.",1

The worst pain felt like I had a cracked rib (sharp stabbing pain when moving even a little bit) and felt like air was trying to squeeze through my ribs but luckily I don't think that lasted for too long. For most of the recovery I think it was just a dull ache and the incision sites were very sore, even once they healed over properly they continued being sore (probably because of the metal brackets sticking out and I kept pressing them a lot due to thinking they were the bar sticking out at the time lol). You may also experience some pain in your back if I remember correctly.
Most surgeons have never experienced the nuss procedure so will never know the extent of the pain, I found my pain was at it's worst a few months in but if you do find your pain unmanageable let them know as soon as possible and they can increase your pain meds to compensate.
I think my pain was more than usual because my surgeon was fairly inexperienced (he mentioned the last patient came in 4 years prior, apparently it was another doctor that did their operation and I had bruising on my back which was weird). I also started to wane myself off the pain meds early as I didn't want to become overly reliant on them and I have high pain tolerance.

I remember the pain trying to make me have doubts if it was all worth it and ""what have i done to myself"" but let me tell you it was definitely worth it.

I think they only gave me co-codamol because when I was in hospital following the procedure they kept giving me morphene via drip and tablets but it made me nauseous and throw up as we later learned my body rejects it (took them 7 days of me throwing up daily to reach that conclusion). No physiotherapist came to see me after the operation either but I read up on it so much prior to the operation that I knew how not to bend etc so I managed. Feel like the first few weeks was the most stressful as you feel overly worried and have to be very careful. The worst part was a couple of months in in my opinion but eventually you'll get to a point where you don't feel any pain aside from the discomfort of the metal brackets sticking out. The best day will be when the bar is removed, went home the next morning without any issues.
It's a long journey but try to not worry yourself too much, take each day as it comes and it will be over before you know it.
I think they only recommend walking to get the blood pumping and to help your lungs expand a bit do don't feel like you have to walk so much everyday, especially if the pain gets worse. It's alright to have an easy day resting. I don't think I did a lot of walking in the beginning.
Another thing is, don't start reading up about people's stories on their bars flipping, I remember going down that rabbit hole and it made me paranoid for sooooo long.
Anyway just try to take care and not worry too much, you'll be alright.",1

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

#Fentany Reagent Testing

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.

An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

The most notable change is the Intel system, which is a resource you gain from killing thralls (that now spawn in every mission on an occupied node, not just special lich ones) instead of murmurs. You then use Intel as a currency of sorts to interact with your lich in many ways, including forcing a confrontation or stealing its weapon.

You also have the Assets, which is stuff that the Lich finds and acquires, like subordinates, lieutenants, weapons, etc. It results in mission modifiers (most of them are not functional in the web game because they're outside of what I can reasonably code, but some of them actually work). You can then seek and destroy those assets for loot.

And then the lich ranks, requiems, and territory systems have been changed a fair bit too.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

Paracetamol is something you should stay on top of. Keep it in your system. It's not a miracle painkiller but it keeps the pain down quite a bit. After 4 days I stopped taking all pain meds except paracetamol and ibuprofen (depends on your pain tolerance), I stopped taking any tramadol, codine, oromorph as I was sick of being constipated.

No one is sure If I flipped over the top landing railing and onto the bottom landing or if I fell down the stairs fully but either way I “woke up” on the floor in my kitchen to my dogs licking my face. I couldn’t see anything besides colors and kept passing back out. Eventually crawling to my sleeping BF (he fell asleep on the couch) I told him I had fallen down the stairs and couldn’t see very well (tho by this time I could make out shapes and objects). He called an ambulance but they thought perhaps 2-3 hours had gone by from when I fell to when I made it to BF as the bleeding in my stomach had fully distended my stomach. I looked like I was 9 months pregnant. By the time I was in the ambulance I had my normal eyesight back. 

On the ride to the hospital, from all the jarring around?I died a few times. The longest tho I think was for a minute or so. I just wanted to sleep and the pain was unbearable even tho I had been given a lot of phentanol which I fought them on, I thought for some reason that was how Michael Jackson died. A few times when I came back it was “okay we got her back”. Although I was in a lot of pain (turned out to be a ruptured spleen) I still remember trying to think what it felt like when I died. But it was nothing, like a blink. I’m not sure if I had died for longer if I would have a better story. 

It’s since made me scared to die. Because now I feel like I know there is no light or anything, it’s just nothing. No life flashing before my eyes, no tunnel no nothing.

Then I had to sit there for like an hour puking and in pain, and then they gurneyed me and then I had the weakest painkillers in history.

Mokichi keeping up with (and still not managing to hurt) a non-removed raian who wasn’t using any techniques whatsoever is not much of a feat. 

It’s already been stated that Rihito took Mokichi by surprise with his growth, and the fight was only settled so soon because the latter wasnt in his groove at all.

Top A tiers are waka, gaoalng, raian, julius, Setsuna etc. Rihito can’t hold a candle to any one of those, no matter which you pick.

Mid-low A ones would be Okubo, Rei, Muteba, hell even Omega Akoya. Rihito also can’t realistically beat any of these.

Many B classes likely also whoop Rihito’s ass. Saw Paing can only be taken down with Razors edge, but he’d annihilate Rihito in an in-fight. Someone like Seki or Kiozan would overwhelm him with the size and skill difference. Even Adam just straight up knocks my guy out, Rihito has shown little dodging ability, he relies on his heavier frame to tank. 

All of these guys can be put down instantly with Razor’s edge, but Rihito simply hasn’t shown tje fight skills (and doesnt have the experience) to realistically roflstomp (or even win, really) any of these matchups reliably. He still loses to very many fighters, despite his growth so far.

Lastly, nowhere is it stated that Jose is weaker than falcon. They are radically different fighters, and I would be giving the W to José if I had to pick one. Hell, falcon is a striker on the lighter end of the weight spectrum, if his misdirection gets figured out or neutralized, he has nothing other than some morphined nails to work with. 

He has all of these gimmicks because he, inherently, has very little going for himself in a setting that doesn’t have weight classes. At the end of the day, the only real threat that Falcon poses to higher tiers is his poison. Nothing else about him stands out.

You jump to a lot of conclusions, and I cannot agree with anything you’re saying about Rihito lol.",2

72,2020-07-27 22:55:55+00:00,"This all stems from a breakdown in trust for institutions, including large media outlets like the CBC.

Here's a nice illustration as to why:

&gt;""It disturbs me when I see people acting on information that I'm quite sure is not only incorrect, but potentially misleading and potentially leading to harmful outcomes,"" said Dr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious disease specialist at McGill University. 

&gt;As a practising physician at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital, Oughton has seen first-hand the toll COVID-19 takes. Close to 9,000 people — largely seniors and people with underlying medical conditions — have died in Canada from the virus. 

While a close reading shows that the 9000 number is for all of Canada, the way the paragraph is worded is misleading.  First they imply that Oughton has seen the toll ""first hand"" then they immediately insert the Canada-wide number with no segue; they're clearly trying to get readers to hastily infer that the 9000 deaths are from one hospital, but they still have plausible deniability because it's technically correct.  It's dishonest and people, on realizing that they've been tricked, will start to do the opposite of what they're told, just in case.

Case in point, Teresa Tam (and Anthony Faucci).  She told everyone, early in the pandemic that masks actually made things worse because people would touch their face and thus infect themselves.  We now know that this is incorrect and that she knew, at the time, that she was spreading misinformation in order to safeguard supplies for frontline staff (Faucci said the same thing when he testified before congress).

I have no problem prioritizing frontline workers but I think that her lying, while being lauded as an ""expert"" who we should trust implicitely be media such as the CBC, instead of simply laying out the situation and asking people to make sacrifices has contributed to this movement.  People feel like they've been tricked but they aren't able to acertain the truth themselves so they react in one of two ways:

1) They act like the updated information was the information given all along, this way they were never tricked.

2) They assume Tam, and then all other ""experts"", are acting maliciously and do the opposite of whatever they're being told.

For the record, I don't agree with the anti-mask ideology; I and my kids have been wearing masks (and washing hands) when going to businesses since April.  But I get the feeling.  And I absolutely question the effectivness of mandating masks, rather than simply recommending and providing them.  

I have yet to see either the government or any major media outlet, who're constantly pushing masks and attacking critics, put out any hard research showing the effect of masks, or pushing PSA style adds that actually inform rather than coerce.  I don't believe that masks are any more important than hand washing and I think ""social distancing"" 2 meters away from people was a joke from the beginning.  

This corona virus has been hyped up to be this game-changing existential threat that we're never seen before, but it simply isn't.  It spreads along common vectors, in basically the same way as the flu (which goes to show how poorly long term care homes have been managing other viruses).  We know what to do with the flu: cover your mouth, wash your hands and stay home if you're sick.  We could have done this from the beginning, but the ""experts"" vacillated instead, creating doubt and mistrust and, yes, blowing things out of proportion.

We act like this pandemic is the end of the world.  Why?  A super high death toll?  We have more fentanol overdoses every year in my city that we're had coronavirus deaths; we don't shut down schools and businesses (not even pharmaceutical businesses).  Because anyone is vulnerable?  Also not the case: 90% of deaths in Ontario were over the age of 60, most of those were over the age of 80.  And, while this wave has had a higher death toll than the seasonal flu, we've also had an incredible mild flu season, probably because people who would have died from the flu died from covid instead. 

We need to stop panicking.  We need to have rational discussions around what measures are appropriate and what powers the government should have in the name of ""protecting"" us.  We need to see the raw data, not ""expert"" interpretations.  We need to stop demonizing the other side because we're just so much smarter than them...

We need to start asking how this happened.  How did it get out of control in China?  Why were we so slow to put border measures in place and issue sane health guidelines?  Why was information so confused initially and where were our emergency pandemic stockpiles?  Why are we still relying on an organization like the WHO when they couldn't prevent a world wide pandemic, even with all the information they had?

We can't have these discussions while everyone is hysterically blaming everyone else, and maybe the CBC and their bosses like that just fine.",1

My first was in the service when a piece of reinforced glass opened my left forearm and resulted in severe nerve pain.  The second was when a dentist left live nerves in a root canal. While the pain only lasted seconds each time it was enough to drop me to the floor each time. Next was a kidney stone. The pain is hard to explain but at the time the only solution was to wait it out. Similar in duration was food poisoning from oysters. A totally different kind of pain and probably can be listed as extreme discomfort even though the stomach pain was around an 8.  Now, all of the above incidences of pain were level 10.  The nerve pain even though short was intense, the stone was not only bad it was hours and hours.  However, they all pale in comparison to the pain I received as a result of cancer.  The cancer pain itself never rose above 7 at its worst but the treatment to remove my jaw and then have a reconstruction during a 16-hour surgery was by far the most pain I have ever encountered.  I would not endure it again to save my life.  I can honestly say that I would not conceive that a human would first, be able to live through that kind of pain or second doing so without losing their mind. The only thing that remotely reduced the pain besides being unconscious was intravenous  Dilaudid. No other painkillers touched it and frankly, only 4-hour doses of Dilaudid combined with alternating Oxycotin doses allowed me to get through a 10-day hospital stay.  After the hospital, the pain level seldom reached a 10 for more than a couple of hours a day and even today, 13 months after the operation there is pain. I am thankful for fantastic doctors that had the ability and knowledge to replace a cancerous jaw, not that many around. Even though they were not able to remove my cancer and 7 weeks of radiation and chemo made and continues to make life hell. I am alive and 10 months after radiation, my pain rarely gets above a 3.

98,2020-07-26 21:27:30+00:00,"Hi I went thru bmt back in 2015. For context, I’m a introvert and have social anxiety. I went into bmt after poly and went to Tekong (jc 200+ poly 50ish pax company). Although I could feel the difference in mindset between the jc kids and me (your typical zai nan behaviour - never exercise/did sports, Low eq high iq), I could still bond with majority of my bunk mates less for one/two douches. 

I wouldn’t say I experienced the same feelings as you felt, but I felt more of a sian feeling. Like I super dreaded the days before I entered bmt. One thing my friends and I did was going to jb to go to a spa to calm ourselves and just chill to take our minds off our enlistment date (abit hard to go jb now but you can check out natureland or yunomori spa). Good alternative is Sentosa too, now free entry for cars till september 30th I think. 

I’m pretty sure it’s normal to feel uncertain or anxious about conscription and fitting in. But I guess the good/bad part is that you’re going thru this period with a bunch of guys with the same background. I don’t necessarily mean your education or family status, but you guys are around the same age and have about the same life experience. So it’s not very hard to bond/click with anyone. In fact I think you had to actively be an asshole or just be super blur to get anyone to hate you. Some of the friends I made throughout my years in navy was the best friends I could’ve ever had. I guess going thru hardships together just bonds us differently. 

The grass is always greener on the other side. People always like to compare their unit or experience is the toughest etc. Asides from elite units (NDU/Guards/Commandos), I’m sure that there are some aspects of mono intake which are tougher than Tekong boys vice versa. I remembered during my pop parade rehearsals, 1sir mono intake joined us for the trainings in Tekong. I remembered they were pretty fit but their marching was pretty horrible (not saying all mono intakes or 1sir are like this, I just happened to see that particular batch which rehearsed with us). 

Oh yea a tip, I know everyone dreads bmt/ns, but don’t be a downer all the time. No one likes a guy who just half-fucks everything and just kengs and complains whenever possible. Help your section/platoon/coy mates whenever possible! It’ll help with your mood and who knows, maybe one of them would return the favour when you need it (of cos don’t help them expecting an IOU, it’s army after all, they’re bound to be some idiots/assholes). Army also taught me how to deal with people when I was working and studying. Some of my friends became pretty organised and minimalistic after living an army life. Of cos there are others who just didn’t learn or picked up anything during this period. Usually people from this group always complain that the two years was a waste of time blah blah...

Unfortunately over the next few months my back pain got so much worse and I kept complaining. Thinking there was actually a slipped disk or something more serious so I began pushing for a better scan. My insurance company kept rejecting the more expensive scan (PET) and I had to go to an orthopedic surgeon who would also not push for a scan. I was told I needed to do a few weeks of PT first. All this time the pain was getting so bad I worked up to Oxycotin to try to dull it. In fact at its worst I was at a high dosage along with the maximum ibuprofen and Tylenol etc every day. 

Finally when I lost all feeling in my legs one night the insurance company finally approved a scan. I got in late on a Friday night due to a cancellation. It was a weird scan because they kept claiming that something went wrong and had to rescan. I figured they were new or not very good, not that something was wrong.

The next morning (a Saturday) my doctor called me and said to see an oncologist ASAP. I literally started treatment that Monday due to a tumor the size of a newborn baby pressing against my spine. Stage 4 lymphoma which had also spread and was super aggressive.

Spent 6 months in the cancer ward getting 8 rounds of my chemo regimen, 5 bone marrow biopsies, 8 spinal injections, a stem cell transplant, 8 weeks of radiation and probably 20+ PET,CT and X-rays. 

4 years later I am in maintenance but “no change”. Waiting to hit 5 years to get an all clear but I’m not the same. I have holes in my bones and my spine is. It right but I’m alive.

&gt;What do you mean ""accidentally""? Is it an accident to kneel on someone's neck which has been recorded clear as day?! Even if the person committed crime, what right does the police have to use disproportionate force to mistreat and murder someone on broad daylight especially for a crime that is relatively petty? This isn't even left or right, this is just basic human rights and the fact that you said it is ""accidental"" shows what your bias is.

It doesn't matter if it was ""recorded clear as day"". Context matters.

The cop that caused Floyd to die was an idiot who didn't quite know when too much was too much. But that doesn't mean his actions in theory weren't entirely valid.

Floyd was a career criminal, high on meth and fetanyl, had just committed multiple crimes (he admitted to using fake money, drove their completely intoxicated and tried to drive away), and then when officers told him to get out of the car the former bouncer physically resisted. 

Placing a knee on a suspect that you are trying to control is standard procedure in policing and MMA. Literally thousands and thousands of people have gone through the same exact maneuver without dying. The difference is most people weren't high on a bunch of illegal deadly drugs when they were. That's why it was an ""accident"", because by definition, that's something that wasn't intended.

Use some common sense instead of ""accidentally"" showing your bias.",3

&gt;Dude I’m sorry that’s pathetic. I’ve seen countless peaceful protests. Non peaceful protestors and cops have both started violence. But have they all? No.  
&gt;  
&gt;The cops actually laid bricks outside of a target like they did with stonewall to try and get a rise of of protests.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not only that, the majority of BLM just wants black people to not be murdered for no reason. George Floyd? Breonna Taylor? Elijah McClain? Are the people who are against these deaths a terrorist organization or are you just uneducated?

Oh yeah, the thousands of injured officers, the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in various cities, the innocent people who have been accused, beaten or even killed at these riots by supporters of blm and antifa are all figments of peoples' imaginations.

No one said there wasn't peaceful protests. Just because there are some peaceful protests doesn't mean most of them are. [Even at the ""peaceful"" ones that don't end up with teargass, every day officers are threatened and have racial slurs thrown at them by the racists in blm and antifa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=2DYc5G-SIOg&amp;feature=emb_logo). You're living in the nice privileged position of not being in the middle of downtown Portland where people have to actually live with this disaster. Or you know, Seattle, Chicago, New York, etc. You legit seem to have zero clue as to what you're talking about, and are again one of the many clueless people just blinding calling them all ""peaceful""..

Then that's not to mention the many, many riots in which people who support blm deliberately attempt to hurt cops and other people for it. Like [the woman killed for saying ""all lives matter""](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/07/young-white-mother-killed-black-lives-matter-mob-allegedly-saying-lives-matter-national-media-fully-ignores/) or [the guy who knelled on the neck of a child in revenge for Floyd?](https://www.foxnews.com/us/viral-photo-kneeling-white-baby-neck-black-lives-matter-arrest) [Organized groups coordinating to injury cops](https://www.dailywire.com/news/watch-chicago-police-release-video-of-antifa-using-protest-as-cover-changing-to-all-black-arming-against-cops)? How about any of the [other cavalcade of assaults](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/demonstrator-shoots-bystander-at-anti-police-rally-in-utah/) and [murders](https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/louisville-man-shot-dead-at-black-lives-matter-rally/news-story/c6c5666f2c1540c5e9d28916bcbfca99) at [blm events?](https://manilastandard.net/news/world-news/327224/1-dead-in-shooting-at-blm-rally.html) But no, blm supporters only hold signs and chant peacefully. PFFFT. Is there a way I can insert a random jacking off motion into this paragraph? What a crock of shit. These are the protests that people claim are ""peaceful"" because CNN and Facebook don't share them with their brainwashed masses.

Floyd was a career criminal previously arrested for armed robbery, dealing drugs, numerous thefts and other crimes, who died while resisting arrest, after using fake money, driving while intoxicated and had both meth and fetanyl in his system. He was a danger to himself and others and died because a cop didn't know what he was doing, but Floyd brought it on himself in both his condition and actions and not a single person should give a shit. Obviously nothing to do with his race.

Taylor died because her idiot boyfriend shot at police after they identified themselves. The problem was that they were at the wrong house. But breaking down a door and apologizing is different than breaking down a door and just murdering someone. She'd be alive if her dumbass boyfriend didn't decide to shoot at everyone. Not a single cop knew any of her or her boyfriend's races before coming in the house.

McClain's death is inconclusive, as it was also determined by autopsy it could have been a drug reaction or asthma. Again, it looking like the cops were heavy handed doesn't at all meant that they killed him. If it was it was accidental and not due to his race.

Now that you're done cherry picking the controversial but still not at all apparently ""racists"" cases, how about we look at the other bigger cases that blm supporter's have rallied and rioted against? **Treyvon Martin, Dontre Hamilton, Alton Sterling, Jocques Clemmons, Micheal Brown, Eric Garner, Jamar Clark, Antonio Martin and finally Rayshard Brooks among others**. You know what all of these names have in common? They were all committing crimes, resisting arrest or actively attacking someone when they died (with guns or various other weapons). In no way shape or form can you look at any of these many, many cases blm has rallied against and honestly think ""police brutality"". A smart person couldn't even apply ""racism"" to them, unless the only factor in consideration is their skin colour (which of course it is, nothing else matters to the racists in blm). The vast majority of these deaths were both legally justified and socially understood by the grown-ups. If you do somehow think all of these were the fault of the police and not the criminals hurting people, clearly you aren't actually educated on these cases whatsoever, you only care about pushing a political agenda and you're only mimicking the lies about these men being ""murdered"".

**So yes, anyone who riots and rallies and supports blm because of cases like these, they are only martyring criminals for the political cause and I do think they are supporting terrorists. And that's because they are.**

**I refuse to be socially or legally forced to support criminals just because they died being black, having mostly brought it upon themselves through their violent actions. Anyone who does blindly support these thugs is either an idiot, virtue signalling or a lawless heathen themselves.**

For some reason as a collective society we seem to have lost sight that correlation does not mean causation. Everyone has simply latched on to a vague notion that ""racism"" causes everything, including every death a black person brings upon themselves. No person in their right mind would attack a police officer and expect good results, why do we pretend these people died innocently? Because Twitter and Facebook told you so?

We must come to terms with the hard truth, that black people who have more instances of death or violent intervention from police is not a result of rampant racism, but of the very real fact that black people commit more crimes and statistically will have violent encounters at a higher rate. And yet according to adjusted ratios, white people STILL are more likely to die from police. It's only then can we have a true conversation about racism and not a moment sooner, because every conversation otherwise are based on false pretenses. Solutions can not be built on lies. 

If any of the organizations and rioters actually cared about Black Lives Mattering, then they would be focusing on the real tragedies occurring within their own communities. Such as the uncontrolled black-on-black violence, drug use and absentee fathers, and not whatever viral case makes the news. Which are not only historical issues within the black community, but ones that continue to persist and people like you ignore because those don't let you virtue signal. None of which are being discussed anymore in lieu of supposed ""police brutality"".

The conversations about systemic racism have been wrong on many levels, including the bad faith premise. Including pretty much all of your feelings on the matter. 

Edit: Also the ""agent provocateur"" nonsense of cops are right-wing groups leaving out bricks for protesters is not only completely unfounded but it's also idiotic. How many more conspiracy theories do you actually believe?",0

Well your personal belief is wrong. Fenanyl is incredibly quick acting, and if he OD'd from it, it would've been within minutes of him taking it. The fact that he was able to beg for his life for the first few of the 8 minutes that the officer had his knee on his neck is proof enough that it wasn't the fent that killed him. The way opiate overdose kills through respiratory depression it that it inhibits some chemo receptors that are responsible for unconscious breathing.

 [Com a subida de Jair Bolsonaro ao ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/)[poder](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/), mais do que tempos conservadores, vivemos tempos reacionários. Sua franja mais radical se comunica por uma simbologia sincrética, que remete ao imaginário de uma “civilização judaico-cristã ocidental” pré-iluminista, baseada em um ideal de uma comunidade de base local, hierárquica e religiosa.

 [Os reacionários de hoje se imaginam nobres cavaleiros templários, que deixam a família para lutar contra os hereges esquerdistas, muçulmanos ou chineses](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2020/06/por-que-assistimos-a-uma-volta-do-fascismo-a-brasileira.shtml). Na América, que não teve Idade Média, os conservadores norte-americanos adaptaram aquela utopia à sua realidade —recorreram à mitificação das comunidades coloniais, ao cenário agreste do faroeste e à memória dos estados sulistas, identificados com o agrarismo e a escravidão.

 [No Brasil, onde até o conservadorismo é importado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/06/cruzada-conservadora-de-bolsonaro-so-faz-sentido-no-twitter-diz-autor-conservador.shtml), os reacionários encontram maiores dificuldades. No fundo, sua utopia remonta à mitologia bandeirantista do século 18, para quem a boa sociedade era formada por senhores de engenho paternais e bandeirantes intrépidos. Na prática, eles fazem uma incrível salada de personagens e símbolos, que remetem ao regime militar e ao Império.

  É dessa apropriação do imaginário imperial no debate contemporâneo que trata este artigo, [ampliando a discussão travada por colegas na Ilustríssima da semana passada.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2020/07/nostalgia-do-imperio-e-fantasia-reacionaria-do-bolsonarismo-dizem-historiadores.shtml)

 A história política tradicionalmente oscila entre dois registros. O primeiro é o da “história pragmática”, cujo propósito é mais normativo que descritivo. A fidelidade aos fatos, aqui, importa menos que uma narrativa de caráter moral, que chame a atenção dos vivos para a importância de determinados valores.

 O segundo registro possível é aquele de uma “história compreensiva”, que revela as singularidades e complexidades do passado, sem imediato compromisso com o presente. No registro dessa história, ao contrário do anterior, não estamos reduzidos a optar de forma dicotômica sobre a positividade ou a negatividade de regimes políticos extintos —os mais remotos, pelo menos—, conforme nos filiemos à esquerda ou à direita.

 No caso em questão aqui,[ a decidir se o Império foi o maravilhoso reinado de dom Pedro 2º](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2015/08/1668705-as-viagens-de-pedro-2-ao-oriente-medio.shtml), o magnânimo, [ou o horror do latifúndio escravista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/09/onde-houve-ser-humano-houve-escravidao-diz-laurentino-gomes.shtml). Por essa perspectiva de uma história compreensiva, portanto, é que gostaria de discutir certas premissas das narrativas historiográficas ideológicas brasileiras.

 Como estudioso do século 19 e do começo do século 20, confesso meu espanto pela tendência de sempre examinar o Império e a República como se estivéssemos em um eterno plebiscito entre os dois regimes. No que diz respeito especificamente ao período monárquico, as incompreensões são tão numerosas quanto os elogios desnecessários.

 Há uma série de fenômenos atribuídos à monarquia que, vistos de perto, nada tem a ver especificamente com essa forma de governo. [O atual saudosismo conservador pelo Brasil Império é um deles.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/07/o-imperio-contra-ataca-e-ganha-espaco-na-cultura-do-governo-bolsonaro.shtml)

 Os conservadores americanos idealizam o período dos pais fundadores da República, ao passo que os argentinos e chilenos idealizam suas repúblicas oligárquicas da virada do século. Não houvesse monarquia aqui, os conservadores brasileiros idealizariam algum período republicano.

 A referida tendência a opor o Império à República passa a ilusão de regimes estanques. [Não faz sentido, porque não houve uma monarquia, mas várias](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/11/conheca-a-arvore-genealogica-da-familia-imperial-expulsa-do-brasil-ha-130-anos.shtml): absoluta sob João 6º, representativa sob Pedro 1º, parlamentarista sob Pedro 2º. Monarquia que foi conservadora em sua primeira metade e progressista na segunda.

 [Esquecemos frequentemente que também houve várias repúblicas no Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/11/novos-livros-discutem-o-sonho-da-republica-que-acabou-em-rascunho.shtml): ditatoriais sob Deodoro/Floriano, o Estado Novo e o regime militar; oligárquica na República Velha; e democratizantes ou democráticas, como as de 1946 e 1988.

 O regime de governo, em si mesmo, pelo simples fato de ter coroa ou faixa presidencial, não diz nada de específico sobre seu conteúdo. Arábia Saudita, Tailândia e Grã-Bretanha são monarquias. França, Paraguai e Síria são repúblicas. O que isso diz sobre questões como liberdade e igualdade? Nada.

 A essência supostamente conservadora atribuída ao Império nesse plebiscito também é discutível. [Houve liberais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2020/03/liberalismo-primitivo-de-guedes-nao-leva-a-crescimento-diz-lara-resende.shtml) (Rui Barbosa e [Joaquim Nabuco](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fol/brasil500/zumbi_25.htm)) e socialistas (Barata Ribeiro e Lima Barreto), para quem as últimas décadas do período monárquico foram mais progressistas que a Primeira República.

 Por outro lado, vários republicanos conservadores (como Carlos Peixoto) e positivistas (como Carlos Maximiliano) recriminaram o Império por ter sido liberal demais, permissivo demais em matéria de liberdade de imprensa e de costumes políticos.

 O maior dos reacionários brasileiros,[ Jackson de Figueiredo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/ruycastro/2019/11/tiranetes-de-maus-bofes.shtml), era na década de 1920 um ultramontano republicano, condenando a defunta monarquia brasileira por seu excesso de liberalismo. Qual desses impérios foi o “verdadeiro”? Provavelmente os dois, o conservador e o liberal, que existiram em épocas diferentes. O único que não existiu foi o império reacionário, justamente este que, ironicamente, anda nos corações da direita radical.

 Nesse plebiscito eterno, esquece-se frequentemente que, para os moderados ou centristas do século 19, as diferenças entre os dois regimes eram muito menores que hoje se imagina. [O grande modelo político de civilização era a monarquia britânica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2020/05/escandalos-abalam-papel-de-familias-reais-britanica-e-espanhola.shtml) e, por isso, eles viam monarquias constitucionais como espécies de repúblicas coroadas.

 Na América hispânica, [vários países se tornaram repúblicas por falta de opção](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2015/08/1675112-biografia-reve-trajetoria-do-heroi-venezuelano-simon-bolivar.shtml), por não terem um príncipe à mão. Os mexicanos tentaram duas vezes o regime monárquico, e vários argentinos e chilenos também cogitaram a solução, não porque tivessem um fetiche por cetros e mantos, mas porque, no meio da guerra civil, achavam que um monarca teria mais condições de criar uma ordem nacional estável do que um presidente.

 Modernas teorias do desenvolvimento ou mudança política destacam a dificuldade de proporcionar uma ordem poliárquica quando não há regras prévias sobre os limites do conflito entre competidores pelo poder, que só podem ser conferidas pelo sentimento prévio de pertencimento a uma mesma comunidade. Em outras palavras, o imperativo de integração precede aquele de participação e de redistribuição.

 [Como o crescimento econômico depende da estabilidade, o Brasil cresceu pouco durante a primeira metade do século 19](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/viniciusmota/2019/07/brasil-retoma-a-lentidao-do-seculo-19.shtml). Empobrecida e destroçada pelas guerras civis, toda a região da América Latina cresceu pouco até 1860/1870, época em que os capitais estrangeiros começaram a fluir. Nada a ver, mais uma vez, com o regime de governo.

 [O primeiro meio século do Estado brasileiro, sob as vestes da monarquia, não é negativo quando considerado pela obra deixada em matéria de integração](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/ciencia/fe1911200001.htm). Argentina, Colômbia e México, por exemplo, só conseguiram organizar seus Estados nacionais depois da década de 1870. Como república, só o Chile conseguiu estabilizar o Estado nacional tão cedo quanto o Brasil (1835-1840).

 Todavia, confirmando a relatividade das formas de governo, os chilenos, para consegui-lo, organizaram uma república “monárquica”, com severas restrições à imprensa e à participação, ao passo que os brasileiros organizaram uma monarquia “republicana”, com uma liberdade que, apesar de muito inefetiva e restrita aos grupos dominantes, ainda era a menos cerceada do subcontinente.

131,2020-07-25 08:06:06+00:00,"Se vc conferir o livro de Otto Rank chamado The Mith Of The Birth Of The Hero, vc vera que nessa escala ambos amam a mae igualmente.

Todos nos, a partir de uma certa idade, comecamos a perceber que nossos pais nao sao a entidade perfeita e divida que acreditavamos ser quando crianca, mas sim bem mundanos e cheio de defeitos. O sentimento do jovem entao passa a ser a ver o ideal desses pais, a ser atingido - como uma forma de auto liberacao de sua propria identidade que enxerga como limitada a atachada ao ambiente de seus pais naturais - em algo externo e distante, que costumam ser os idolos, o amor romantico por alguem mais velho, etc (por isso que jovens sao vulneraveis a ma intencoes de pessoas que se apriveitam dessa questao psicologica dela).

Edipo, como toda mitologia e folclore, eh a expressao popular de um sentimento que as pessoas carregam em si mesmo sem ter conciencia, mas que sente no reconhecimento das estorias e narrativas que passam a ficar populares.

No caso, quando o pai de edipo abandona a crianca no rio ou floresta (geralmente eh em rios que representar o nascer de quando se sai da agua) e encntrado por animais ou alguem simples de um vila  de outro povo, o que passa a ser na historia como os pais ou ser adotivo da crianca eh na verdade a simbologia dos pais verdadeiros.

O pai e mae biologica na historia eh simbolicamente os pais idealizados, que sao nobres, ricos, que sao inatingiveis e distantes.

No entanto, quando Edipo mata o pai esse ato passa a ser o da simbologia de se livrar de seus pais verdadeiro para conquistar a idependencia de sua psicologia/identidade (se tornar um homem livre). E quando casa com a mae simboliza ter obtido essa mae ou pais isealizados (como o desejo que os jovens tem pelos seus idolos, professores, etc).

Essa mistira de direcao sombolica pode parecer ser sentido, mas isso eh so pq estamos acostumados a ver sentido em logica narrativa linear. Essas simbologias narrativas de mitos e folclores seguem uma narrativa e logica como a de sonhos, que tal como tais historias eh a expressao de emocoes que normalmente nao temos conciencia. Da mesma forma que Edipo matou o pai sem saber que era o pai. E se casou com a mae sem saber que era a mae, por ter sido um impulso inconciente tal como eh o impulso inconciente de muitos que escolhem suas parceiras e parceiros como um subistito emocional de seus parentes, como uma segunda mae ou pai idealizados e que os liberta de seus pais originais.

E essa mulher ter matado os pais quando jovem esta relacionado a todo esse aspecto psicologico.

Essas narrativas do final do imperio grego sao tambem uma critica a mudancas que eles julgavam comona causa da decadencia que a sociedade estava tendo. No caso eh a critica contra a mentalidade e cultura patriarcal que se tornou predominante por ifluencia de Roma (e depois dos hebreus atravez do cristianismo), sendo que originalmente o povo grego vem de uma sociedade matriarcal. A critica eh do pai tentando controlar a natureza e realidade para forcar uma permanencia social, que seria evitar a morte dele, pq os oraculos previram que ele seria morto pelo filho. Mas no final ele acaba sendo morto de todo jeito pq por mais que ele soubesse o que aconteceria com ele, ele nao tem tem como saber de toda simbiose da realidade e natureza de uma realidade. As crises entao sao como a auto regulacao da simbiose natural alterada pelo homem que busca avitar mudancas para se sentir eterno.

O fato tambem de que nas sociedades tribais passadas, a cada alguns anos o rei tinha que duelar com um de seus filhos ate a morte, e que vivesse virava o rei. E isso representava a mudanca que observavam na natureza, como forma de remivacao, da morte e depois da vida voltando. E isso esta tao no inconciente das pessoas que foi expeessada na religiao egipcia e todas as demais religioes passadas, e no catolicismo com a resureicao de Jesus.

Lembrando tambem que Jesus era um libertario para a sua epoca, contra o moralismo, odio e obsessivo controle social tanto da cultura patriarcal dos hebreus quanto dos Romanos. Jesus, tal como as tragedias do fim do periodo grego, pregam uma mensagem de volta ao matriarcado contra as crises causadas pela sociedade/mentalidade patriarcal.

A mensagem de Jesus eh que o odio pelo outro vem antes de mais nada do odio por si mesmo, causado por frustracao. A frudtracao eh o sentimento de quem se sente impotente. E tal sentimento acaba sendo frequente quando uma sociedade passa ter pessoas querendo ser o rei de seu pequeno reinado (a familia), e assim buscando forcar uma permanencia sobre a natureza e sociedade que estao sempre em cinstante mudanca e renovacao. E essa renovacao natural para a simbolizar a propria morte de quem se sente na posicao de poder.

O heroi eh alguem com forte determinacao. Essa determinacao era no passado visto como uma energia que da vida e existencia a tudo, quase como um espirito. O heroi era visto como alguem que tem tal energia em ecesso. Tribos orientais chamavam de Mana, Espiniza chanava de Conatus e hoje a neuro biologia chama de homeostasia.

So que todo grande impulso em agir tambem tem um freio que eh o medo do proprio agir. Pq uma vez a flecha da acao sido lancada nao se sabe quais mudancas no vento levara a direcao da flecha (as consequencias). Esse medo eh o que se reflete no moralismo, tabus, leis, regras, tradicoes, etc. E quem nao tem tal freio sao as chamadas psicopatas. Pessoas que nao tem medo ou remorcio das possiveis consequencias.

Mas o herois nas tragedias sempre termina mau. Ou morre ou com serios problemas de saude, etc. Tal como foi com Edipo que terminou cego e de muleta.

Essa consequencia negativa nas narrativas das tragedias reflete o nosso medo inconsiente de nossas acoes de levar a nossa propria morte.

Esse medo vem do fato de termos conciencia de nossa morte, e tal conciencia eh o que nos leva a costruir uma socieade com instituicoes, reinados ou givernos, religioes e tradicoes, tudo que representa permanencia e simbolize algo que nos eternalize e ao qual nos projetamos. E as pessoas tem medo de mudancas causem o fim de tudo isso ao elas se sentem eternizadas, com se fosse a propria morte.

Isso vem de quando nos,  humanos, passamos a nos  ver desassociados da natureza e acima ou aparte delas, como vindo de origem divina e nao da natureza. Pq era a natureza que antes nos sentismos eternizados antes. O fim da natureza, como a morte dos animais e frutos em um territorio, que simbolizava a morte e o fim de uma tribo e individio, e por isso o tabu de nao cacar em determinas epoca ou nao comer tal fruto proibido era como uma forma de preservar a propria vida. Quem violace por ter forte impulso de agir, passava a representar a morte.

E esse forte impulso de agir vem de pessoas que se sentem aparte, buscando independencia de sua propria psicoligia e idividuo. Eh o heroi que pode trazer muitas muitas mudancas para o bem de um povo, mas toda acao leva a consequencias imprevisiveis que incitam o medo que levam as crises e entao a morte de seu povo, cultura, familia, e entao de si mesmo.",16
132,2020-07-25 02:30:39+00:00,"There are many different perspectives on this. As unbiased as i can give here is how it started. 

George Floyd was killed when a police officer kneeled on Floyd's neck for 8:46. The officers involved were all arrested and charged. Protests about systemic racism have raged on since then, many of which have turned violent. 

My own opinion on the things in between:

Derek Chauvin, the cop who had his knee on Floyd's neck, got his charhe upped from 3rd degree to second degree murder. In my opinion this isna failure of the justice system and only sets up the country for more rioting as second degree murder requires intent to kill someone and there is no proof Chauvin intended to kill Floyd. It was negligent, but not intentional.  On top of all this, it wa revealed Floyd was high on fetanyl, which will not help any murder case. 

Around the country major cities have seen a rise in violent crime while simultaneously deciding to defund and disband their police forces. Meanwhile, these same places are asking for federal money to fix their burned and vandalized cities. Trump fortunately told them no. They made this bed, and if they refuse to prosecute rioters, which many places have done, they do not deserve taxpayer money to fix it. 

In recent weeks after unprecedented support for BLM reached a peak it has continued to decrease. BLM is losing support nationwide currently, likely due to the length of these demonstrations and the commonality of many of them becoming violent.

I dont personally see a case that can be made for systemic racism in the United States. There are racial disparities, but i dont believe these are due to racism if that makes sense. Im welcome to discussion on this, but i haven't seen a convincing argument thus far. If these racial disparities are to be fixed, the move is most certainly not to remove police from these areas. Instead, it is my belief that the police should be bolstered and trained better and made to reup their training more often.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Eu fui pro Canada com a minha esposa com visto de residente permanente, isso é, praticamente cidadão canadense. Visto meio difícil de tirar, mas como eu e minha esposa somos relativamente novos, temos graduação, ela tem mestrado, é professora de Inglês, conseguimos bastante pontos no processo de imigração e conseguimos o visto. E hoje estou de volta no Brasil, pois eu não aguentei a barra. Porém com essa maluquice de governo e população terraplanista, cloroquinista e gado, eu to louco é pra voltar pro Canada.  


Vou detalhar mais sobre como é estar na ""gringa"".  
Ser imigrante é uma merda.  
O choque cultural é muito maior do que tu espera.  
Qualquer probleminha vira problemão devido a língua.  
Se tu não for com muita grana, tu vai sentir falta do conforto das coisas básicas. (Dormi com um colchão no chão por 4 meses, comprei uma mesa usada, mas não tinha cadeiras. Não tinah sofa, e por ai vai, um carro ajudaria muito nesse aspecto de comprar coisas grandes).  
No Canadá, e na maioria dos países colonizados por Ingleses, o horário de almoço é de meia hora e isso é uma merda pesada. Dificilmente vais conseguir 1 hora de almoço.

  
A comida no mercado é barata, mesmo frutas e verduras tem um preço muito mais acessível do que no Brasil se comparado com o salário base.  
Ex: 70 Dolares por semana eu comprava comida pra mim e pra minha esposa para uma semana no mercado. Se tu for jovem e quiser viver de comida congelada ( a deles da um banho na nossa) tu consegue passar a semana com 30 dólares fácil.  


É dificil encontrar restaurantes com buffet e coisa do tipo próximo do trabalho, tu vai encontrar muito pf oriental de todo tipo, custando tipo 12 dólares um yakisoba da vida, 18 dólares um poke e por ai vai. Não é tão caro, mas é que tu vai comer apenas isso se não levar comida de casa. É realmente dificil encontrar restaurantes que não sejam tipo esses de shoppings nas regiões centrais.

  
Tem a questão clima, não apenas o frio, o qual eu gostei pra caralho na real, mas a luz do dia. Isso é foda. No inverno, teve semanas que não vi luz do dia, pois chegava no trampo e mal tinha luz do dia, e quando saia, 5 da tarde, já era noite desde as 4.  
Lá existem tantos problemas sociais quanto aqui. Diferentes, mas existem.

  
Em cidades menores é melhor, mas nas cidades grandes, existem muitas pessoas em situação de rua e com problemas pesadíssimos de vício em heroina. Existem muitos ""doidões"" também, gritam, ameaçam as vezes. Eu vi muito mais do que aqui em Florianópolis por exemplo.

  
Minha esposa foi perseguida no parque na segunda semana em que estavamos lá.  
Mas no geral é sim mais seguro.  


Tu vai sentir falta dos direitos trabalhistas e coisas do tipo. Lá é meio estados unidos nesse aspecto. Eu fiquei meio frustrado com isso. Atestado médico e coisa do tipo só rola em empresas mais organizadas, ""subemprego"" tu fica meio a ""deus dará"".  


Pelo menos no Canadá, esses são os pontos que acho mais relevante no dia a dia.  
Mas no geral não é ruim não. Tem coisas que vai da capacidade de se acostumar de cada um,  e se tiver bastante grana, mais fácil ainda, pois pelo menos tua casa é confortável e por ai vai.  
Notícia importantíssima, lá pelo menos 80% dos Brasileiros são bolsomínion. É terrível. Então não espere bom senso da comunidade brasileira lá.

Apesar disso tudo. Estou louco pra voltar, não pq lá é um paraíso, mas sim pq brasil virou um inferno.",3

Acredito que o principal problema do OP é ter um mestre sem noção e sem criatividade. A falha crítica não é apenas uma consequência de um erro do personagem, mas algo aleatório que foge completamente do controle do personagem. No exemplo do sniper, pode ser uma pessoa ou animal cruzando na frente da mira no momento do tiro (assista o filme Munique, que há vários exemplos nesse sentido), pode ser uma falha no mecanismo da arma ou mesmo alguém que tenha visto a posição do atirador. 

Também a falha crítica não significa que você errou completamente, interpretando a situação, o personagem pode até mesmo acertar e ter todos os benefícios disso, mas ter alguma consequência negativa, como acertar o soco, mas quebrar a mão (algo completamente factível).

Para facilitar a minha vida, normalmente eu crio uma tabela de acertos e falhas críticas e utilizo consequências mecânicas, mas também coisas engraçadas ou ridículas como consequências, como o personagem rasgar as calças perder o equilíbrio ou ser ofuscado por uma luz. Também existem os critical e fumble decks do Pathfinder e Starfinder (o RPGNext tem um app de celular que emula) que ajudam nisso.

Mas mesmo com as tabelas, apps e cartas, o mestre tem que interpretar o contexto da situação, a cena e as ações para criar consequências verossímeis e adequadas ao que está ocorrendo na ação.

Como eu uso isso, normalmente as falhas e acertos críticos possuem um peso nos combates, e normalmente os jogadores ficam na expectativa para ver qual o resultado daquilo. Às vezes quando o jogador descreve muito bem a ação dele, eu deixo ele mestrar a ação, como uma forma de premiar pela interpretação.

O que eu tenho visto nas respostas que confirmam a opinião do OP é que o pessoal se sente ofendido por ter algum tipo de dificuldade aumentada ou frustração dentro do jogo, o que eu tenho a dizer, é que dentro do aspecto Role Play, o revés do personagem faz parte da jornada do heroi, nem sempre o personagem vai ser bem sucedido e em várias situações, ele vai se dar muito mal.

A falha e o acerto crítico dentro de um combate (lembrando que na maioria dos jogos D20 não há essa mecânica para outros testes) é uma das consequências de um combate, e que há outras alternativas para se superar o desafio imposto sem sair no tapa, o que pode gerar consequências mais interessantes para história e menos penosas aos personagens.",0

156,2020-07-23 12:02:45+00:00," O ex-ministro da Saúde [Luiz Henrique Mandetta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ministro-admite-que-avancou-sinal-e-bolsonaro-tenta-desconstruir-heroi-mandetta.shtml) admitiu que pode ser candidato a presidente da República daqui a dois anos.

 ""Em 2022, eu vou estar em praça pública lutando por algo em que eu acredito"", afirmou ele em entrevista ao Programa Ponto a Ponto, do canal BandNews TV.

 ""Se o Democratas [o DEM, partido ao qual é filiado] acreditar na mesma coisa, eu vou. Se o Democratas achar que ele quer outra coisa, eu vou procurar o meu caminho. Eu vou achar o caminho. Como candidato, ou carregando o porta-estandarte do candidato em que eu acreditar. Mas que eu vou participar ativamente das eleições, eu vou"", seguiu Mandetta.

 Questionado se queria dizer que participaria como candidato a presidente, ele respondeu: ""A presidente, a vice-presidente"".

 Em seguida, o ex-ministro lembrou que outros cargos estarão em disputa em 2022, como o de governador, vice-governador e senador. E descartou a possibilidade de se candidatar a deputado federal —ele já cumpriu [dois mandatos na Câmara dos Deputados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/imagem-tecnica-de-mandetta-nao-condiz-com-seu-passado-politico.shtml).

 Em seguida, Mandetta passou a falar como candidato ao criticar a polarização política no Brasil.

  ""Em 2022, [polarização](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/06/chefe-de-direitos-humanos-da-onu-diz-que-polarizacao-pode-agravar-pandemia-no-brasil.shtml), com certeza, não. Se a gente conseguir um grande acordo, um grande caminho pelo centro democrático —não por esse centro fisiológico aí que está fazendo essa nova base de sustentação [ao governo de Jair Bolsonaro]"", afirmou.

 ""Mas um centro bacana, que respeite as individualidades, que eu não tenha que decidir se o cara é gay, se o cara é hetero, se o cara é alto, se o cara é baixo. Você tem que respeitar as pessoas nas suas questões individuais"", continuou. ""E promover a revolução de uma década. Porque essa, [de] 2010 a [2020](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/05/brasil-deve-ter-segunda-decada-perdida-em-40-anos-diz-banco-americano.shtml), foi jogada na lata do lixo.""​

 Em agosto, o ex-ministro deve [lançar um livro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/04/mandetta-assina-com-cia-das-letras-para-lancar-livro-sobre-vivencia-no-ministerio-durante-a-pandemia.shtml) sobre a sua experiência como ministro da Saúde em meio à [epidemia do novo coronavírus](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/07/20/5919-acompanhe-todas-as-informacoes-sobre-a-pandemia-de-coronavirus.shtml). Ele diz que pretende colocar o livro embaixo do braço e viajar pelo Brasil.

 Em abril, Mandetta foi demitido por Bolsonaro após destacar-se na gestão da pasta durante a pandemia. Eles passaram por um longo processo de embate antes da decisão do presidente.

 Na época, Bolsonaro já ignorava orientações sanitárias e criticava medidas de distanciamento tomadas por prefeituras e governos estaduais, ao contrário de Mandetta, que defendia o isolamento social.

 O médico elogiou Sergio Moro quando o ex-ministro da Justiça deixou a pasta, uma semana depois de sua demissão. ""O trabalho realizado sempre foi técnico. Durante a epidemia trabalhamos mais próximos, sempre pensando no bem comum. Parabéns pelo trabalho Ministro @SF\_Moro. O país agradece! Outras lutas virão!"", escreveu em sua conta no Twitter.

 Quando Mandetta ainda estava sob fritura no governo, a mulher do ex-juiz da Lava Jato, Rosangela Moro, [saiu em sua defesa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/mulher-de-moro-defende-mandetta-e-diz-que-entre-ciencia-e-achismo-fica-com-a-ciencia.shtml). No Instagram, ela postou uma foto acompanhada da mensagem: “Entre ciência e achismos eu fico com a ciência. Se você chega doente em um médico, se tem uma doença rara você não quer ouvir um técnico?”. “In Mandetta I trust”, completou. O post ficou poucos minutos no ar e foi apagado.

So suppose i have a 1gram habit.. and say in our fictitious morphone scale thats qt 500mg... of course bringing me down to 50 or 100 would suck. 

But going up from 25 to 100 might just feel good.  This would make it seem that both people have the effect of 100mg when on suboxone but su jectively it feels shit for one and good for the other because of their relativr state.

But even that won't be needed. If the vaccine only lasts 3 months, but you vaccinate the majority of the population within 2 months (targeting the most likely to spread it) - the job's done. 

We produce far, FAR more than enough oxycotin in this country for everyone to have one pill per month (probably enough for at least one pill per week, honestly); we can absolutely make a medical product for everyone to take once every few months.

I was in the hospital for major trauma a couple years ago. Almost 9 months in ICU, 2 medically sedated. I was on some powerful narcotics. 5 mos in I was still getting high doses of dilaudid. It got to the point where the smell of the saline flush initiated euphoria. I would be asleep and the nurses said my heart rate would measurably drop when they prepped the flush, similar to when the drug was actually given.

Getting hooked was a fear. They weaned me off the dilaudid with fetanyl and morphine. The fear was for nothing, they sent me home with 60 Vicodin’s that lasted 3 mos. I could have easily got them refilled but had to make an appt every time. I was too lazy so I guess I didn’t get hooked.

What was interesting about this story was his description of the high. That’s how I felt for a short period after each dose. Getting that 6 times a day was the highlight of my day since nothing else was rosy. The fear of addiction weighed heavily on me. It was a rough period but I can always look back and remember the drugs.",3

Eles pularam de um apartamento em chamas no terceiro andar de um prédio e foram salvas caindo nos braços dos moradores do bairro.

 Um vídeo da cena, filmado a partir de outro prédio do bairro popular de Villeneuve, mostra a impressionante queda. Nas imagens é possível ver o [apartamento em chamas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/incendio-em-navio-da-marinha-dos-estados-unidos-deixa-21-pessoas-feridas.shtml) e um menino de três anos do lado de fora da janela, segurado por seu irmão de dez anos.

 Uma espessa fumaça preta é vista saindo das janelas do apartamento enquanto os moradores gritam de medo e pedem para que a criança mais velha jogue o mais novo. O garoto segura o irmão apenas pelas roupas por alguns instantes, antes de soltá-lo no ar.

 No térreo, várias testemunhas, entre eles alguns vizinhos, conseguem apanhar o garoto evitando o impacto no solo. Em seguida, o irmão de 10 anos pula pela mesma janela e também tem a queda de uma altura de cerca de 12 metros amortecida pelos moradores do bairro.

 Segundo os bombeiros, ambos estão milagrosamente ilesos. Eles foram hospitalizados por inalação de fumaça, assim como outras 17 pessoas no edifício.

  Dois dos homens que salvaram os meninos foram levadas às pressas para o hospital com ferimentos no antebraço, provocados pelo impacto da queda delas. Desde que as imagens viralizaram, eles estão sendo tratados como heróis pelos vizinhos.

 ""Foi muito forte e dói muito, mas isso não importa"", resumiu nesta quarta-feira (22) Athoumani Walid, um dos moradores que salvou as crianças, com braço engessado por caso do choque. ""O que importa é que são crianças e vidas que foram salvas. Os ferimentos vão passar"", diz o jovem.

 As causas do incêndio ainda são desconhecidas. A polícia também não deu informações sobre os pais das crianças e por que elas estavam sozinhas quando o apartamento pegou fogo.

 O episódio de Grenoble está sendo comparado por alguns ao feito de [Mamoudou Gassama, que escalou quatro andares de um prédio em Paris para salvar uma criança](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/05/imigrante-do-mali-escala-4-andares-para-salvar-bebe-e-vira-heroi-na-franca.shtml) pendurada numa varanda de um apartamento en 2018.

You know how they say ""if it helps you sleep at night"" well I guess that fits here. If taking adderall benefits you mentally then do it, just don't abuse it and watch out for the side effects. Guess that goes for all medication.

We can get into other meds that were pushed onto patients for profit, like oxycotin, which is basically like heroin. But that is just for pain and not a neurological thing.

I know we're mostly on the ""it's all medicine"" train since plenty of rec folks use it medicinally and even just toking for fun is a form of stress reduction or whatever. But I think people need to be prepared for every shop to be ""rec only"" within the next few years.

I (16F) have a somewhat rare skin condition called Morphea. It’s mainly harmless and causes harder patches of darker skin on the person. In my case, it looks like I have a big brown birthmark on my leg. Sometimes it feels tight and makes bending my knee hurt a little, but 99.9% of the time I forget I have it. I take a medicine for it called Plaquenil. You’ve heard about it in the news probably, cause it’s the brand name for Hydroxychloroquine. So, the drug that was supposed to help the current pandemic but actually doesn’t. When that news first came out my friends kinda made jokes like “oh haha we’ll pay you 800 bucks for one pill” or tell me I can get my college paid for and that was funny! Now that we know  it doesn’t do anything, it’s pretty much forgotten.

My mom has a friend who I DO NOT like. She’s a busy body, has to know everyone’s secrets and sometimes pokes my stomach and tells me I’m to skinny. She’s just annoying. She was over yesterday morning and I was eating breakfast. I take my pill after breakfast. She started making jokes like “oh here’s the miracle drug” and I was just going haha whatever to shut her up but she wouldn’t stop and eventually said “I’m gonna see how much money I can get for this” and jokingly slid the pack into her purse. I said “Are you stupid? It doesn’t work. Don’t joke about stealing medicine. Give it back” and left the room. Ya’ll she tattled on me to my mom. My mom didn’t do anything but told me not to be so sassy. 

I don’t feel bad about making her give it back, but maybe I shouldn’t have called her stupid and just ignored her till she stopped. AITA for being rude to her?

It took forever to get the diagnosis as well cause my presenting symptoms were pain and stiffness and I didn’t appreciate the skin lesion changes for a few months. 

With the lesions only affecting my right side, and especially the one that (like your back lesion) runs to the midline and stops, I’ve also wondered if there where some element of mosaicism at play. There are some interesting embryologic phenomena that can occur with fetal development that can make patterns of the skin that follow the dermatomes (sections of the skin all enervated by the same nerve). These patterns are called the “lines of Blaschko” after the guy who described them way back in the early 1900s. Here’s an article [that shows some of the classic patterns. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760924/) my morphea is pretty much dead on type 5 pattern. 

Anyway man, I just had a thought tonight wondering if anyone posted on reddit about morphea to see if there might be anyone else like me and I found your post.  I hope you’re doing ok.",1
198,2020-07-21 03:38:52+00:00,"Hi Dooey, long time no see. Its usually not a good idea to discuss medication much at all with a doctor. Talk about your pain to justify the level of medication you need and let them make the decisions on drugs and doses. What you can do, that shouldn't trample on their nuts too badly, is keep pushing the fact that you really only need it prn, and not long acting. They like to think of long acting drugs as ""super versions"" of the IR's, but they would be totally inappropriate for your needs. You could keep your conversation all about your pain and get that idea across without mentioning a single drug name.

Plus you know that comparative strengths are generally meaningless to individual patients. Supposedly hydrocodone is a little weaker than oxycodone, but some people prefer it. They all have varying affinities for each of the 5 primary types of opioid receptors. It's a real individual thing. But that said, as a rule of thumb, ""hydro"" drugs are weaker than ""oxy"" drugs while ""codone"" drugs are weaker than ""morphone"" drugs. Its got nothing to do with the drug they are derived from, its just a coincidental naming convention. So hydro-morphone (dilaudid) would be stronger than oxy-codone, but weaker than oxy-morphone (opana). But you will be the ultimate judge. There are also routes of administration to consider. We usually deal with pills and it my just be my opinion, but I believe transdermal patches are a weaker method than a pill. An oral film however, like Belbuca which is absorbed via the mucus membranes in your mouth (called buccal administration) is stronger than either. I wont get in to other routes since that can cross over in to abusing, so dont go discussing ROA with your docto or they are going to think the wrong thing. But it does matter. For instance there are IR fentanyl drugs (actiq and fentora) that go the buccal route, but this is getting in to drugs that we really arent supposed to know about, that you wont see, like Subsys. You know what I mean. And then some place in the ladder of opioid strength you need to find a place for tramadol and tapentadol. And buprenorphine, although I have reservations about its use for pain.

I dont know if I went in to it too much or not, but they do have PRN drugs for just about any level of ambulatory pain if they are willing to use them. Finding a drug is not the problem. You have to relate the pain to them accurately enough to justify the appropriate drug and dose and then hope they are willing to prescribe it. Since this is only the 3rd appointment, you are probably right on schedule for an adjustment, but the doctor is always a huge unknown. Best of luck....",1

206,2020-07-20 17:34:25+00:00,"Hi! I am relatively new to this sub. I have lupus and have been treated for it for over 20 years now. 
I have seen all kinds of treatment options for various lupus related things. Also, I studied to become a medical researcher in the meanwhile, so I can understand a lot of mechanisms in diseases😬. And that was my luck. The cognitive dysfunction is something that can occur when one has lupus. I have been suffering from that for 4 years. I went to see a psychiatrist for that and the amount of cognitive fails was measurable and it was really bad.

Eventually, I found a scientific article about cognitive dysfunction in Lupus patients, correlated with depression. Conclusion of this article was that some Lupus patients have a low serotonin level (maybe caused by lupus??) which causes the cognitive dysfunction and or depression. The solution from my doctor was, prescribe a SSRI. That is a antidepressant made to raise your serotonin. After the work in period(4weeks) it was like waking up from a fuzzy dream. Im as sharp as im supposed to be now😁😁. 
Easy way for me to test this serotonin theory was to take a weak opiod and see if I could focus better.

I know this is a long story but in short;
If you have cognitive dysfunction with your Lupus, maybe try something that raises your serotonin in the long term. For me it worked wonders!!

Btw im on different kinds of meds;
Hydrocortisone, some blood pressure pills, plaquenil, benlysta, oxycodon(when im having huge pains) paracetamol, an antacid, iron supplements, sertraline (the SSRI),vit D and so on... I have the luck of a therapeutic resistant form of Lupus

Detox may be a lot for an elderly woman but if done properly she shouldn't have much of an issue until the completely jumps off or gets to a PRN requirement. Although depending on her pain level she may need a narcotic tbey mayjusy be giving her something that doesnt have good synergy with her body or possibly other medications. Lyrica and other meds are used for nerve pain so really its gonna come down to her condition and needs but a good doctor will be bery understanding. She shouldnt need to go to like a rehab you should really jusy try to taper her down to a dose shes more comfortavle with or try switching medications they make morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, oxycodone, and hydros in er form as well as if they cut her morphine doen by like half shell probably receive oxy irs, roxanol,percocet, vicodin or another short acting med for breakthrough pain until they get her dosages proper.

Tell them shes having falls and all the other stuff you said they should instruct you how to proceed. Godspeed and best wishes. My geandma jsed to fall like that and one day she was doing laundry at the retirement facility and had to crawl about a hundred yards with a broken wrist and she had a cut on her forehead in order to make it back to the apartment actually call an ambulance because she didn't have a cell phone or a Life Alert. That's the last thing any doctor wants to be responsible for so if there's a problem with interactions if perhaps she's drinking grapefruit juice that can potentiate the meds and make the side effects stronger. Calcium channel blockers, blood pressure meds etc can take some time to dial in with other meds so start with the docs and make a phone call in the morning try to have a socially distanced appointment maybe if you stop by and video call her doc with her you can both talk it over with them and start to make progress that give you both peace of mind

Edit:fent can seem daunting but low dose sustained release patches can be very safe for tolerant patients that require round the clock medication and can bave a stimulating effect rather than sedating.

219,2020-07-20 00:53:40+00:00,"I'd give two answers

* Answer 1: 

To a degree procedural sedation agents are like taking different routes across a city - they all have their ups and downs, they will all get you there eventually.  Maybe with some you get a more scenic ride, maybe with others you get there quicker, and maybe with others the ride is safer

That said in certain situations certains routes through the city are stupid.  If there is a mass riot acros the city you should take a path that won't take you through the riot.  If there is a train derailment don't take the path that takes you over the train tracks.  If you have never taken a particular route before maybe stick with one you are familiar with in a high pressure situation.

In a trauma setting you have a few things to potentially worry about

Hypotension - don't use agents that will worsen hypotension (really all of them CAN to a degree but ketamine and etomidate are much less hypotension generating than propofol and fentanyl/midaz)

Elevated ICP - you would think you should avoid agent that will worsen elevated ICP - and theoretically you maybe should - but there is essentially no evidence that ketamine does this to actual patients in a way that is actually harmful, and it has been widely used in situations where patients may have elevated ICP

Also keep in mind that it depends how deep you need them to be.  Maybe you can get by with local anaesthesia.  Maybe you just need a sniff of fentayl.  Maybe you don't have to sedate hem at all.

Usually ketamine",1

230,2020-07-19 09:26:28+00:00,"Can you imagine how much you would respect yourself after discovering that people are so interested in looking at your body, that they would pay money to see it? You would feel like you're made of gold. Maybe they actually enjoy talking to some of the people who buy. The buyers get something out of it, and whether you go overboard with that type of thing is up to you, and you alone. 

As u/TheJohannes was getting at, it's simple economics. We all act in rational self-interest, because money is survival quantified. The opposite of money is death. There are lines that shouldn't be crossed for greed's sake, but selling pictures of your body isn't one of them. I would absolutely do this for money if I could, because it's easy! It's not necessarily harmful to anybody. In fact, when my life is busy and fruitful, I don't the extra time and interest left over for a lot of porn anyway. If I were in that better place (I am not), I would probably be a ""casual"" porn user again, as I have been multiple times in the past. 

If it were me, it would help me afford my overpriced college tuition, and security that I could undergo a destructive disability without going completely bankrupt and becoming homeless. Can I tell you a story?

These were the kinds of things that my SO worried about before she passed away - her father has multiple sclerosis and she had become homeless with him years before. Her mother starved her, locked her outside in the cold, forced her to vomit so often she developed a painful, dangerous, and shameful addiction to vomiting, that kind of thing. She was sexually abused many times by various people. She was always supporting herself, every day, boldly, independently, with nobody to help. She took care of her decaying father, whose mind and body are fading or faded. Her older brother was strung out on drugs somewhere away from home, or stopping by to steal money or possessions from her, so he could get more drugs.

I kind of thought I couldn't handle her baggage the whole way through, we fought a lot. But we were connected on every level and built a lot of trust. We went through some very intense shit together in our own personal lives, and we were usually there to support each other. I was upset that she wanted to start a premium snapchat, though. She was already posting some lewd pictures on insta, and she kept telling me that it was the same thing but with her getting money, and I couldn't handle it. I was worried that she would be at her customers' beck and call and not like me as much anymore. What can I provide that portions of several men's income can't? 

The main thing was that I was jealous, not just of the people who would buy this hypothetical snapchat (stupid I know), but of her. A part of me wants people to look at me and think about me sexually, but I don't think it happens much. Being validated by people who just think you're attractive, is a whole other kind of high than sexual pleasure. I was so mad that I didn't have that, and that I feel ugly, doesn't anyone understand that I feel so ugly and undesired, and smashed into my gender role? Isn't anyone fucking listening?!? It hurts so much. I am afraid that I will never feel seductive in the way I want to be, that people will never love me, because I am nothing special and I don't express myself. So I said, no, babe, please don't do that, just as a favor to me, I'm upset by this, please no. 

During a period where we are fighting a lot about this snapchat thing, she overdosed on fetanyl at a friend's house. I spent some time with her in her coma, skin pale, never to wake up. Her brain was pretty much destroyed, and her father and I knew how she felt about the unnatural extension of human life. So I said goodbye, and left, and she was officially dead shortly after. 

I still feel responsible in part. I could've done this, I should've done that. That will always haunt me, but I know that's normal, and I know it's not really my fault (there are some details about how technically it is literally my fault that i wont dive into). What does haunt me is how ignorantly and selfishly I acted. 

We had some really big plans and ideas surrounding our future together. Big plans have always come naturally to me because of my family's considerable stability. I mean, I got issues, but not the kind she did. So I didn't understand the value of money. I wasn't thinking straight because I was so insecure. The truth is, she loved me very much, and just wanted to supplement our fucking incomes so we can take care of college, and family, and ourselves, and our cat.

I wish I had an asset that I could use to make money easily. I don't, really, but that's not like it is not in the cards for men in the future. If you don't feel loved and appreciated the way women are, you owe it to yourself and your fellow men to make a better future a reality. Acknowledge that men are beautiful just like women's bodies, and that men are special, and that men deserve the freedom to be themselves and not a stereotype. 

Spread that type of rhetoric around if you actually care, it will catch on and have ripples, and you aren't the only one who wants equality. With respect to gender it is called ""feminism"", but the goal is not to elevate women above men and I hope you know that. And I'm sorry if this is annoying to you in some way. I kind of made it my life mission to be conscious and active about sexism because it affected my loved one so much. Her name was Cameron, by the way. 
Cameron was called things like slut and whore by many an insecure man. Never did they gain something from it, but rather they were planting a seed of hate to avoid their own problems, and those seeds grew into a massive living hatred that burned in her heart, eventually extinguishing what was left of her.

TL;DR

Sexism is fucked up and it needs to be talked about. But terming women as sluts or whores isn't the constructive or useful in any way. Talk about what the real problems are - gender roles, harassment, abuse, hurtful speech... There are a lot of really great things you can do that actually help you, me, sex workers, and everyone else.

I'm also sorry that this comment started out bitter and argumentative, I'm just really sad to hear you talk that way. I actually came here looking for help with my porn addiction, (I've done nofap before, it was good) but the comments in this thread were so naive. I don't know, i was hoping nofap's community could be actually be about avoiding PMO and not middle school slutshaming circlejerks.",3

236,2020-07-19 01:30:06+00:00,"First, let me say thank you for your civil and thoughtful tone. 

&gt;The distinction between illicit drug trade and legally prescribed medication should be pretty clear.

I understand your perspective here and why you might be tempted to make a distinction; however, as somebody who has studied social work and addiction, there isn't a distinction to be made.

I'll offer a piece of anecdotal evidence that hits close to home for me but that is reflective of larger trends.  In the late 1990s, my cousin suffered a bad back injury.  His doctor prescribed Oxycotin.  His recovery took a while, and when he finally was recovered and his prescription ran out, he went into withdrawals and started buying it on the street.  When it dry up on the street at one point, he jumped over to heroin. 

It was about five years before he got his life back together (reasonably) and even that was only temporary.

But that demand for the illicit drug was a direct result of the legal drug.  

And the people who manufacture the opium... well... there isn't always a distinction, especially when you are dealing with overseas sources in China, Afghanistan, ect. 


That point aside, you raise an excellent point, asking how we are suppose to deal with

&gt;a state sanctioned foreign actor shipping illicit drugs into the country

The simply answer it to legalize it. There is only an underground market for the drugs because the American government has created an underground market for drugs and a demand for drugs as a result of their weak social welfare programs. 

The drug trade is complicated, but the answer to your question is actually simply.

1. Stop the 'war on drugs'. This 'war' has cost over a trillion dollars, led to countless lives lost, and sees a slightly higher or equal usage rate now as when it started. In short, it has been an utter failure. 
2. Legalize and regulate all drugs.  It may sound crazy, but in Switzerland, they legalize heroin, opened up clinics where people could inject it, and SO many problems disappeared.  In five plus years there was not one overdose; the crime rates (theft, prostitution dropped), the people who were going there got access to social work support and treatment, and by the time five years had passed, the number of people who were still on the program since it had opened was single digits (though new people had started the program). Drug dealing was dead.
3. Invest in social programs that treat addiction. 

When you do all that, there is no demand for foreign material because you can produce it yourself and nobody is going to pay for shitty stuff on the street when they can get the good stuff for free. 

The entire discourse around this drug issue is warped because the people who aren't handling right keep insisting on blaming other people. Why? Because the people who are handling it don't actually want to fix the issue. 

So shutting the door down to China isn't going to help even if they could do it. A door from Afghanistan or Mexico (as mentioned in the article) would pop up (or some old lady who murdered her husband and started shacking up with a teenage boy in the Ozarks will start making it).

There will be a demand. That demand will be filled. There is too much money involved. The root problem has to be addressed.  The finger pointing isn't going and nationalistic media propaganda that blame the problem on other countries isn't going to change that. At best, it will simply force distributors to find new sources or means of transport. And that is the BEST case scenario.",1

Opium usage was happening in China since the 7th century.  Fuck that's a long time ago!  It got recreational in the 1600-1700's.  Still, a looooong fucking time ago.  
         
What I find interesting, the Americans wanted silk, tea, and furniture, but not much else.  The Chinese wanted American goods (firs, ginseng, and other shit), but didn't have a comparable trade level.  So the US followed the UK's lead, learning that they can get opium into the country illegally.  Fair game for balanced trade I guess?
       
Back to the point tho.  Fentenyl is a death sentence, and should be treated as such.  Sure, you can OD on opium depending on the intake method.  But it's comparing apples and atom bombs.

El problema es que reduces tu fuerza de trabajo significativamente, la salud general de la población y muchas otras cosas.

También está el problema de que la mayoría de los adictos empiezan a valorar menos las reglas y leyes (tanto sociales como judiciales) que la posibilidad de conseguir más droga.

Además, está el problema de que una vez que sea completamente legal, se hará un mercado enorme, mucho más grande de lo que es ahora. Imagínate ir a un supermercado y que te vendan heroina lista para consumo (como las epi-pen) y de pura curiosidad la probaras. Entonces, es bastante probable que te conviertas en adicto, porque [es posible convertirse en adicto en el primer intento](https://www.addictioncenter.com/community/addicted-heroin-first-try/).

247,2020-07-18 14:53:55+00:00,"My ex-wife started using a dark net market every weekend to get party supplies. It went fine for a couple of years. Only 2 or 3 packages didn't turn up. The problems only really started when it escalated to buying coke, oxycotin and then inevitably heroin.

Got a knock at the door one morning and I knew immediately it was the police since packages had stopped arriving the past week. I knew something wasn't right as the vendor had disappeared a few days earlier. 

The detective didn't have a warrant but I just took the fall for my ex since she would've been deported otherwise as a foreign national. I said I only ordered benzodiazipines which I showed him (a legit) prescription for, citing the fact it worked out cheaper for me (which was true on my part).
But he said that he had info it was for coke and heroin/fentanyl as the vendor had been raided and busted and seems was dumb enough to write down all addresses non-encrypted. 
I stuck to the story saying I ordered only the benzos (again this was true on my part) and expressed shock that it seems they could've been cut with fentanyl. 
I could tell he wasn't quite buying it and so I took a pretty big risk and said ""you can even search the house right now without a warrant if you like? I haven't got anything to hide."" In reality only a meter away from him was a couple grams of coke, amphetamines, and a few grams of weed under a table. Enough for possession charges - if not with intent to supply. 

But thank God after I said that and called his bluff he immediately eased up and was satisfied. He even gave me a ""friendly warning"" not to buy my meds online anymore because it's dangerous. Then he left.
It was only until later that morning that I read the local newspaper headline that 4 minors had died in a park 2 days previously after taking fentanyl laced 'mdma' tabs. 
I put the two and two together and it seemed pretty obviously the detective was following what he thought was a lead. The actual dealers were caught the next week iirc. Holy shit, it was scary though.

My ex was dumb enough to continue to order months after that though but wanted to use my credentials! I said no fucking way.
I quit using as I was going through a benzodiazipine taper and mental health issues anyway, and I didn't need anymore anxiety (or drugs) in my life.
So my ex started using her own and changed the drop address to her friend's house.

She eventually got caught and that time I refused to take the fall. Not only worse is that her and her friend actually tried to blame me! I said I have nothing to hide, I'll even do a blood test because I am clean. They quickly admitted it was them after I said that. They both got charged with possession and my ex got a large fine and a record and so could not get permanent residency in my country.
By that point I didn't care but she begged me to go with her back to her country. No chance. She completely used me, broken my trust and needed serious help.

Needless to say that that was the death blow in our marriage (along with the opiate use, mental health issues on top etc). And looking back I cannot believe how stupid I was for putting myself in so much danger for her and being totally played. The thing is that we were very much in love and happily married for years before the darknet and more than a few bad decisions changed that all for the worse.

The whole drama was scary and traumatic as it caused so much chaos in my life.16 years of marriage down the drain too. 

Now I'm left with some trust issues even several years later but at least the whole experience made me a whole lot smarter.",1

253,2020-07-18 11:19:35+00:00,"Hi OP,

Was part of conducting body for some of 1SIR's battalion level conducts in their 17th Mono. Will share what I know about their culture in unit after BMT. 

1a. If I remember correctly, the current CO would be LTC N*** L***. If you know, you know. He is IMO quite approachable and he understands training safety very well as previously he was a Bde S3 (he deals staff work regarding safety issues in the Bde) thus you can expect that commanders should not be pushing soldiers over their limits. As for their officers and WOSPECS, I find that their regular WOSPECs set really high standards for their soldiers in a good way where if they expect you to get IPPT Gold, you can expect that they will also get it. 

1b. IPPT wise, they conduct regularly for their soldiers to get their Gold (think positive, they want to help you get the $300 incentive), the commanders there are strict on standards, but yet they will cheer you on and encourage you, be it static station or 2.4 run. During one of the conducts, 2.4km was broken down into 2 waves (02 x 2.4km) as the participating strength was huge. The RSM ran both waves to show that he wanted his men to try their best. He knowingly broke the regulations as pacing was not allowed, but to show support for his men, he went out of the way to do so. If I'm not wrong, one of the OCs also ran just to encourage his men. Hopefully such culture continues as the emotional support can be felt during the conduct even by an outsider like me. I believe some of the commanders from previous Mono are still there so be positive.

2. The unity within the battalion is strong. I do believe that they are close-knitted as every infantry unit is as they need that teamwork and coordination is their combat tasks. You can exepct to be close to your section as almost all the exercises those are your buddies that will live, eat, sleep, sh*t and die with you. Thus, expect them to encourage you the most if you ever fail IPPT or SOC.

3. IMO the unit is quite proud of itself, in a good way for morale at least. As the ""FIRST Battalion blah blah"", they want to be first in many things. That is why they have high expectations in everything, especially physical fitness. Plus, they are the only infantry unit in the Div HQ camp, so naturally they regard themselves as the best in an arrogant way, IMHO. The current commander of the Brigade that 1SIR is in was also the previous CO of 1SIR. Naturally, he will expect 1SIR to be the best, because that is where his pride lies.

Apologies if I cannot shed some light on other events. Hope this helps. Look forward to the good times with those who stick through thick and thin with you in the unit. GLHF.",1

Well, for the thousandth Cool Rolex of the Day I wanted to post something special, and this is the most special Rolex I could think of. The excellent site [Oysterquartz.net](https://oysterquartz.net) sums it up nicely:

&gt;In 2004, an Oysterquartz watch was offered at auction by Antiquorum that looked like an ordinary 17014 stainless model with the white gold bezel.  Upon closer examination, however, it was clear this watch was something unique and many wondered if it was a genuine Rolex.  There was no reference number on the back of the watch where one would expect to see it engraved on a typical Oysterquartz.  And the watch contained a heretofore unheard of 23 jewel quartz movement marked ""5335"" with a date function that employed a perpetual calendar mechanism that could be completely adjusted using the crown.

&gt;This mystery watch was never sold because it was pulled when Rolex told Antiquorum officials that it had been stolen from them. A civil lawsuit ensued in Switzerland between the owner of the watch and Rolex. Rolex lost this suit largely due to the testimony of former and current Rolex employees who testified that it was common practice for Rolex to dispose of prototype watches by giving them to employees.  Also, the fact that Rolex had never reported the watch to the police as stolen didn't help their case. The publicity surrounding the trial served to confirm the authenticity and provenance of this watch and ensure its value as a collector's piece when it is eventually offered for sale again.

&gt;Thanks to a former Rolex insider (who no longer works for Rolex), I am able to confirm not only the existence of the Oysterquartz Perpetual Calendar, but give some details about this watch, which is without doubt the rarest Oysterquartz ever produced by Rolex:

&gt;-Approximately eleven prototype Oysterquartz Perpetual Calendar watches were produced.  
&gt;-They were produced in Datejust and Day-Date versions. The one pictured above is a Day-Date version.  
&gt;-All prototypes were encased in 17014 SS cases with white gold bezels.  
&gt;*No external reference numbers were engraved on the cases.  
&gt;*The movement used in the Datejust model was designated the 5335 and had 23 jewels.  
&gt;*The movement used in the Day-Date model was designated the 5355 and had 23 jewels.  
&gt;*The movement is silent, with no audible tic (a marked difference from the original Oysterquartz).  
&gt;*The perpetual calendar function of this watch was patented by Rolex: [Swiss Patent number CH 67](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&amp;date=19891115&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=CH&amp;NR=672222A&amp;KC=A&amp;ND=1)[2 222 G A3](http://archive.is/mVJRg).  
&gt;*[Here is a photo of the 5335 movement](https://i.imgur.com/dG7lZxX.png) used in the Oysterquartz Perpetual Calendar.  Note the lack of a battery compartment.  Also note the Rolex coronet on the gold battery contact.

I took a quick look at this patent on the [European patent website](http://archive.is/mVJRg). It's interesting that the patent is from 1989 but this watch has Luminova, so it was probably made at least 10 years after they filed the patent. I don't fully understand the patent description but it seems like they had an innovative idea to use the seconds hand to determine which function you're setting. Like, if you need to set the month, you wait for the seconds hand to be pointing to a certain section of the dial? Here's the abstract so you can interpret for yourself:

&gt;A process for programming the perpetual calendar of a watch with analogue time display is effected using elements incorporated in the watch. In a preferred embodiment, **the parameter to be programmed is read from the second hand of the watch**. Passage to the programming mode is effected preferably by a special manipulation of the hand-setting stem. If it is required to program three parameters, namely the number of the year in a four-year cycle, the number of the month of the year and the number of the day of the month, and if the watch has a hand-setting stem with three positions, each parameter to be programmed is allocated to a position on the stem and the parameters to be programmed are read from the second hand by allocating to the latter real steps corresponding to stopping positions and non-allowable steps corresponding to non-stopping positions.",1

286,2020-07-16 18:02:15+00:00," A filósofa e escritora [Djamila Ribeiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/djamila-ribeiro/) cresceu ouvindo seu pai, Joaquim, falar sobre o Maracanazo. Ele, também um militante do movimento negro, ficava indignado com a atribuição da culpa pela derrota na Copa do Mundo de 1950 à atuação do goleiro Barbosa.

 Djamila, além da militância, herdou também essa indignação particular de Joaquim. Em 2015, ela escreveu uma coluna na revista Carta Capital dedicada ao tema.

 Na ocasião, questionou os motivos pelos quais [o 7 a 1 sofrido para a Alemanha](https://temas.folha.uol.com.br/7-a-1-um-ano-depois/), no Mundial do ano anterior, teve a sua culpa compartilhada, enquanto o revés no Maracanã, que completa 70 anos nesta quinta-feira (16), recaiu quase que exclusivamente sobre Barbosa, um negro.

 ""Depois do 7 a 1, ninguém falou que goleiro branco não servia. Quando um indivíduo branco comete um erro, o indivíduo é discriminado. Mas quando o indivíduo marginalizado erra, o grupo todo é discriminado. É a lógica de não olhar a individualidade do negro. Quantos goleiros negros não tiveram seus sonhos atravessados porque essa questão foi sendo naturalizada no Brasil?"", questiona a filósofa, hoje colunista da **Folha**.

 Na segunda edição do livro [""O Negro no Futebol Brasileiro""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2014/03/1432213-livro-o-negro-no-futebol-brasileiro-ganha-edicao-em-ingles-na-copa.shtml), publicada em 1964 com atualizações à edição original de 1947, o jornalista Mário Filho, testemunha ocular do [Maracanazo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2015/07/1656791-o-verdadeiro-fantasma-do-maracanazo-morreu-mas-nunca-deixara-de-existir.shtml), escreveu sobre a reação dos brasileiros à derrota para o Uruguai.

 ""Uns acusavam [o técnico] Flávio Costa. Mas quase todos se viravam era contra os pretos do escrete. Assim três pretos foram escolhidos como bodes expiatórios: Barbosa, Juvenal e Bigode. Mas ao mesmo tempo que se observava esse recrudescimento de racismo, o brasileiro escolhia um ídolo às avessas: Obdulio Varela, mulato uruguaio, de cabelo ruim"", apontou o homem que dá nome ao Maracanã.

  Os três jogadores foram responsabilizados especialmente pelo gol de [Ghiggia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2015/07/1656765-heroi-do-maracanazo-ghiggia-morre-no-dia-em-que-titulo-completa-65-anos.shtml), o da virada por 2 a 1. O ponta direita uruguaio correu livre às costas de Bigode, e Juvenal não conseguiu chegar a tempo na cobertura. Ghiggia chutou, e a bola entrou entre a trave esquerda e o corpo de Barbosa.

 A Copa do Mundo de 1950 recuperou uma teoria do [Estado Novo (1937-1945)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/11/ditadura-de-vargas-durante-estado-novo-era-exaltada-nas-cartilhas-para-criancas.shtml), da inferioridade do brasileiro como raça. A derrota no campo era, portanto, a derrota do brasileiro como povo, fruto da miscigenação, de suas misturas. Um processo que o antropólogo Roberto DaMatta analisou como a ressuscitação ""das velhas teorias racistas que são parte dominante da ideologia brasileira"".

 ""Eu venho insistindo sobre a importância de conhecer a origem social da desigualdade. Essas teorias, como as teorias biologizantes do século 19, tentaram justificar uma suposta inferioridade do negro. A gente tem mais tempo de escravidão do que de não escravidão. Precisamos continuar a falar mais desse tema, porque durante muitos anos se negou a existência do racismo, que não era tratado como um problema"", afirma Djamila Ribeiro.

 Reproduzido por décadas, o discurso da fragilidade do negro criou uma mística negativa para a posição do goleiro e ainda habita o imaginário do brasileiro.

 De Barbosa até a Copa do Mundo de 2018, só houve dois goleiros negros titulares da seleção brasileira em Mundiais. [Manga](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2020/01/sem-dinheiro-e-doente-ex-goleiro-manga-e-abracado-por-uruguaios.shtml), em 1966, e Dida, reserva em 1998 e 2002, [que foi o dono da camisa 1 em 2006](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/esporte/fk1106200606.htm), na Alemanha.

 De lá para cá, apenas Jefferson, entre os negros, ocupou a posição em um breve período após a Copa do Mundo de 2014, com Dunga no comando.

 Chico Anysio, às vésperas da Copa de 2006, afirmou ao Diário LANCE!: ""Não tenho confiança em goleiro negro. O último foi Barbosa, de triste memória na seleção brasileira.""

 Chico Anysio era vascaíno, clube pelo qual Barbosa conquistou cinco campeonatos estaduais do Rio nas décadas de 1940 e 1950, no time que ganhou a alcunha de ""Expresso da Vitória"".

 Mais recentemente, o ex-atacante Edílson, com passagens de sucesso por Palmeiras e Corinthians e [pentacampeão do mundo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2020/04/na-quarentena-assistir-a-final-da-copa-de-2002-vira-programa-de-familia.shtml), afirmou que goleiros negros são mais propensos a falhar. O contexto da declaração era a titularidade de Jailson, campeão brasileiro pelo Palmeiras em 2016.

 Edílson, campeão com Dida no Corinthians e na seleção, afirmou que não se tratava de racismo, mas de uma brincadeira que é comum no futebol.

 ""Havia uma piada racista que eu ouvia na minha infância, que negro 'se não caga na entrada, caga na saída'. Isso está muito dentro do imaginário brasileiro de culpar o negro por seus fracassos"", diz [Marcelo Carvalho](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/11/o-futebol-ainda-delimita-onde-o-negro-pode-entrar.shtml), diretor executivo do Observatório da Discriminação Racial no Futebol.

 ""O Jailson saiu de cena sem que se apontasse um problema. O Aranha saiu de cena depois de brigar contra o racismo. O Jefferson disse que um dirigente da CBF [não o convocou [para a seleção sub-20] porque ele é negro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/02/goleiro-jefferson-afirma-nao-ter-sido-chamado-para-selecao-por-racismo.shtml). O futebol brasileiro alimenta essas histórias racistas, que vão se reproduzindo.""

 Carvalho acredita que a estrutura diretiva dos clubes do país, forjada ainda na herança de dirigentes que assumem cargos ocupados no passado por seus pais ou parentes, contribui muito para esse cenário. Um racismo travestido de folclore, reproduzido por diferentes gerações de quem comanda o futebol.

 Em 2020, o observatório recebeu dez denúncias de casos de racismo no futebol brasileiro, mesmo com a interrupção pela pandemia. Em 2019, foram 63 denúncias, número maior que o do ano anterior, 44.

 Para o diretor executivo, o debate sobre racismo evoluiu, mas ainda está na superfície. A discussão sobre o racismo estrutural, que é o que tolheu parte importante das carreiras de diferentes gerações de goleiros negros desde Barbosa, inclusive o próprio goleiro de 1950, ainda precisa ser aprofundada.

 ""As pessoas entendem mais o que é racismo hoje, mas o racismo incidente, individual, como o xingamento de macaco. O racismo coletivo às pessoas negras ainda existe. É difícil fazer alguém entender o porquê de não ter goleiros, técnicos ou dirigentes negros. Aí falam sobre meritocracia, sobre o estudo, vem toda essa balela de defesa ao sistema"", afirma Marcelo Carvalho, que encontra concordância nas palavras de Djamila Ribeiro.

 ""Houve uma cobertura muito grande por parte da mídia brasileira com relação a esses últimos movimentos nos Estados Unidos, como o ""Black Lives Matter"" (""Vidas Negras Importam""), mas não há a mesma repercussão quando esses movimentos são aqui no Brasil. Porque ainda não se discute o sistema. O empregador vai nas redes sociais e mostra o repúdio ao racismo, mas não entende que o ambiente dele é todo branco"", completa a filósofa.",1

There's even shots of police in Hong Kong doing it to Asian protesters. Floyd died because he was high and because he had underlying health problems. He had fentenyl and methamphetamine in his system. He also tested postitive for COVID-19, by the way. None of which the officer could have known at the time.

Such as: Buying from street dealers. Cartel involvement. Buying untested, potentially contaminated drugs (i.e. weed contaminated with fentenyl causing an ODs.). Getting tossed in a cage for 20yrs for possession of something I can grow in my garden.

How many tens or hundreds of thousands of people over the years have grown up without a mother or father because they got prison time for simple possession?

TL;DR: Of course more people will smoke weed... They are no longer incurring all of those government created risks to do so.

Weil man die Anforderungen an eine Diamorphin abgabestelle nicht in dem Maße gestaltet hat das auch kleine Kommunen von der Gesetzesänderung profitieren gibt es in jeder Großstadt und vielen Kleinstädten noch immer Platten (offene Heroin Märkte). 

Ich denke dieser thread zeigt ganz deutlich welches Problem ich anspreche. Es fehlt an einer genauen Forderung zu der Art der Legalisierung von Cannabis seitens der Befürworter, was zum Teil die Schuld der Organisation ist die sie informiert. 

Der Teufel steckt im Detail aber die meisten Cannabis Aktivisten sind mit der simplen implizierten Forderung zufrieden:

Legalize now (I just don't care how)! 

Ich weise darauf hin, in der Hoffnung das jemand lernt das es mehrere Modelle der Legalisierung gibt und viel genauere Forderungen gemacht werden müssen.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

&gt;My problem with what you described, is that your whole article assumes Floyd had ExDS

ExDS isn't a recognized condition by the American Medical Association. You can't prove whether he had it or not because by definition it doesn't exist. However, the erratic behaviors of a cracked out drug user tend to be similar accross the board which is what the term ExDS tends to cover. All that matters in my view, and in the court's view for that matter, is proving whether the officers thought that Floyd was suffering from ExDS.

By all accounts, he was. And this is only further confirmed by his toxicology results.

&gt;, proved that none of the toxins in his body impacted his behaviour.

First of all, stop saying ""proved"". None of these medical experts can ""prove"" a damn thing.

Secondly, from your own own article- He has some underlying conditions” that made it more likely he would not fare well under stress.

And you talk about the autopsy report from his family, right? 

https://medium.com/@gavrilodavid/why-derek-chauvin-may-get-off-his-murder-charge-2e2ad8d0911

&gt;The parallel to our current case does not end here. An official autopsy declared cause of death “sudden respiratory arrest following physical struggling restraint due to cocaine-induced excited delirium.” The legal team hired Dr. Michael Baden, who testified that Lewis died from “asphyxia caused by neck compression.” Baden is the same medical examiner who was hired by the George Floyd family, and made a similar finding. Baden is also the same medical examiner who was hired for Eric Garner, and declared death by “compression of the neck”. Baden is also the same medical examiner who was hired by the Brown family to examine Michael Brown, and Baden found that Brown died while surrendering, an assertion totally disproven by a DoJ investigation spearheaded by AG Eric Holder under Obama. Suffice it to say, Michael Baden has a very specific interest, and a very tenuous track record. The Court will be aware of this when weighing the autopsies.

His family's autopsy report will be thrown out in court because it isn't worth the paper it's written on. 

&gt;You assume you know more than trained specialists, whom you claim to know more than, despite them all revolving their careers around subjects that require an intense amount of learning and dedication to operate in. You seem to claim that despite professionalism, which we revolve our society around, should be disregarded in certain instances based on personal subjective insights alone.

Find me a single medical expert that would argue 11 ng/mL of fentantyl would not exacerbate a heart condition. This is the point that I'm debating because it's asinine to suggest that level of drug concentration will not make Floyd more susceptible to death under physical restraint or that it would not alter his state of mind and actions. 

The articles you're linking me to do not at all discuss the concentration levels of fentanyl when that's all that's going to matter.

&gt;You're logic requires assumptions built on top of assumptions. Basically, a lot of things need to be believed for your theories to be correct. It relies on reject Occam's razor, and the worst part about these assumptions: They can't be proven correct. Assumptions generally require a perspective shift that can not be proven correct or incorrect, and its exactly why assumptions aren't typically used in a court of law for evidence.

What assumptions am I making? I already detailed out my assumptions for Floyd's ExDS. To adjust my verbiage, I'll say Floyd's ""alleged"" ExDS from now one. My point is, a court is going to side with the officers when they argue they took the actions they did because they believed Floyd to be having a drug induced outburst as this is where all the evidence points to.

It is not normal for humans to foam at the mouth, screaming incoherent statements, or slam their hands against hard surfaces. 

&gt; and its exactly why assumptions aren't typically used in a court of law for evidence.

Right, I still fail to see what assumptions you think I'm making.",1

We heard of a patient who was treated by the wonderful health care system who was prescribed 80mg oxycodon, morphine, hydro morph, and fentanyl patches to help fight pain when he told them he didn’t have much pain, but they classed the size of tumour and cookie cutter treatment plans were laid out. No one in our post said we are curing cancer are reducing tumours, but sometimes one inch of relief is worth a pound if a patient has bad side effects from treatment etc. Also the op asked for cbd products to help with their father so our supplier offered an olive branch when we had a meeting this morning and mentioned it.

This is just wrong.  You know that word ""endorphin"" that people always throw around when they talk about exercising and the ""runners high""?

Are you aware of what Endorphin actually means?  Because it's not some made up pseudoscience word, it's actual medical terminology.  Endo comes from Endogenous, which just means something that is internally produced within an organism.  And the ""orphin"" part comes from the word morphine, because endorphins are endogenous opioid neuropeptides that your body uses to block the sensation of pain and increase the sensation of pleasure.

This is the case for everybody.  There are some discipline junkies that fucking lie and say ""You know man everytime I go for a run it's just as hard as the first time, yadda yadda yadda"", and they're fucking lying.  They're pretending because it makes them feel superior to everyone else when they treat exercise like it's fucking martyrdom.  But it's a god damned lie, because cardio is pleasurable for the same reason sex is, it's hardwired into your brain to be.

My skin tone is fair and it mostly looks like a dark tan but its callused and the skin is sorta dry there. I've had it since I was 13 (confirmed via a biopsy of the skin on my hip) and I'm 24 now. So far its spread to under my stomach, my neck, armpits, my back and now my feet as of a few weeks ago. I get new patches every few years. Its mostly cosmetic but as you can guess is severely messed with my self esteem for most of my teen years. I'd look it up and go see a dermatologist about it. They'd probably need to do a biopsy to confirm but it sounds like that could be what you have.",1

 Está comprovada, no entanto, a associação de ambos para deslocar as atenções postas em três assuntos já próximos da implosão: os feitos e efeitos da [ligação de Bolsonaro com o advogado e etc. Frederick Wassef](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/06/chamado-de-anjo-advogado-wassef-tem-relacao-com-cla-bolsonaro-que-extrapola-campo-juridico.shtml); a inclusão do [gabinete do filho Carlos nos desvios de verba pública ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/07/quebra-de-sigilo-da-rachadinha-atinge-ex-assessores-de-carlos-bolsonaro-agora-sem-foro.shtml)que embrulham o filho Flávio e as [350 movimentações de cargos e remunerações no gabinete de Jair Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/07/gabinete-de-jair-bolsonaro-na-camara-manteve-vaivem-suspeito-de-salarios-e-verbas.shtml) quando deputado.

 Esse [levantamento, feito pelos repórteres Ranier Bragon e Camila Mattoso](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/leandrocolon/2020/07/vaivem-em-gabinete-de-bolsonaro-indica-uma-sujeira-muito-maior.shtml), desce a período bastante anterior às “rachadinhas” no gabinete de Flávio.

 Com isso, sugere uma linhagem de práticas hereditárias cuja origem e o centro ficam claros. Uma face da trama ganha forma. A outra, que apresenta coadjuvantes como Fabrício Queiroz e sua mulher, é a da conexão miliciana que não cabe na responsabilidade pespegada em Queiroz.

 A propósito, os vários celulares recolhidos com [Adriano da Nóbrega, em seu assassinato na Bahia, ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/heroi-para-bolsonaro-ex-capitao-acumulava-punicoes-da-pm-quando-homenageado.shtml)sumiram nas artimanhas de polícias e promotorias, indicação certa de sua capacidade explosiva para poderosos na milícia, na polícia ou na política. Ou, sem ressalvas, nas três.

  Mas não é nesses fatos e indícios que o ministro da Justiça e pastor André Mendonça vê incursão na Lei de Segurança Nacional, por mais que possam tangenciar a própria Presidência da República.

 Ainda impregnado, ao que parece, do culto à ditadura, não reconhece nem esta obviedade que humilha o Brasil no mundo: não há como “difamar e caluniar” Bolsonaro, como concluiu a[ nublada leitura de Hélio  
 Schwartsman pelo ministro.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/07/ministro-da-justica-requisita-inquerito-da-pf-para-investigar-artigo-de-colunista-da-folha.shtml)

 Prevalece a razão irreparável de que são públicas e notórias, e não recônditas ou inventadas, as ameaças à vida, os atos destrutivos e antissociais do desvario de Bolsonaro.

 Embora a relação entre a Covid-19 e Bolsonaro não mereça, a meu ver, senão indiferença igual à dele pela vida e o sofrimento dos demais, compartilho a convicção de que sua continuidade no governo  
 será sempre perniciosa.

 Mesmo a pouca sabedoria da humanidade foi capaz, porém, de criar soluções aquém da morte. O problema é que também dependem do caráter e da contenção de ambições por parte de outros —algo  
 pouco encontradiço onde, no Brasil, precisaria proliferar.

 Agora mesmo, Bolsonaro está comprovando o quanto é pior do que o vírus, este capaz de encerrar sua perversidade. O [veto de Bolsonaro aos socorros aprovados no Congresso para os indígenas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/07/bolsonaro-veta-obrigacao-de-governo-fornecer-agua-potavel-higiene-e-leitos-hospitalares-a-indigenas.shtml), medidas e auxílios materiais singelos, é de baixeza inominável. É condenação, por meio apenas de ligeira canetada, à morte e ao sofrimento de indefesos. Crime.

 Ainda não chegou aos indígenas, mas a Amazônia e sua defesa começam a receber do mundo mais do que palavras queixosas e românticas. A floresta arde, em recordes de fogo. Sem estar ainda no mês quase sempre mais incandescente, agosto.

 O [vice Mourão caiu na armadilha e, feito responsável pela Amazônia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2020/07/mourao-diz-que-combate-a-desmatamento-na-amazonia-comecou-tarde.shtml), vai arcar com os futuros ataques que seriam para Bolsonaro. Mourão tem o título, o poder de fato foi deixado com o maléfico Ricardo Salles, que, como ministro do Meio Ambiente, tem vocação para penitenciário.

 Bom, [Mourão prometeu a empresários 120 dias de trégua no fogaréu,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/07/empresarios-encontram-com-mourao-para-tratar-de-desmatamento-credito-de-carbono-e-preservacao-da-amazonia.shtml) no desmatamento e no garimpo. E depois? Depois nada, nem haverá depois, porque não haverá trégua. Salles desmontou os serviços de preservação, vigilância e repressão. Dois ex-coordenadores de Fiscalização Ambiental do Ibama, Renê Luiz de Oliveira e Hugo Loss, deram valentes depoimentos sobre a ação nefasta de Salles e Bolsonaro contra o combate a madeireiros, incendiários e garimpeiros. O governo não está do lado da Amazônia, como não está do lado do combate à pandemia.

 A maior diferença entre Bolsonaro e o coronavírus é que o segundo não tem aliados, nem generais a aplaudi-lo e protegê-lo.",1

One of my only problems was that the doctor gave me hydro morphone for the pain and at first my husband was giving it to me every 3 hours (prescription said 3-6 hours) and by day 2 I was not in this world. Horrible experience. Thankfully I had a moment of lucidity and told him I would not take it anymore, I preferred the pain to the brain fog. He called the doctor and they adjusted to half a pill every 5 hours and that has been great.

What else? I’m afraid I might have gone a little too big with the implants and it makes me nervous that there is no easy way to take it back. I wish I’d done those sizings where they wear implants in special bras so that I would realize how it would feel but my doctor didn’t offer that. Anyway, it does look good, I just feel weird.

396,2020-07-10 17:34:32+00:00,Actually I remember doing trying it just a couple times...but it was knowingly and my dealer/plug at the time told me so... So we had our pure#4 as per usual..but this time he had a very expensive cutter... I always only purchase pure... Then as I am a dragon chaser (foil smoker) I actually like to Mix in just a tad of cut to help the pure smoke better off the foils...so any ways the cutting agent all the dealers/plugs around here use to make there market gear (cut gear at a ratio of 3cut to 1pure) BTW the cutting agent is *Chinese gluke*...(when I use I never buy market but I make my own ratio of 1cut to 1pure)..so anyway at the time...about a year ago now..after scoring some pure #4 and kicking back crashing at the dealers house (who was is my friend) he told me he has the normal cutting agent (Chinese gluke) but he also has a special cutting agent that actually makes the hammer stronger instead of weaker... Now bear in mind this isn't fentadope or fent gear ..its really pure number #4sea... So heaps of euphoria... But yeah mixed with this cutter so real#4 felt so good that must have been the #4...but anyways this special cutter my dealer said he told me has like ten ingredients like potentiators etc and very small amount of fentanyl...now normally any dealer/plug will never charge for cutter..I always get a packet for free if I ask of any dealer.unless they don't have it. Some don't have it at all as some people on buy pure therefore they only supply pure..some people want market (cut) gear tho.and do not want or ever score pure...where as I will never buy market gear. Only ever buy pure...and get the cut separate and mix it myself..and half the time I just smoke it straight pure for the pure taste and pure effect and pure hit that is pure....so anyway my dealer said this special cutter...he can't give me a big packet for free like normal...he said it was very expensive... Something like 80$ a gram....when normal cut is about 80$ a kilogram... And the *special cut is still like 75% normal cut...then say 20% potentiators &amp; 5% fentantyl...&lt;that's just my estimations.. Tho whatever the mix it was very professional...you could tell it had the right amounts of cut.. Must have been fuck all fent but I guess fuck all fents all ya need...also the cut was still sweet but it had a really weird distinct flavor.  That I personally reckon recks the taste of the h..but it was OK... Anyway yes I remember being on the nod very heavy that nite.......very heavy nodding...but becoz like I said it was done rite with proper quality #4 not just weak shit stuff with plenty of fent it actually felt awesome...but yes know I no after reading up plenty about it..fent itself has fuck all euphoria ..and runs out quickly..come to think of it I was thrashing thru the burns as well that note when I went to bed those two nights instead of just sleeping for a good least 8hours which for me is normal after I have had some/plenty good hammer for the night..but yeah seemed like I would wake up Or just nor be able to sleep and just wanted to burn every couple hours...I was catxhing nods twenty four seven for two days ...it was so good but I could imagine how bad it would have been if it was some shit quality h mixed with too much fent ...and yeah sounds so toxic... I feel for you people up top ..especially the ones on here complaining that it is all they can find...trying to do h but ending up with a completely different drug thats fucked bro...a more addictive substance than heroin?

Instead of jailing heroin addicts for example, they give them help and a way to get off the drug and deal with withdrawal. Clears out the prisons, gets people back into society, and helps people. Of course, any crime committed while on drugs is still punished. Their drug rates plummeted with this policy.

These people don't care about the health of their customers and will cut their product with chemicals and more dangerous drugs like fetanyl if it's more profitable. They don't care about selling to minors. Not legalizing is accepting the current reality that the black market is run by these groups.

I will try to use Effexor which has an identical chemical structure to Tramadol along with Kratom to mimic the effects so the tapering will be easier. 3 months of abuse, but 3 months free from depression. Today the Tramadol WDs hit me well. I forgot how it was to live every day in depression and got a slight idea before Kratom worked. In my country all doctors use e-prescription, and therefore can see your history of drugs. If they see you used Tramadol recently and you want refill, they supposed you abused the hell out of it and they will set an appointment 3 months later.

I think if Ellie killed Abby she would have left Lev alone. Why kill Lev, a person who didn't wrong her? In fact, Lev saved Ellie and Dina's life. If Lev was shown to try to help Abby fight Ellie I'm the final confrontation then I could see Ellie killing Lev.

If you can prove that the first Last of Us is a waist of time then your criticism of the game has value. It make sense that Joel would soften to an orphin girl when that girl reminds him of the daughter he lost. Most players were able to sympathize with that. 

Ellie came to those decisions because Neil wrote Ellie to make those decisions. You can't keep dancing around that fact. Ellie is a character written by an author and not a person who can make their own choices. She's fictional. No one is arguing that Ellie's desire for revenge doesn't make sense, if my father was like Joel and died in the same way Joel died of course is would want justice, but would I have done exactly what Ellie did? No. And if I did, I would have died if I was on the same path Ellie was on. Replay the game or watch the cutscenes and see how many times Ellie is saved due to a dues ex machina. The plot is shaped so that Ellie has that final confrontation with Abby. The whole narrative is centered on justifying Ellie's choice in letting go of Abby. 

""either you hurt the person who caused you pain, or forgive the person who caused you pain. what they're forgetting is that there's actually a third option: letting go."" Isn't letting go a form of forgiveness though? If you still feel angry at someone for hurting you then you never forgave them. To endure means to suffer though something patiently, and if that's the lesson then it's not a good lesson. People should do their best to deal with their pain in a healthy manner so they don't have to struggle so hard  to live.

I was getting feverish every morning, I had pain in all my joints so I couldn't work fast enough, I was falling asleep while standing and operating the table saw, and I was falling asleep on my bus ride home and constantly missing my stop. So I'd have to walk backwards for an extra half hour while trying to stay awake just to get home, and dinner was not even ready when I got there. I just wanted to sleep. Every weekend I'd get severely sick again for the first six months or so. 

I quite my job and went back to school to try and get a desk job. I ended up repeating a year because my concentration was so bad. I spent all of my savings on tuition. I also started having stomach problems

Anyway, I got a new job  got laid off after 7 months because I was falling asleep at work all of the time, then got a part time retail job. I kept getting worse and almost lost that job, too. I couldn't stay awake and I became really stiff. I couldn't bend my neck to get in the car without hitting my head, and I couldn't turn my head to backup or change lanes. I thought I was going to lose my driver's license. I was tested for narcolepsy and it was ruled out. 
I continued to get worse and started randomly vomiting. 

I did develop an autoimmune disease called morphea, which is incurable but not deadly. So I tried a really outside of the box treatment since I figured I had nothing to lose. It was a gluten free diet. The gluten free diet changed my life. It relieved every symptom. I thought people that said things like that were lying and it was too good to be true. I wish I'd tried it sooner. 

Today I am 90% better. It took about a decade and I am so angry about all the time that I've lost. But I am so grateful that I found something that helps. Don't give up on yourself. Post-viral syndrome is terrible but it's not always permanent. I wish you luck.",1

Deswegen hier die aggressive tour von mir um dir weiszumachen dass es dir doch nicht so geil und stabil geht wie du denkst.
Du hast vor 3 monaten deinen letzten crack post gemacht wo du angegeben hast dein größter zug wäre 0.25. jemand der kein crack raucht postet nicht in diesen foren. 

 Du entretadierst deine tabletten, nimmst und verkaufst morphium um damit crack zu kaufen. Du nimmst nicht die dosis die du sollst und hebst sogar was auf (sicherlich um es zu verkaufen) und du denkst das ist ""to your credit""? Dein Arzt wird dich direkt rauschecken. 

Du brauchst mich nicht zu verarschen ich bin eh nicht beeindruckt bruder. Es ist klar du hattest einen rückfall und versuchst jetzt ohne Ärztliche hilfe damit fertigzuwerden. Viel glück und gutes gelingen. Ich war auch langezeit clean und hatte jetzt einen einmaligen rückfall. Der sieht zwar nicht so krass aus wie deiner, war nur zwei tage lang und du bewigst dich ja schon seit monaten in r/cocaine und r/crack. Und versuch Mir gar net erst zu erzählen du postet nur aus interesse da. Wenns so wäre würden deine posts anders aussehen. Nicht so bagatellisierend. Du stellst das ja richtig schön da. 

Du setzt deine Ausbildung, deine zukunft aufs spiel. Du bist sicher ein schlauer kerl und ich bin sicher du willst diese Ausbildung unbedingt machen. Stell dir vor die finden Des raus? Stell dir vor du musst entgiften? Stell dir vor du musst zur täglichen vergabe kommen? Du hast sicher viel gutes erreicht in deiner clean/stabil zeit. Setz das nicht alles aufs spiel für weisse steinchen die irgend ein marok ausgekackt hat. Ist doch sinnlos. Crack ist doch die sinnlosseste droge von Allen. Ist doch eckelhaft und einfach nur ne eckelhafte welt. Geh mal nach Berlin oder zum frankfurt hbf da kannste gucken wie die leben. 

Hier, ich weis ich hab jetzt ein paar strenge worte mit dir genommen und war auch ein arschloch. Manchmal braucht man Aber einen der einen ein bisschen zu denken gibt. Für mich wars der sozialarbeiter der noch net mal bock hatte Mir zu helfen weil er meinte, ich wär noch noch nicht hart genug auf die fresse gefallen. Das hat er gesagt, nachdem ich notfallmäßig, mit nieren und leberversagen und psychose/delirium in die Klinik eingeliefert wurde. Monate haben Mir gefelt. Aber seit diesem aufenthalt war ich clean. Bis ich jetzt alles wieder aufs spiel gesetzt habe. Mir gings schlecht, ich hatte beziehungsprobleme und habs wieder gemacht. Irgend einen Arzt bequatscht dass er Mir Barbiturate verschreibt. Mein pola aufgefressen, und als ich versucht hab neues zu holen gabs nur stein. Jetzt bin ich hier 450 euro später. 

Was ich dir wirklich sagen will ist diese fake alleswisser reddit drogen bullshit welt ist fürn arsch. Diese Leute haben keine ahnung und auch du hast keine ahnung auch wenn du große wörter benutzt. Du kennst dich aus mit pharmacologie, pharmakokinetik, und pharmacodynamik, Aber checkst du was so einfaches wie crack Rauchen ist schlecht? Medikamentenabusus ist schlecht? Ja es ist nicht alles schwarz und Weiss. Aber wir können uns diese grauzone net leisten. Vllt in zehn jahren wieder wenn wir andere Menschen Sind. Aber mit was du machst gefährdest du deine situation und es ist es nicht wert. Drogen haben keinen vorteil. Man ist ein paar stunden high und das wars. Und dafür willst du deine master Ausbildung aufs spiel setzen?

Bevor du jetzt hier groß schreibst wir Sind anders oder was, lass es einfach. Wir Sind wahrscheinlich die ähnlichsten substitutionspatienten in ganz DE. ich komme auch nicht von der heroinwelt oder see IV welt, Mir wurde oxycodon legal verschrieben. Ich hab alle möglichen therapien und substitutionstherapien gemacht. Ich bin Bei jedem arzt der lieblingspatient weil die alle denken Ich wär stabil und unkompliziert genauso wie du. Aber es ist bullshit. Es ist alles verarsche. 

Ich will dass du dir dass hier durchliest und dir mindestens überlegst sachen anders zu machen. Ich verstehe dass du vllt grade net so viele probleme mit deinem konsumsverhalten hast (wobei ich wette Dass du dir dass auch gut schönredest). Überleg dir, dein medikament so zu nehmen wie du es sollst. Lass crack weg es ist die sinnlosseste dümmste droge überhaupt und wenn du Mir net glaubst geh zum hbf.

This is sort of like one of those ""Based on Real Events"" but where the ""names and identities have been changed to protect the real life living characters"" What you can do to everything i have written is simply add a penis to it.

Things got more interesting when my significant other Miss Hyde (I'm Dr. Jekyll and she's my polar opposite Miss Hyde, but in a good way, much more stable, responsible, serious, good with money, skeptical, keeps me grounded) She decided to begin editing and contributing writing and illustrating/adding diagrams, and adding her graven image (her photos) to future posts. So the Duchess Von D (who now ""Stands Up When she Pees:) is also accompanied by a co-author who has a vagina, fertile ovaries (they;ve been tested, they work well) and isn't afraid to grab my guardrail and gets down on her knees.   But i'm not here to tease, so I will continue addressing your other comments.

My monograph on fentayl is a 10 chapter book. I could carry on a conversation for days with fentanyl. 

But i'm glad we're back to chemistry. I always preferred science over politics. I'm an example of a guy who, ffomr age 18, has just wanted to spend every waking moment on different opioid projects. I get high on the produt, of course, but getting high on the accomplishment, of pulling off the whole thing clandestinely, the big fuck you the govt. It's all incredibly appealing. Its an adventure. An adventure with a huge buzz.

Fentanyl was viewed as the only solution to my problem of being hopeless addicted w/ a very high tolerance to various diphenylpropylamines. By 2009 i had synth methadone, isomethadone, phenadoxone, dipipanone and the two moramides (racemoramide and dimethylmoramide). I had settled on dipipanone b/c of its relative ease of synth (compared to the moramidesw, which were technically superior in euphoria, but there is a cost-benefit analysis, and the cost of time and effort was not worth the boost to euphoric index. Dipipanone was well better than heroin and so was isomethadone.

But I was on a dose of near 400 mg. It seemed as if there was no way for me to step down. That is, unless, i synthed something shorter acting and of a different structural class, thereby allowing for incomplete cross tolerance, so i could use alternating weeks of fent, isomethadone, dipipanone, etc. back and forth to rotate and ratchet myself down the Opioid Tolerance Stepdown Ladder. (a concept ill write about in future posts). 

In 2009, an era prior to bitcoin, much less the DNM, (tor may have been developed but there was limited use of the dark net as a marketplace for contraband), you went to alibaba (back when it was cool and you could basically buy and sell ANPP to fentanyl to benzos to anything you wanted...a nice llittle free for all) and you posted ""Dear Santa, Molly wanta a set of those Russian nesting dolls, and also a Kilogram of NPP. Preferrably, she'd like it for under $2000. Please contact her for a quote. She'll considering paying for shipping, but only if Rudolf promises not to leave his little glowing red turds on our roof. Daddy sad he's gonna kill that ""fucking deer"" if he keeps getting reindeer shit on his hands every time he has to clean out the gutters.""

You could also just settle for straight ANPP, but usually at $25/gram. SO the NPP at$1-2/g was inexpensive and cheap. THe remaining equipment and reagents ran about $1000. So all told, you pay $2000-3000 for your first Kilogram of NPP. With Sigfried method, you can expect maybe 400 grams of very pure fentanyl via this method. 

The one-pot method for fentayl (PK Gupta) is garbage and not even worth trying. I think Gupta is full of shit and all of hit patents are just clandestine clickbait. I wasted six months trying his methods until finally deciding to stop chasing this Indian (like a cowboy) and simply acquiring the NPP for the Sigfried.

The sigfried details are well documented on the The Hive/Rhodium archives. Therefore I will forgo them here. But i can tell you that in 2013, J. Pease et al. (https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130281702A1/en) developed a revolutionary new and simplified route to fentanyl that required no heat and only two steps. Very Simple and very portable and basic. The only requirement i access to the speceialized reducing agent PEMB or pyridine-borane complex. So you will need to source from Asia or from a domestic firm. Neither of these are problematic as they are merely creative borane reducing agents and not conventionally associated with fentanyl, so there's no risk.

Now where this gets particularly interesting is when I applied Pease et al. (2013) synthesis method to the 3-methyl-NPP and began 3-methylfentnayl in bulk. The four stereoisomers of 3MF are highly dependent on the reductive amination process used. their ratios can be varied significantly by changing reducing agents and thus the use of pyridine borane was an as yet unused and untested reducing agent on 3MF formation. How would it effect the formatino of different stereoisomers? Well, that would be something i would investigate and the results would be very interesting from both a chemical and pharmacological Perspective. But you;lll have a wait for the official writeup entitled ""Duchess VOn D's 3-Methyl Mystery....""",1

Why extract it like this. You're at least abusing it. Either snorting it or sticking it in ur ass. It's supposed to be a slow release formulation. You are not complying with your therapy and your doctor would boot you or insist on a detox. 

Verarsch mich nicht und verarsch dich selbst nicht. Du sagst ""methadon ist keineswegs eine Therapie/clean sein"" Aber es gibt so viele metha/pola patienten die stabiler Sind als du.

Ich finde nicht das substitutol Eine schlimme sache ist. Im gegenteil. Es ist zwar schlimm das es so einfach missbraucht werden kann und die sollten die formulation ändern. Aber ich werde Es nicht akzeptieren dass ein junky wie du jegliche methadonpatienten beleidigt und ""invalidated"". Du bist weder Arzt noch stabliler patient und wenn dein Arzt wüsste was du mit deinen pillen machst würde er disziplinarische Maßnahmen einleiten. 

Jedes substitutionsmittel hat vor und nachteile. Die kurze halbwertszeit Bei substitol ist in der hinsicht von entgiftungen ein vorteil, in der hinsicht von compliance-problemen ein nachteil. Es ist viel, viel missbrauchbarer als metha und pola, es ist die einfachste pille die ich jeh geballert hab. Die Sind praktisch dafür gemacht. Und wenn man keine mikrofilter hat (welcher junky hat schon geld/ahnung dafür?) Dann kommt talkum in die lunge und man kann sich nach einer weile vom leben verabschieden.  Also substitutol hat tatsächlich, vor allem Bei instabilen patienten wie du, große nachteile. Du solltest Eine entgiftung machen und dann wahrscheinlich das substitut wissen.

Weisst du woher ich dass alles weis? Ich war auf jedem substitutionsmittel ausser diamorphin. Meine substitoldosis war auch viel höher als deine. Wie du hab ich geglaubt ich könne den Arzt mal schell verarschen und Mir ein geilen hit draus machen. Aber am ende verarscht man nur sich selbst. Wenn du es unretadiert nimmst wird es dir irgendwann nicht reichen. Du kommst in die perdoullie. Hör auf damit und verkack nicht deine substitionstherapie.

Ich war jetzt 9 monate clean und hab einen rückfall gebaut. Diese 9 monate hätte ich ohne pola nie geschafft. Und dank pola wird es jetzt viel einfacher wieder in den Rahmen reinzukommen als es mit subtitol jeh wäre.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

&gt;The distinction between the truth and JK's mischaracterisation is important - because \*no one\* is arguing that sex is not determined by biology.

And then goes on to posit that biology supports the notion of non-binary sex:

&gt;Biology understands that sex is a multi-faceted issue. It is not binary - but bimodal

This is simply untrue from a biological perspective. You won't find a single legitimate paper that would ever suggest this.

I see people bending and redefining scientific terminology under the precedent that ""meaning of words can change"". Not when they are scientific terms. That process is far more rigorous than a tweet going viral.

&gt;Are you normally opposed to evidence based treatment?

You know what used to be considered evidence based treatment not too long ago? Methamphetamine and tobacco. Today we still prescribe Oxycotin for pain relief because ""evidence shows it relieves pain"".

444,2020-07-07 17:12:23+00:00,"Dat harddrugs veel heftiger zijn dan ""een jointje oid"" is niet per se waar. Veel hard drugs zijn en minder gevaarlijk en minder verslavend dan alcohol, tabak of wiet, terwijl deze op het moment legaal of gedoogd zijn. terwijl bijvoorbeeld ketamine, xtc, lsd en paddo's minder gevaarlijk en minder verslavend zijn dan tabak en alcohol (https://www.rivm.nl/publicaties/ranking-van-drugs-vergelijking-van-schadelijkheid-van-drugs). De grootste gevaren van het gebruik van xtc, lsd of keta komen op het moment omdat het niet legaal is en dus niet gereguleerd is waardoor je niet zeker weet wat je koopt. 

Er zijn inderdaad ook drugs als heroïne en methamfetamine die juist verslavender en gevaarlijker zijn dan o.a. alcohol en deze zouden volgens mij dan ook strenger gereguleerd kunnen worden zoals oxycodon en dergelijke. Maar om dit soort middelen in dezelfde groep te zetten als keta, lsd, paddo's en mdma dat is natuurlijk absurd.

Ik snap dat het niet alles of niets moet worden maar als alcohol en tabak als normaal worden beschouwd en legaal zijn dan passen mdma en lsd daar prima bij volgens mij. Sterker nog ik vind alcohol wel een van de heftigere drugs die van mij dan ook wel in het herziene rijtje onder de hard drugs mag komen.",1

Nixon blatantly only intended it so it could be used to harass opponents who used drugs more than the people he wanted to appeal to, such as black people and hippies. Reagan actively made things worse by funding cocaine smuggling into the US, which especially effected black communities and his political enemies and provided a casus belli to crack down on them judicially, and the US opiate epidemic was almost entirely caused by the American pharmaceutical industry (Lobbying the government) seeking profit, with the following upswells in heroin and fentayl effecting the US today stemming in part from the sheer amount of opiate addicts that became normalised in the 90s and 00s.

Addiction is very useful for the enemies of people addicted (And addicted people are excellent political scapegoats), and highly profitable - The war on drugs is an industry where the victims of it are exploited for both profit and political convenience.",1

447,2020-07-07 11:24:52+00:00,"You're not wrong and not right. First off cigarettes used to be more addictive when the potency of heroin lingered around 7-10 percent. Nowadays with potency around 40-60 on rare occasion as high as 75 percent I think it's safe to say heroin is more addictive today. Two smokes won't get you addicted. Two shots will. Also yes the government has had a vested interest in the regulation of illicit drugs including heroin for decades. And yes they have controlled the stream into inner cities for those same decades. Yes it has to do with race that's why the crack epidemic seemed to target only black communities in the 80's and 90's. Because it did. That being said they didn't predict that it would spread so far when in 96 they approved oxycotin for use of chronic pain and other non-cancer ailments. Then by 2007 when the three top executives of Purdue were charged, Purdue had had hundreds of lawsuits against them every year and in the following years they would be forced to take oxys off the market in it's current form. After that people obviously turned to heroin to replace it.  It became all too clear after that that addiction to opiates had moved far beyond small rural towns and inner cities black neighborhoods. Since then it has reached nearly all parts of the country. It would be irresponsible to say that the government meant for this to happen. That's not to say they haven't profited from it in many forms and perpetuated the war on drugs (especially this administration) but that's a lot different then saying they were complicit.",1

Yeah, I'm not doing these long winded posts for the points but it would concern me if I was super far off the baseline of this subreddit since most of what I read here makes sense to me.And yes, that was the crux of the harm-reduction part of my argument and how legalization of posession and sales would help with reducing harm, reducing prison slavery and taxation and regulation of the sales should go into building treatment centers and preventing pharma companies like Purdue from ever getting rich again off addicting people. The companies who make these drugs should only exist for harm reduction purposes. That's all I'm saying really.

&gt;Drugs are drugs, and they're addictive. Addiction is a disease.

Addiction is a disease and bottom line people do profit from these diseases by selling their clients drugs.

If you are already sick you need help in weaning off you need suboxone and similar drugs but if you are not ready to wean off ( and many people are not ) due to psychological reasons then at least you need drugs that you won't OD on.

&gt;you con't buy emphysema on a street corner"" but if you could, and people  did that, there's a damn good underlying reason why - and the ""why"" is  the problem we're not addressing. People turn to drugs (unless they got  hooked via legitimate prescription) because their reality sucks and they  need an escape from it, even if that escape is momentary.

Yeah, we're not addressing why enough. Treatment centers and free rehabs for junkies would help as would decriminalizing posession and sales/manufacture ( so we can guarantee quality ) but I think a lot of it is not even about the drugs at all.

A lot of kids are growing up not learning how to cope with life in healthier ways and eventually life gets so unbearable that they turn to drugs to feel good, deal etc. A lot of people don't have enough money to get what they need and don't see a way out and drugs are a convenient way to escape. Hard drugs will make you feel good but they also enslave you so I'm not suggesting its a valid form of anarchy.

A lot of us grew up with members of our family who were also alcohol addicts and never got treated. Alcohol is legal and a total problem despite being well measured and even though its a bit harder to OD and die just on alcohol its still a major problem for a lot of people.

So yeah, I'm definetly not saying harm reduction is the solution to the problem but I believe its a necessary part of the solution at least until you can psychologically get your mind in a place where you have decided to quit.",1
454,2020-07-07 05:12:53+00:00,"Avoiding painful movement is key, also try and stay active (walking is generally good for your back). You can take pain medication, but over the counter pain medication doesn't do much for nerve pain. Prescription meds like tramadol and oxycodon do help, but that's pretty nasty stuff so if it's manageable without I'd advise that.

Most herniations resolve in about 6 to 12 weeks, so see if you've made plenty of progress by then. If it's bad and doesn't get better at all I'd definitely advise trying to see your doctor. Getting an MRI is not necessary per se, but if your pain doesn't improve then it'd be a good move.",1
455,2020-07-07 04:53:19+00:00,"&gt; Whataboutism is where one ""attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy"" ( just looked it up )
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't attempt to discredit the position that this guy is a piece of shit. Maybe that wasn't clear.I actually did say that him and his company and by implication him are shit people for lying about the addictive properties of oxy and for making doctors get people addicted.
&gt; 

Ok then - not whataboutism. But my downvote (like anyone cares, such as it is) I took you statement to mean ""well at least their dosages were accurate so, not as bad as fentanyal.""

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I also said the same for the people that mix fent without measuring it out correctly.
&gt; 

Well like you said, they can't. 


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I also implied that the laws that put people in prison for possession are shit as well, but forgive me if I didn't state it directly.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not pointing out hypocracy, only saying that drugs should be legal and available at known quality and quantity so as to reduce harm, amongst other reasons such as decreasing prison slavery.
&gt; 

Here's a one-upmanship. Or addendum if you like. Drugs are drugs, and they're addictive. Addiction is a disease. It is as immoral to charge people with crimes for addiction as it is to charge someone and imprison them for contracting emphysema or cancer.  Some will balk and say ""you con't buy emphysema on a street corner"" but if you could, and people did that, there's a damn good underlying reason why - and the ""why"" is the problem we're not addressing. People turn to drugs (unless they got hooked via legitimate prescription) because their reality sucks and they need an escape from it, even if that escape is momentary.  
Lawyers pleading for leniency describe this as ""my client isn't bad, this is a failing of society"" and they're right - this is society's fault that for some people - they need to escape reality. Society being mostly our government's laws and their narrative that the problem is drugs and the ""weak people"" who turn to drugs. But society is also the corporate puppeteers who are pulling our government's strings. 

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The reason its not pointing out hypocracy is because I didn't say it has to be his company doing it. I didn't state a positive solution for the problem because I just haven't thought of the appropriate way to do it yet.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe democratic cooperatives of pharmacists and chemists would make more sense, not sure.

&gt; If the solution is to happen under a system of government, such as our current situation, I also think they should be taxed and the money from the taxes should go directly into rehab centers.",1

460,2020-07-06 23:31:45+00:00,"Hello I have experience with a few different Benzo RCs and one Opioid RC i forget what its called, started with a E and has a Z in it. Im getting some O-DSMT soon (fused lumbar spine, state took away my pain meds) and ill try to remember to report back. I have a 0.001 scale and done tons of testing with it as im preparing for my report. Idk about mixing it with promethazine but i get it for my hay fever from my GP so ill see if i can report on that mix too.

I only use whats legal and its for managing my chronic pain. And i think the mod is super hypocritical saying RCs are dangerous but its ok to take street drugs but guess what? Its all either stepped on to shit or its mix with or made only with RCs. You'll be lucky to find legit Xanax and Percocet/Oxycotin on the streets. My cousin's husband has cancer and a more fucked up spine than me and even he cant get pain meds. Shit iv even seen fake Valium on the streets here.

All im saying is is that if you're smart and do your research like me and practice safe using you'll be fine. Probably even more so with RCs since you know what you're getting but i still recommend getting test kits since they're cheap (around $20).

And for anybody wondering, no O-DSMT wont cause seizures like Tramadol (200mg+ /day). Tramadol is a SNRI with some opioid like properties. Your body converts Tramadol to O-DSMT. By taking straight O-DSMT you're skipping all of the nasty shit in the Tramadol that would cause seizures.

Dein Argument baut außerdem darauf auf, dass mehr Leute Heroin nehmen wenn es Legal wird. Genau das ist ja das, wogegen sich die Legalisierungsbefürworter wehren. Die Kriminalisierung sorgt nicht wirklich dafür, dass weniger Leute konsumieren, hat aber sehr viele massiv negative andere Auswirkungen.

Although there are a few countries in the EU that offer Ketobemidone and Dipipanone (which are absolute gems FYI), the strongest opioid we have is Hydromorphone and while it /is/ fairly strong, it's nothing compared to Oxymorphone (which I have managed to get sent over a couple of times but it's rare and fairly pricey), which is miles ahead of any other morpholine I've tried.
I reckon Dipropanoylmorphine would be great for the opioid community and all one would need for a synth is a bit of morphine and propanoylamine or isopropanoylamine.

There's also dihydroxymorphine, 3-HO-9-Methoxy-Morphine, Dimethoxomorphine, Dimethlyhydroxymorphine, 3-isopropoxy, 9-oxo-morphine and a veritable laundry list of morphine analogues that are just as good or better than the powerhouse that is Oxymorphone or even Oxymorphol (something so damn rare I've /never/ seen it offered, though IIRC Hydromorphinol is the better of the two as Oxymorphone starts to get a bit Thebaine-ey if you fuck with it too much).

Regardless, the morphone family isn't the best place to start in terms of RC analogues. The better places to look are Pethidines, Bemidones, Methadone analogues, Thiambutenes, PCP analogues and of course Moramides, just to name a few. But these aren't as profitable as fentalogues but at the same time they don't cause death as much as them either.

The RC industry has focussed of Fentalogues for far too long. We deserve better, we deserve proper opioids that kick like a mule. The amount of opioid dependent people on this planet has skyrocketed and yet what we're forced to use is dogshit in comparison to what is out there, unclassified and guaranteed to be far better than O-DSMT or acetoxy-KBD, which they put a fucking methyl on instead of an ethyl which would have made it at least 10x better.

The state of the RC market is in tatters because of Fentalogues and piss poor excuses for opioids like aco-methyl-kbd.

Just look at MR-2096 or Levorphanol and extrapolate from there. There's a veritable garden of Eden of opioid analogues just waiting to be plucked but the chemists piss themselves when it comes to developing novel compounds that aren't one methyl away from the last one they produced.

I'll post every single one of my analogues (500+ and most are STP'd) if I had a guarantee that just one would be made and the rest would be put in the wings for a rainy day.

PM me if you have that capability.

PS: IC-26 was pretty damn nice and also unclassified except via analogue laws. Regardless it's just the beginning of what could be a total revolution of novel opioids. This is the only chance we'll get before it's all legalised and we're forced into using Oxy for the rest of our days, so time /is/ a factor.",1

[You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul)

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Heroin hat z.b. bei Schwangeren Müttern anscheinend keinen Einfluss auf die kognitive Entwicklung des Kindes und ich könnte mit vorstellen dass der Konsum im Jugendalter was das Gehirn angeht relativ vernachlässigbar ist. Wobei ich damit vor allem reines Heroin meine also Diamorphin. Straßenheroin ist nur rund 15% Heroin. Denn Diamorphin ist neben dem hohen Suchtpotenzial relativ ungefährlich.

Grundsätzlich kann man das aber in Frage stellen, denn in vielen Fällen werden Jugendlichen Drogen gegeben. Sei es regelmäßig wie z.b. Ritalin, oder selten wie Ketamin zur Betäubung für Kinder.

I don't think he is going to be sober from here on out unless he changes his view and gets appropriate help.

I don't know a ton about opiates but I do know a ton about addicts and it takes a few tries, a few approaches, and a lot of pain before someone figures out how to stay sober. Someone who is buying street drugs to supplement his methadone is not ready yet. I hope that changes soon.",1

Steile These.

How easily the human perishes before the bulldozer of ideology!

Whatever one might think about the social convulsions that followed his death, George Floyd died, his head pressed to the pavement, crying out for his mother. Maybe maudlin or silly to feel this, but no matter what happened before or after that, his passing should be mourned, and we should care how and why he died. The light of a human being was extinguished from the world.

I find it beyond the pale to make Cause and Purpose out of dehumanizing him as a criminal, drug-user, whatever. Let's say all of it, however heinously formulated, is all true. Still: he died, head pressed to the pavement, crying out for his mother.

Doesn't it make one less-than-human to paper over the tragedy? How did we discard [what we've already taught ourselves thousands of years ago](http://www.artandpopularculture.com/De_mortuis_nil_nisi_bonum)?

I don't mean to chastise or harangue. We've seen few such lurches in the sub. But I worry about bleep-bloop arguments that lose sight of the suffering behind the numbers. Only *so* and *so many* people shot under this and that circumstance, therefore X, Y, Z. Yes, and these *so* and *so many* people were fathers, siblings, sons. 

The take-away from Stalin's [memorable quip](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/) isn't that human death is trivial, it's that a certain mustachioed Georgian was a psychopath.

People lost their lives or decades' worth of sweat &amp; tears in the ensuing melees. Most of this has been left acknowledged, much less thought of as losses worth grieving. 

Less dire fall-out still involves pain: I can only imagine what it must feel like to have tens of thousands of people howling for your head. Demanding that your friends declare your leprosy, insisting that you must not enjoy the privilege of being able to pay bills.

No lo tome tan literal como en el video si no a privar algunos aspectos de mi vida como algunos videojuegos que me daban ganas de jugar como si fuera heroina (eft), tambien use la aplicacion Toggle que la vi en un video de una mina que es super productiva y habla sobre eso  en resumen, Toggle vas creando ""Tareas"" que estas haciendo en el momento y cuanto tiempo te esta llevando en tiempo real, requiere claramente de tu determinacion para no colgar en darle play o stop etc te dejo una imagen de los mios en los ultimos dias [aqui](https://i.imgur.com/Zz5VsFf.png).

547,2020-06-30 23:05:46+00:00,"Well, oxycodone is more powerful than morphine only if we compare both drugs taken by the oral roat. Intravenously, or mg per mg, they have the same analgesic effect or potency. It's important to remember that the whole OxyContin marketing was around the 12 hours scheme. Immediate release opioids usually last four hours and a half at best, so pain patients needed to take a pill every 4-6 hours. They'd go to bed and woke up in the middle of the night in pain, as the effect of the drug they took before bed wore off. An opioid painkiller that lasts 12 hours, so that the patient needed to take a pill only two times within a 24 hour period? That was great!

You could say, ""but they already had extended release morphine"". MsContin, isn't it? But you know the stigma attached to morphine. A terribly addictive medication - that's what heroin metabolizes into, right? The great oxycodone advantage was not being called morphine, having a name that resambled more codeine (oxy*codone*) - a weaker and less addictive medication - than morphine. Purdue took advantage of that. You can bet if their drug was extended release oxy*morphone* not as much doctors would have fallen for their ""little addictive potential"" bullshit. But oxycodone didn't make people remember morphine.

Let's illustrate this with another example. There's a obscure opioid called heterocodeine. Now, hearing the name of it one could think it may be a less addictive and weaker narcotic compared to morphine, like codeine is, especially if the company who manufactures it makes a huge marketing on it having a lower addictive potential. ""Well, it's called hetero*codeine*, and they keep saying it's less addictive because it's extended release, so that there's less of a rush because the drug isn't released all at once, so they must be right."" But in reality heterocodeine in it's effects resambles morphine, heroin and hydromorphone way more than it resambles codeine - it's actually 6x stronger than morphine if I remember correctly.

The same thing happenned with OxyContin. And the irony is that oral oxycodone is even more addictive than oral morphine, because although morphine is more euphoric than oxycodone if we compare both drugs intravenously, by the oral roat oxy is clearly better as it has a good bioavailability whereas morphine don't.",3
