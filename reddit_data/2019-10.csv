Don't get surgery either, they will likely put you on something strong (like morphine or oxycotin) during recovery.

 ""‪Se você está do lado da verdade, NÃO TENHAIS MEDO!‬"", escreveu Eduardo em sua conta no Facebook. 

 A mensagem foi acompanhada de um vídeo no qual o pai dele, o então deputado Jair Bolsonaro, exalta em 2016 o coronel[ Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml), um dos principais símbolos da repressão durante a ditadura militar.

 Jair Bolsonaro fez a homenagem a Ustra durante a sessão da Câmara que autorizou o processo de impeachment de Dilma Rousseff (PT), em 2016.

  Na ocasião, o então deputado elogiou o então presidente da Câmara, Eduardo Cunha (MDB), pela condução dos trabalhos e disse que votava ""pela memória"" Ustra, ""o pavor de Dilma Rousseff"".

 Ustra foi condenado em segunda instância por tortura e sequestro no regime militar (1964-1985). 

 Em [entrevista à jornalista Leda Nagle ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/nao-tenhais-medo-diz-eduardo-bolsonaro-ao-insistir-em-referencia-a-ditadura.shtml)realizada na segunda (28) e publicada nesta quinta no canal dela no YouTube, Eduardo Bolsonaro falou em uma resposta à eventual radicalização da esquerda ""via um novo AI-5"". 

 O AI-5 foi editado em 1968 no período mais duro da ditadura militar (1964-1985).

 ""Tudo é culpa do Bolsonaro, percebeu? Fogo na Amazônia, que sempre ocorre —eu já morei lá em Rondônia, sei como é que é, sempre ocorre nessa estação— culpa do Bolsonaro. Óleo no Nordeste, culpa do Bolsonaro. Daqui a pouco vai passar esse óleo, tudo vai ficar limpo e aí vai vir uma outra coisa, qualquer coisa —culpa do Bolsonaro"", afirmou.

 ""Se a esquerda radicalizar a esse ponto, a gente vai precisar ter uma resposta. E uma resposta pode ser via um novo AI-5, pode ser via uma legislação aprovada através de um plebiscito como ocorreu na Itália. Alguma resposta vai ter que ser dada"", afirmou o filho do presidente Jair Bolsonaro. 

 As declarações de Eduardo Bolsonaro foram vistas por[ políticos de diferentes partidos (da base governista e da oposição)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/politicos-reagem-e-chamam-fala-de-eduardo-sobre-ai-5-de-retrocesso-e-risco-a-democracia.shtml) como um retrocesso, uma evidência de intenções autoritárias e um risco à democracia.

 O ministro Marco Aurélio Mello, do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal), disse que a declaração do deputado indica os ""ares democráticos"" estão sendo levados embora. ""A toada não é democrática-republicana. Os ventos, pouco a pouco, estão levando embora os ares democráticos"", afirmou em mensagem à **Folha**.

 O presidente nacional da OAB (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil), Felipe Santa Cruz, afirmou que, com sua [fala, Eduardo Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/10/eduardo-bolsonaro-diz-que-se-esquerda-radicalizar-resposta-pode-ser-um-novo-ai-5.shtml) deixou claro que o governo Jair Bolsonaro “quer seguir o caminho do fascismo”. ""Pela primeira vez eles deixam claro o querem: o caminho do fascismo.""

 A família Bolsonaro tem um [histórico de exaltação ao período da ditadura militar ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/veja-10-frases-polemicas-de-bolsonaro-sobre-o-golpe-de-1964-e-a-ditadura-militar.shtml)no país. 

 Líder do PSL na Câmara, Eduardo Bolsonaro já havia defendido o uso da repressão policial caso o Brasil registre protestos como os que ocorrem no Chile por melhorias sociais e contra o alto custo de vida no país.

 Em discurso no plenário da Casa na terça (29), o filho do presidente da República acusou a esquerda de não ser democrática e de querer um terceiro turno das eleições. “Eles vão querer repetir no Brasil o que está acontecendo no Chile. O Chile é a referência da América Latina com relação à economia. A maior renda per capita da América Latina, a referência em Previdência”, afirmou.

 O Ato Institucional nº 5, marco do período mais duro da ditadura militar brasileira, foi editado em 13 de dezembro de 1968, no governo do marechal Costa e Silva, e deixou um saldo de cassações, direitos políticos suspensos, demissões e aposentadorias compulsórias.

 O mais radical decreto do regime também abriu caminho para o recrudescimento da repressão, com mortes e desaparecimentos de militantes da esquerda armada.

 Filho do presidente Jair Bolsonaro e líder do PSL na Câmara, o deputado federal deu a declaração em entrevista à jornalista Leda Nagle realizada na segunda-feira (28) e publicada nesta quinta-feira (31) no canal dela no YouTube.

 ""Se a esquerda radicalizar a esse ponto, a gente vai precisar ter uma resposta.

Alguma resposta vai ter que ser dada"", afirmou o parlamentar, filho do presidente Jair Bolsonaro.

  Mais tarde, em meio à repercussão de sua declaração, Eduardo usou uma rede social para reforçar a exaltação à ditadura militar.

 ""‪Se você está do lado da verdade, NÃO TENHAIS MEDO!‬"", escreveu, ao postar um vídeo no qual o pai, ainda deputado federal, enaltece o [coronel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml), um dos principais símbolos da repressão durante a ditadura e condenado em segunda instância por tortura e sequestro no regime militar.

 O [quinto ato, assinado pelo marechal Arthur da Costa e Silva](http://temas.folha.uol.com.br/50-anos-ai5/) (que assumira a Presidência em 1967), resultou no fechamento imediato e por tempo indeterminado do Congresso Nacional e das Assembleias nos estados —com exceção de São Paulo.

 Além disso, o [AI-5](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/entenda-o-golpe-de-1964-e-as-consequencias-da-ditadura-militar-no-pais.shtml) renovou poderes conferidos ao presidente para cassar mandatos e suspender direitos políticos, agora em caráter permanente. Também foi suspensa a garantia do habeas corpus em casos de crimes políticos, contra a segurança nacional, a ordem econômica e a economia popular.

 Nesta quinta-feira, uma das primeiras reações veio do presidente nacional do PSDB, Bruno Araújo, que disse em uma rede social que ""parece que não restam mais dúvidas sobre as intenções autoritárias de quem não suporta viver em uma sociedade livre"".

 ""Preferem a coerção ao livre debate de ideias. Escolhem a intolerância ao diálogo. Ameaçar a democracia é jogar o Brasil novamente nas trevas. O PSDB nasceu na luta pela volta da democracia no Brasil condena de maneira veemente as declarações do filho do presidente da República"", disse Araújo.

 Líder do PSDB na Câmara, Carlos Sampaio (SP) chamou a declaração de ""desatino"". “É um comentário que afronta a democracia, agride o bom senso e que não ajuda em nada o país neste momento em que estabilidade política é essencial para avançarmos nas discussões que são importantes para o país.”

 A deputada Joice Hasselmann (PSL-SP) afirmou que a democracia vive um ""grave risco"". ""Agora fica claro que isso é tudo que essa gente sempre quis"", disse. 

 ""Começou com a radicalização do discurso, com o ataque desenfreado a qualquer um que guarde os princípios democráticos e defenda as liberdades, seguiu para interferência em outros Poderes e com a construção da narrativa de que é preciso fazer qualquer coisa para o inimigo não tomar o poder, até mesmo um golpe"", afirmou a parlamentar do partido de Bolsonaro, mas rompida com a ala ligada ao presidente. 

 Marcos Pereira, presidente do Republicanos, divulgou nota em que diz ""repudiar veementemente"" a declaração de Eduardo e pediu ""bom senso, equilíbrio, moderação e diálogo"".

 ""Ressalta-se, ainda, que atentar contra a democracia é crime, como prescreve o artigo 5º da Constituição Federal"", afirmou. ""Não podemos aceitar, sob nenhuma justificativa, qualquer incitação a atitudes autoritárias. (...) Infelizmente não é a primeira vez que Eduardo Bolsonaro, o deputado mais votado da nossa democracia, dá indícios de que flerta com o autoritarismo"", disse.

  Líder do Podemos na Câmara, o deputado José Nelto qualificou a declaração de infeliz e de retrocesso. “O Parlamento não concorda e não leva a sério uma declaração dessa. É um ato isolado e que vai criar um isolamento dele como líder no Congresso”, afirmou.

 Para Nelto, a declaração, além de desastrosa, fere a democracia. “Nós estamos vivendo um momento de autoritarismo não só no Brasil, a democracia está sendo atingida no fígado. É hora de reagir”, defendeu.

 Já o líder do bloco que reúne MDB, PP e Republicanos, o senador Esperidião Amin (PP-SC) disse que a manifestação é ""absolutamente desconectada de fatos e realidades"". ""De forma que acho que ela [a manifestação] é irrelevante pelo conteúdo e por quem explicita o conteúdo"", afirmou o senador.

 O líder do PSD no Senado, Otto Alencar (BA), disse que Eduardo não deve saber o que é o AI-5 e que não o leva a sério. ""Ele diz tanta coisa sem conexão com o regime democrático... Será que ele tem respaldo das Forças Armadas?"", indagou o senador. ""Estamos vivendo um momento em que todas as crises destes últimos dez meses foram gestadas ou pelo presidente ou pelos filhos dele"", afirmou.

 A oposição também criticou as declarações. Líder da minoria na Câmara, a deputada Jandira Feghali (PC do B-RJ) questionou: ""É o Brasil com AI-5 em pleno 2019 que Bolsonaro​ quer vender para o mundo e investidores? Um país com censura prévia, perseguição às liberdades individuais e mortes pelo Estado? É irresponsável, leviano! Essa família no poder é um erro grave na história do país.""

 A presidente nacional do PT, deputada Gleisi Hoffmann (PR), defendeu que o Ministério Público e o STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) tomem providências contra as declarações. ""A população precisa saber o que vocês estão fazendo"", disse.",1
5,2019-10-31 16:38:13+00:00,"I was also going on I say the death of my parents. Both had cancer. One did not want me to be there, she was comfortable, but angry and depressed about her cheated time right till the end.  We couldn’t even get her to talk to us, she was so mad at the world.   In a way I always felt cheated that we never even had a chance to come to terms with what was happening. 

The other refused to have anyone take care of him except for me. He was not comfortable. He was in extreme pain, as cancer slowly took his stomach lining over.  I’ve never seen a person be so tortured for so long in my life - it was worse than any movie scene because a movie scene only lasts a few minutes. This took months.  He lived in an area where there was no palliative care, and the county hospitals were too understaffed. So it was just me and him at home, for weeks and weeks, on an isolated farm with no visitors and harsh winter settling in.  I did everything - cleaned his accidents, emptied his drain that was attached to his midsection, that took out fluids from his stomach cavity - which was not just fluid but lots of white globs (this is actually cancerous tissue broken away).  He was so vulnerable and embarrassed and in severe pain that nothing helped (we had fetanyl, but it made him feel sick)

The entire ordeal was so harsh that I couldn’t even mourn the loss for a while - first I had to deal with the estate and funeral, then I had to physically recover myself,  make up loss time at work, and after that came PTSD of being out there so remote on those cold winter night not being able to soothe or do anything for a person who I loved very very much.  Then I could finally grieve the loss of a very great and strong man. 

I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.",1

Twelve years later, it's 4-5 30mg pills a day, I've ""lost"" my 20's (as in ""my youth""), god knows how much money, and (probably) a lot of respect.  

Finally threw them away when a friend *finally* got me to look closely at what I was doing (wasn't the first friend who tried, just the first friend who ""broke through"")...but not a week goes by that I don't think about them, and at some level, want them badly again...that's just my life now, and I know I'll always have to be on guard.",1

Of course thats not normal but just because nobody does it and everyone is saying its bad, doesnt mean its really bad. 

As you mentioned, he is pretty sucessful in life and gets stuff done that has to be done, now where is the problem? What if he had a script for some oxycodon that should take every day? Many doctors do that.

That would be dangerous. He switches between them and wont get physicaly addicted, which is important. 

Other people smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a day and its completly normal. But im reality its much much MUCH more dangerous than taking a benzo, opioid or a stim here and there. 

I mean if he you wake up to him not responding because he took to much xanax, that would be a problem.

Wow you mad bro? You asked a question and got a direct answer. If you’re feeling attacked that’s on you. Seems pretty insecure though.

&gt; Is Oxy and Fentynyl considered recreational drugs in your neighborhood? wow. You really demonstrate a total lack of understanding on this issue.

I mean I guess. People use them recreationally so there’s that. I can’t really see how that demonstrates a lack of understanding since it’s objectively true.

&gt; Drug Vending machines seem silly? even to YOU? because you're the one calling for deregulation so why not let the free market make up it's own mind? why not let junkies and addicts have easy access to their ""medicine"" ? 

Yeah they kind of do. I don’t see liquor vending machines all over the place. I see no reason to implement a system of legal and controlled a ability like the one in place in Portugal as I mentioned earlier. Instead of locking people in cages like animals for wanting to get loaded we could easily provide access to clean, regulated drugs for those who want to use them. While eliminating the dangerous and violent black market and putting support programs in place for addicts who want to stop using. All for a fraction of the cost we spend on incarcerations now.

&gt; it's not a straw man, it just shows how bad your argument actually is.

It really is though. No reasonable person is suggesting a crack-o-vend outside of the CVS. Just you. 

&gt; Ohhh that explains it. you're still in College! 

Lol never went to college. Professional and small business owner. Nice try though

&gt;maybe when you put down the textbooks (the only place that Libertarianism actually exists) 

Not an argument. Also not factually correct either.


&gt;you'll realize that it's doomed to fail because people are greedy and fearful and violent by nature. 

I’m already well aware of this. The exact reason I’m a libertarian. Ironically also a great argument in favor of gun rights. Thanks lol

&gt;And those things come out in full force when there are no laws, nor system to enforce them. 

Again not advocating anarchy. 

&gt;Libertarianism degrades into Warlords ASAP.   

Citation needed.

&gt;It's principles don't apply evenly to every problem of society. 

Funny how pretty much everyone in western society unknowingly lives by the non aggression principle every day. Even you.

&gt;Also, what's more ""Libertarian"" than Gun Vending Machines?? Drug Vending Machines?

Not hurting people and not taking their stuff.

&gt; that is the nature of almost all human organizations. Give a Private corporation enough time and it will bloat into an inefficient sloth.

True. The difference is that in a privatized market model there’s competition to offset inefficiency. With government there’s an absolute monopoly on whatever it gets its hooks in and there’s no accountability for inefficient waste, fraud and abuse. You don’t even get a say in how the money they take from you is spent. Wars of aggression? Yeah we’re doing that. Locking people in cages for smoking a plant? Lol yup. Don’t like us giving ourselves raises every year regardless of the quality of work we’re doing? Tough cookies pal pay up.

&gt; Private prisons are a good idea?

Depends. In their current form definitely not. But if the funding were to be shifted from paying per head housed and instead paying more for lower levels of repeat offenders the big wigs get fatter bonuses for incentivizing actual rehabilitation and support systems rather than getting paid to stack people on top of one another.

&gt; Here ya go. Demonstrating that you don't know more about government. 

Oh do tell lol.

&gt;At least about taxation. Which is not theft. 

Yes it is.

&gt;since property rights are determined by the state

They aren’t. That’s why we call them property RIGHTS, not property privileges. Also just because those rights are routinely violated doesn’t make them any less a right. 

&gt;taxation by the state cannot be considered theft. 

Not sure what else you’d call forcibly taking something from someone else under the threat of violence. Extortion maybe? Sure taxes are extortion. You got me there.

&gt;Taxation does not take from people what they already own. 

That’s quite literally exactly what it does.

&gt;Your Pre-Tax wealth is not all yours either. Once you accept a job under this system you've agreed to the system that democratically allowed people to accumulate wealth only with the understanding that a portion of that wealth would be allocated for public use.

Boy that’s some serious mental gymnastics there! So since I own my own business I shouldn’t be taxed then? Because I’d really appreciate it if you would let the irs know so they don’t come to collect. Sure would make my life a helluva lot easier.

&gt; If Tax Cuts encourage job creation, then we would have lost jobs under Clinton when Clinton raised taxes. FACT: More jobs were created under Clinton than under any other President.

I’m not sure how this is even remotely relevant. Clinton has some serious problems that happened on his watch but going into those would be getting way off topic so I’ll just leave it. Same with Bush. I don’t care for what either of them did and it doesn’t have any bearing on this discussion.

&gt; oh you mean how we get to watch the meltdown of society through that little rectangle we stare at all day as they track us like dogs?

Yeah I guess that’s one way of looking at it. Yet here you are. Let’s just ignore the fact that’s it’s probably the most powerful and influential technological innovation humanity has created to date because private interests were expressly responsible for what its development into what it is today. I for one like having all of the information, EVER in my pocket.

&gt; This is STILL about 80% of what the internet is, also including medical data between hospitals etc.  The surfing the web part of the internet makes up a very small tip of the iceberg.

Maybe. Number one is email. Second is research third is downloads. Four is discussion groups, I guess reddit probably counts and five is online gaming. Still doesn’t take away from my original point though. 

&gt; Republicans who allowed a private entity to meddle in the public task of cleaning water. FAIL bro.

I’m a libertarian “bro”. Not sure why you think republicans having anything to do with it is like a sick burn or something. I dislike both parties equally. Moreover the federal EPA knew what was going on and drug their feet for like six months behind that. 

&gt; not at all. i never said size of government = best society.

But you did insinuate it by declaring that the government is the end all be all of clean air and water and then invoking China. 

&gt; As I said, humanity has tried many different forms of governing each other. Not all of them worked. Our current system isn't perfect, but it's surely the best we've ever come up with.

Yet you fail to address my point entirely. Since governments sanctioned slavery in the past and you assert that they did so to provide for the best delivery of the wants and needs for the most people does that somehow absolve them of such a practice? Because the line of logic you’re running with suggests that regardless of the practice of the government sanctions it then it’s a-ok.

&gt; Oh dear boy. Please tell that to those in Hong Kong.

You mean the same Hong Kong whose citizens are saying they wish they had arms available? The same ones who are defending themselves against tyranny against a violent authoritarian regime with rocks and bottles because that’s all they have at hand? They’re absolutely exercising their right to self defense and it’s a real shame they don’t have better tools to do so at hand.

&gt;Hong Kong calling.....

Exactly my point. Their rights are absolutely being violated.

&gt; So you want government to help you protect your rights, but you don't want government in your life either. make up your mind.

It’s one of the only things that our government does right here. The bill of rights is legal protection of those rights against the government. It’s pretty awesome. Don’t need to make up my mind because the way things were originally set up I shouldn’t have to.

&gt; an easy example of why this system fails.  there are only so many fish in a location... 

Tragedy of the commons. Easily solved by property rights. This is old hat and has been answered ad nauseam.

&gt;Another example  of this is pollution.

Glad you mention this actually because it’s one of the few examples where the market doesn’t address a need and I actually advocate for some basic government controls. There’s a private property argument to be made there as well but I personally haven’t heard a practical solution for something like air or groundwater pollution. Thus, minarchy not anarchy.

&gt;The third party effects arising from production of this good are greater than that of the private benefits incurred. Your system doesn't solve this.

Sure it does. Addressed in my last. Like I said, minarchy.

&gt; Ask Waco Texas if owning guns helped them fight against the Government.

So you’re going to use the government slaughter of some folks in Texas as an example of why it’s not a straw man? Ok I’ll bite. I’d rather ask they Bundy’s though. Direct from the source:
-Assistant Sheriff Lombardo recounted that ""they were in my face yelling profanities and pointing weapons,"" and said, ""We were outgunned, outmanned, and there would not have been a good result from it.""
Moreover it’s probably prudent to ask a few farmers in Afghanistan who have been fighting off the full on military force of the US military for like twenty years why they’re not dead yet.",1

It is said that the state of things was different in Egypt (Kalisch); but we have scarcely sufficient evidence on the point to be certain that the slave enjoyed there any real and efficient protection. At Athens, beyond a doubt, the law protected the life of the slave; and a very moderate amount of ill-treatment entitled a slave to bring an action. At Rome, on the contrary, ""the master could treat the slave as he pleased, could sell him, punish him, and put him to death"" (Dict. of Greek &amp; Roman Antiq. p. 1036). And this was the ordinary state of the law, particularly in Oriental countries. **The Mosaic legislation must be regarded as having greatly ameliorated the condition of the native slave population.** Hebrew bondmen it placed nearly upon a par with hired servants (Leviticus 25:40); foreign slaves, whether prisoners taken in war, or persons bought in the market, it protected to a very great extent. By the law given in verses 26, 27, it largely controlled the brutality of masters, who had to emancipate their slaves if they did them any serious injury. **By the law laid down in verse 20, it gave their lives the same protection, or nearly the same, as the lives of freemen.** ""Smiting ""was allowed as a discipline, without which slavery cannot exist; but such smiting as resulted in death was, as a general rule, punishable like any other homicide. The only exception was, if the slave did not die for some days (ver. 21). In that case the master was considered not to have intended the slave' s death, and to be sufficiently punished by the loss of his property. https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm",1

&gt;recreational drug

Is Oxy and Fentynyl considered recreational drugs in your neighborhood? wow. You really demonstrate a total lack of understanding on this issue. 

Drug Vending machines seem silly? even to YOU? because you're the one calling for deregulation so why not let the free market make up it's own mind? why not let junkies and addicts have easy access to their ""medicine"" ?  it's not a straw man, it just shows how bad your argument actually is. 

&gt;I’m a libertarian.

Ohhh that explains it. you're still in College! maybe when you put down the textbooks (the only place that Libertarianism actually exists) and enter the real world, you'll realize that it's doomed to fail because people are greedy and fearful and violent by nature. And those things come out in full force when there are no laws, nor system to enforce them. Libertarianism degrades into Warlords ASAP.   It's principles don't apply evenly to every problem of society. Although your professor may try to make you believe that it does. Also, what's more ""Libertarian"" than Gun Vending Machines?? Drug Vending Machines?

&gt;I just recognize that government, particularly in the form it is in now is grossly inefficient at performing most of its functions,

that is the nature of almost all human organizations. Give a Private corporation enough time and it will bloat into an inefficient sloth. 

Private prisons are a good idea?

&gt;taxat-theft

Here ya go. Demonstrating that you don't know more about government. At least about taxation. Which is not theft. since property rights are determined by the state, taxation by the state cannot be considered theft. Taxation does not take from people what they already own. Your Pre-Tax wealth is not all yours either. Once you accept a job under this system you've agreed to the system that democratically allowed people to accumulate wealth only with the understanding that a portion of that wealth would be allocated for public use.

If Tax Cuts encourage job creation, then we would have lost jobs under Clinton when Clinton raised taxes.
FACT: More jobs were created under Clinton than under any other President in history.

If Tax Cuts encourage job creation, then we would have gained jobs under Bush when Bush lowered taxes.
FACT: Fewer jobs were created under Bush than under any other President in the last 50 years.

FACT: More private sector jobs were created in the last 12 months under Obama than during the 8 years of the Bush administration.

&gt;private development made it what it is today. 

oh you mean how we get to watch the meltdown of society through that little rectangle we stare at all day as they track us like dogs?

&gt; The original internet was basically just a private message board for academia and military.

This is STILL about 80% of what the internet is, also including medical data between hospitals etc.  The surfing the web part of the internet makes up a very small tip of the iceberg. 

&gt;By the way the government did a great job in Flint.

Republicans who allowed a **private** entity to meddle in the public task of cleaning water. FAIL bro. 

&gt;bigger government it would stand to reason that their air would be even cleaner by that logic though right?

not at all. i never said size of government = best society. 

&gt;So was slavery ok for most of human history 

As I said, humanity has tried many different forms of governing each other. Not all of them worked. Our current system isn't perfect, but it's surely the best we've ever come up with. 

&gt;Government doesn’t have anything to do with my right to own a gun or use one to protect myself.

Oh dear boy. Please tell that to those in Hong Kong. 

&gt;Rights can’t be taken away, only violated.

Hong Kong calling.....

&gt; The second amendment is an affirmation that the government has a responsibility to protect that right.

So you want government to help you protect your rights, but you don't want government in your life either. make up your mind. 

&gt;minarchy,

an easy example of why this system fails.  there are only so many fish in a location, and Alice can't stop Bob from fishing there, so Alice and Bob catch too many fish and next year there are practically no fish left. Alice and Bob could make some sort of agreement, but nothing prevents Charlie, Denise and Emily from still fishing. So everyone is poorer than had there been some sort of limit on over-fishing. Another example  of this is pollution. If a firm can lower their average costs in order to make significantly more profit by dumping their waste in the local river, so long as the owners don't drink from said river, it will probably do so to maximise it's profit margins probably. This generally harms the local population far more than the company gains from not properly disposing its waste, so overall it's a net loss for society. The third party effects arising from production of this good are greater than that of the private benefits incurred. Your system doesn't solve this. 

&gt;More straw men.

18,2019-10-30 21:13:31+00:00,"&gt; what does potable water have to do with a Federal judge ruling on bump stocks?!?!

The comment thread you’re in is in direct response to another user who made this comment.

“Some of us maybe, but the odds are that you're probably just another keyboard cowboy who would end up shitting himself to death from drinking tainted water less two than weeks into an actual absence of municipal authority.”

&gt; Second, are you saying that we should decriminalize ALL drugs? sounds like a very stupid plan given the Oxy-Fentynyl overdose epidemic we already have in this country and those drugs are regulated.  But your idea is to have them sold in vending machines now? thank god you're not running for office.

Yes. Prohibition isn’t working and it never has worked. All it has accomplished is driving the entire recreational drug trade underground, creating the dangerous environment, gang culture and criminal gun violence problems you mentioned earlier. The oxy/fent problem you mentioned is direct evidence of this as it’s primarily an issue of recreational users and addicts being unable to obtain their chemicals legally, instead being forced to the black market where there is zero quality control in place. If you want a great example of this working in practice take a look at the results Portugal has had.

The vending machine comment is a straw man and a poor attempt at that, not even worth addressing. And yes, thank god I’m not running for office. I wouldn’t want to subject myself or my family to that kind of life.

&gt; and now you've said it. The fundamental difference between right and left. 

I’m not on the right. I’m a libertarian. Right wingers tend to hate me because I support lgbtq rights, legalized pot and separation of church and state, particularly when it comes to schools.

&gt;There is never, ever going to be a government entitiy that you would deem helpful or at least positive. 

That’s an inaccurate assumption. I think there’s a few items that markets don’t properly account for, primarily basic environmental protections and some consumer protection stuff. I just recognize that government, particularly in the form it is in now is grossly inefficient at performing most of its functions, and a vast majority of those functions don’t even fit into its own scope as outlined in the constitution. 

&gt;But this is because you don't actually understand government

I think I understand government better than you do friend. Government isn’t some benevolent entity looking out for the good of the people it governs, it a massive, self serving machine that grinds on using the people it’s supposed to be serving as fuel by way of taxat, er theft.

&gt;you just feel like it's all bad. 

It pretty much is.

&gt;When in fact the government gave us the internet

Which was a joke until it was opened up and private development made it what it is today. The original internet was basically just a private message board for academia and military. Because of private development we have access to basically all of the information ever recorded, entirely new forms of media in the way of live streaming, VODs and podcasts to name a few and entirely new industry based strictly around online content.

&gt;it controls our air traffic and makes sure we have clean water and air 

I don’t drink tap. By the way the government did a great job in Flint. 

&gt;(have you been to china?)

No. Seems like since they have an even bigger government it would stand to reason that their air would be even cleaner by that logic though right?


&gt; Government is a system that humans have created and tried through numerous different iterations. It's formed through natural needs and wants that favor the most people the best ways.

So was slavery ok for most of human history since during that period it was government sanctioned? Doesn’t seem like it favored them all that well.

&gt; oh and by the way, it's that very government that allows you to own firearms and openlyprotest it in the first place.

Government doesn’t have anything to do with my right to own a gun or use one to protect myself. That’s why it’s called a RIGHT. Rights can’t be taken away, only violated. The second amendment is an affirmation that the government has a responsibility to protect that right. That’s all.

&gt; You want anarchy, and that's never worked.

Incorrect. I’m an advocate for minarchy, which is very different. But where we stop the bus isn’t really relevant right now since it’s been traveling the wrong way my entire life. For sure we need to stop and turn around. Where we end up can be discussed later and should probably be in varying degrees for varying communities and cultures.

22,2019-10-30 20:08:30+00:00,"Addiction is a sickness. The simple cases to look at are like heavy opioid dependency (which is a huge issue in the states right now, See fentanyl). Opioids are considered one of the most addictive drugs available, and our pharmacy's hand them out like candy. Many MANY people have gone into the hospital clean as a whistle and come out with a prescription and a newly formed ""Habit"". I put habit in quotations with good reason. A habit is something self formed, however when you are in the hospital you dont always have the choice to say no, or you are in so much pain that you wouldnt say no to some sort of relief.   


Now you have your first prescription for pain pills. Something that most KNOW is an opioid, and assume it is safe because it has been prescribed. These things creep up on you. Your in pain, a lot of pain, so you take 1.5 your prescribed dose. The next day you try the same thing with less effect so you pop an extra 1.5 the dose. Pretty soon your prescription is dry, and your pharmacy wont renew.   


Now not only are you still in pain, but you are craving the relief. You start to complain to your friends about the pain and how your pharmacy wont re up your prescription until next week. Someone says they know a guy, that guy sets you up with some pain ""meds"". You know this is now a street drug, what you dont probably know is that it is likely laced with fetanyl. The new drug you are on is incredible knocks out your pain like nothing else, and you get your fix like nothing youve had before. Soon your able to re up your prescription. Now you have a bottle of pain pills which wont do much for you because youve now been taking fetanyl laced street drugs. It is at this point that you are probably realizing that you have a problem if you realize at all. Often times you dont have a chance to realize because fetanyl is likely to kill you.   


Say you did realize that you had a problem. Say you try to quit cold turkey....well that can kill you too. Your body has now built a HUGE dependency on the drug. Before it kills you, you will have withdrawals, withdrawals so bad that you wish you were dead (and likely soon you will be without some drugs). Your body temperature cant regulate itself, and you are sweating yourself dry while simultaneously freezing to death. You realize that you still have some of your fix left, and you grab it and without thinking take the entirety of your supply.   


Any way you look at it you are headed 6 feet deep while your family is wondering what happened in the last 2 months.   


You think that you are being safe with it, and before you know it you are dependent. Not just WANTING it, but YOUR BODY ACTUALLY NEEDS IT TO FUNCTION.   


After righting this out, i have no envy of people working in a methadone clinic.  


I should have prefaced this with a statement. I personally have never suffered an addiction like that described, nor do i think i would ever let myself do that. But i am fully aware of what these drugs are capable of, and i am aware that in short order I could easily become addicted. I could get in a car accident on my way home tonight, and wake up 3 days from now already well on my way to addiction.   


The fact is unless you have been near someone who is addicted, or you yourself have tried to break an addiction you have no clue how it feels. You have no frame of reference for it, and to be blunt, you really should not be commenting on it.   


Because seeing it from the outside, or through a movie, or hearing it from me here on the interwebs does no justice to the depth's of hell you can reach through addiction.   


If you want a movie to watch that can give you some feeling of how it is to be addicted without actually getting hooked for yourself go check out ""Requiem for a Dream"". It is an amazing movie, but will drop you into depression before it is through.",1

31,2019-10-30 01:08:50+00:00,"If we're talking about people who have actually been diagnosed with a mental illness and are receiving/have received professional help from a medical practitioner then it's a tad different.

The fact is, something like clinical depression and extreme anxiety are totally crippling. Not even just mentally. Your body quite literally (not figuratively) feels heavy, worn out, tired, lethargic - even in actual pain just because you suffer from depression and or anxiety.

Let's also consider the fact that these ailments affect how the brain works. Serotonin levels. Dopamine, oxycotin. Your body is not great at producing these things on its own and needs a bit of a kick.

So you taje medication. Get those levels up. But then, you have a new normal. And it's only normal because of the drugs. And there's usually side effects and other issues to be discovered along the way. But at least things feel *different* for now.

After a while certain people might not like this new, new. The lines too soft. Too vague. Horribly in the middle of everything. No extreme highs but no extreme lows. Reduced sex drive. Putting on weight or losing weight. (Which can lead to waaaaaaay more problems to try and overcome). A loss in connection with family or friends. Potential to view your job differently. And many more, but perhaps most importantly, you're left with the realisation that you are dependent on this drug to feel this level of 'non-awful' and without it things would be the same as before.

I'm sorry but those things are not easily dealt with by someone who is able to rationalise them let along someone who maybe isn't as educated on the subject and is terrified of such an extreme change in their life. Even someone well-read who can rationalise and understand - they are not well-positioned to deal with such an overall ordeal because they are **suffering.**

It seems there is still a long way to go before we rid the stigma attached to mental health issues. Comments like this don't help. Sure, some people self-diagnose and use this as a way to escape the judgment of being an apathetic teen with a tortured outlook on life. Adolescents are not adults because their brains are still developing. As are their bodies. If you're referring to these people, your post should be more specific and mention this.

To end this little story let's focus on those who have tried *every single kind of anti-depressant on the market* (and no they don't work like you see on TV where you pop a pill and instantly feel better. Even ecstacy takes a ***little bit of time*** to get going). But then, they struggle to come off the drug after becoming dependent and are returned back to how they felt before but actually worse off because they thought this pill was going to save them and cure them and can make them feel brand new. What then?

Would you say the same to those people who have actively tried to get better and put themselves through that ultimately **life-changing** experience (because that's most certainly what it was) but yet are left feeling even more hopeless and with less opportunities to get better?

It's true some people are able to function even when dealing with extreme stress, depression, anxiety and whatever other issues you can think of but everyone has a breaking point and a lot of the time what you see is very different to the truth.

Nobody has the right to call out vast swathes of other people just because they handle similar situations differently to them. And after all, you don't know that person's life, what they've been through and just how bad their condition is.

OPs kind of thinking is from a bygone era that has no place in a progressive society where we look to try and better understand and help those of us who are burning out and struggling to cope with societal expectations and financial and relationship commitments on a huge spectrum of variation.

When you run yourself a bath and then realise that was 5 hours ago and you haven't even washed your hair, that's when you get a slight nudge from a huge unsightly beast with no face that calmly whispers into your ear ""it's okay. I'm here now."" That's when you realise you're not alone but for the wrong reasons and that you have a problem to deal with.

Anxiety isn't watching a scary video on YouTube. It's not what any of those tweets say it is. It's different for all of us but the one constant is that it's silent, it's predatory, it's violent and wholly indiscriminate in who and how it targets.

Sorry for the rant and whoever made it this far I both congratulate and thank you and I can only hope I've helped explain something other people have already done but with my own input from my own experiences. Mental health is not something you just get up and do. Even a car needs a trained hand to fix otherwise after a while the wheels end up falling off and you kill yourself and/or other people.",1

Ma gerente non è un ticinesismo, lo danno i dizionari: ""s. m. e f. chi è incaricato della gestione di un'attività, di un esercizio, di un'azienda | gerente di un giornale, (antiq.) direttore responsabile"" (Garzanti online); ""chi gestisce per conto d’altri un’attività, un esercizio, un’azienda; gestore"" (De Mauro online). Nel settore gastronomico ticinese gestore e gerente sono giuridicamente due funzioni diverse, così definite dal Regolamento della legge sugli esercizi pubblici: Art. 75 1. Il gestore è l'imprenditore (persona fisica, morale o unione di persone) responsabile della conduzione dell'esercizio. 2. È possibile essere gestore di più esercizi. Art. 80 Il gerente è la persona fisica responsabile verso l'Ufficio e il gestore del rispetto della legge e del regolamento. Art. 81 Il gerente assicura, con la sua presenza, il buon funzionamento dell'esercizio sotto tutti i punti di vista (curando in particolare l'istruzione del personale, i rapporti con la clientela, l'ordine, la quiete, l'igiene, la pulizia, ecc.). Gerente di un comune: persona incaricata dal governo cantonale di amministrare un comune quando questo non è più giudicato in grado di farlo da solo; provvedimento di eccezione, art. 201 ""gestione speciale"" della Legge organica comunale:1Quando un comune si trova nell’impossibilità di costituire i propri organi o in difficoltà ad assicurare la normale amministrazione o quando il municipio si sottrae in modo deliberato e continuo ai doveri del suo ufficio, l’autorità di vigilanza può, previa diffida, direttamente o per mezzo di uno o più delegati affiancarsi o sostituirsi al municipio nell’amministrazione del comune, fintanto che perdurano i motivi che hanno giustificato l’intervento.2L’assemblea comunale o il consiglio comunale mantengono tuttavia le proprie prerogative. In questo caso si dice che il comune è in gerenza.

In of itself fentanyl is pretty safe and its one of the weaker pain relief options out there. Fentanyl alone only lasts about 20-30 minutes. Also absorbing it through the skin is a lot more difficult than the more recent fentanyl scares would have you believe.,1

Churchill (matou 40 milhões de bengaleses de fome e instalou governo simpatizante de nazistas na Grécia)? Lincoln (usou de poderes ditatoriais, perseguiu desafetos políticos e ordenou a pilhagem e destruição de cidades inimigas)? Alexandre o Grande? Pelo jeito vc só assistira um filme estrelado pela Madre Teresa? Que tal o Gregório Bezerra ao invés do Marighella aqui? 

Depende tremendamente do tom que eles dão pro filme,eu vi a queda é um bom filme e não fica glorificiando o hitler, dunquerque também vi é um filme que foca em um evento, faz parecer que o Churchill é um heroi sim, mas é marginal. No mais ainda todas essas figuras tiveram um papel histórico tremendo - pro bem e pro mal que fizeram - mariguella é só uma figura de valor histórico quase nulo, o filme é mais propaganda ideólogica, tanto é que o fizeram completamente negro pra se encaixar nas narrativas de quem o defende, mas é um detalhe e picuinha. 

Se o filme for só glorificação de figura - Lincoln, Churchill, Mandella ou tantos outros-  então é provavelmente uma perca de tempo.Eu sei que sua intenção não foi essa, mas acho Madre Teresa uma figura repugnante, Christopher hitchens fez uma críticas pesadíssimas dela. Não é bom tornar políticos hérois.",1

É completamente irrelevante isso aqui, eu poderia contestar algumas coisas aqui, mas não importa.

&gt; Vc tá certo, ele não lutava pela ""democracia"" burguesa (autocracia). Mas pela ditadura do proletariado e a verdadeira representação dos interesses da classe trabalhadora.

&gt; Carlos Marighella foi um herói nacional. Um mulato baiano que foi toruturado por Vargas, Magalhães e os milicos... E seguiu lutando pela liberdade e emancipação de toda a humanidade. 

Carlos Marighella foi um terrorista que chefiou uma organização assassina as fontes tão todos no link que eu mandei, isso é tudo que importa, o resto da obra dele deixa de importar no momento que ele sai matando gente inocente. Se você passa pano chamando de heroi um assassino porque ele defendia um regime do qual você é adepto, então é bom não reclamar do presidente elogiando o Ustra, simples asssim.

62,2019-10-26 21:45:21+00:00,"See if the docs will let you bring in a tablet or some other distraction and check your BP over the course of an hour or so after you get relaxed. Its really supposed to be about resting BP so looking around the parking lot for a space then directly taking your BP is going to make it test high. You gotta chill for a little, then have them check it. Its still probably going to require medicating, but a stroke or heart attack is probably not likely.  

I used to totally ignore my BP, then one day I sat at one of those machines at the pharmacy and got readings very close to your 1st ones, up in the hypertensive emergency range. I was freaked out to say the least. I always tried to watch the salt intake and the artery cloggers like eggs. Turns out eggs arent that bad and helped me drop a few pounds. But I digress. Went to the doc and he didnt want to believe the 1st reading, and I didn't ask but I imagine it was in the 200/130 range. He was pretty concerned looking. We shot the bull and traded jokes for a couple minutes and it was down around 170/100. Still high but 30 points is nothing to sneeze at. It was the difference between going to the ER or leaving with some drug samples. I guess that was about a year ago. Believe it or not, I had to fight with the insurance a couple times to get the damn BP drugs, so I wasnt medicated steadily but the effects were pretty good. I'll still bust 140/100 once in a while, but when I have my meds steady, 110/80 is pretty normal these days. And I dropped about 40 pounds just by pushing the plate away before I was full most of the time and having the leftovers for lunch. Still drinking full strength coke by the two litre bottle and eating full fat ice cream, all the diet stuff they said not to do, and my sugar came down, of all things. My doc was stunned when I told him about the diet stuff. But its very rare these days to have chest pain (that's what made me sit at the machine in the drug store in the 1st place)and its usually a reminder that I forgot to take my BP meds. Since operating your body with a high BP for too long can damage blood vessels, I have a feeling I did some permanent damage to my eyesight, but who knows how long I was working at high pressures or how high they really got, so if having to wear reading glasses is the worst I have done, I'll take it. EKG on the yearly physical was good. So dont ignore your BP.

Yeah, opioids can mess with your heart, particularly the qt timing of the beat, causing a ""misfire"". Do not make the mistake of believing that just because they call these drugs ""pain killers"" that you will get rid of all pain. You should be able to ignore your remaining pain most of the time, but these drugs cant do miracles. I said to someone the other day ""function restorer"" would be more accurate. You are just able to function more even if you have to tolerate a bit of pain. You could be medicated enough to be semi conscious, in which case they may deserve the title pain killer, but that's not any quality of life for a human being.

There are so many opioid options that could take the place of butrans its impossible to know what any given doctors preference might be. It's a safe bet it wont be methadone since that's ever worse for your heart. Plain old morphine might be a decent pick. The best route would be to try the options one at a time and see, hydrocodone, oxycodone, the morphones and so on. If the tramadol didnt give your heart a gallop, it may be worth suggesting it. Buprenorphine is an opioid, regardless of how a doc might try to sell it to a patient. Its quickly becoming a popular drug of abuse too as more people are exposed to it. There's about a half a dozen different NON opioid FAMILIES of drugs they might dip in to as alternatives as well. Anti depressant, anti convulsants, GABA drugs and a lot more. Just remember that you are part of your pain team, the most important part, and you have a say in the treatment you receive. If your doc makes a decision, you have an obligation to ask about advantages, disadvantages, how they came to that decision, etc, etc. No such thing as a dumb question, there are only dumb answers. Good luck.",1

So from personal experience you aren't going to hurt yourself. With Hydro or Oxycodone they almost always lower the amount of APAP in the pill to be proportionally the same to the amount of Oxy. So a single 10mg Perocet has 650mg of Tylenol in it right? A 5mg percocet almost always has 325mg of APAP. It stays the same anyway. If you want to mix opiates and alcohol in larger quantities in the future I recommend doing a cold water extraction to get all that nasty APAP out. Promise me you will look that up when we are done talking okay?

Anyway I don't judge. I won't try to scare you away from the opiate world... But be super careful with getting into the opiate games too.

People say smoking is impossible to quit, but opiates made me cold Turkey a 10+ year pack a day habit with the snap of the fingers just so I could afford more painkillers.

91,2019-10-24 05:02:03+00:00,"Sure you can. I recently broke a rib and an elbow. They gace me 12 5mg norco for the pain, because, you know, the opioid epidemic that's causing people to turn to heroin.

So I talked to a guy I know and bought a handful of 5mg oxcodone to get me through once those were gone. You can get things without doctors. You just need to know who to talk to.",1
92,2019-10-24 02:51:30+00:00,"Well, I am high as balls but that doesn't negate my point.

Perhaps my original unstated premise is that when drugs aren't a MASSIVE profit center there's no reason to push people for addiction.

You don't have to take my word for it... look at Purdue Pharma and other Oxycotin makers deliberately trying to get people hooked on the drug (illegally) because it was a massive profit center.

For addictive drugs it just makes sense to completely gut the market and make it accessible to anyone that wants them... this way you can also HELP them with addiction since now they're not worried about going to prison.",1
93,2019-10-23 23:30:35+00:00,"My parents were drug addicts. My sister is a drug addict.  I too am an addict, but not currently using. Maybe deliberately for the first time in my life. By the time I was 17 I was functionally living in a drug den- my parents were selling Oxycotin right out of the house. Their lives revolved selling and using. After a year of this my mother died of an overdose and father began opening shooting heroine before he abruptly just left. By this point I was using too. Since then I have been addicting to everything and kicked it all twice over, except opiates. I think there is something wrong with me- I feel psychologically broken. I pulled my dead mother from a bathtub. I cared for my grandmother for many years while she had Alzheimer''s disease until her passing. My wife left me to fuck her cocaine dealer. So what is left after all of that? The only thing that is left is heroine.  I was clean for seven months before I relapsed three weeks ago. It was great, it felt fucking awesome- for the first time in a long time I felt like I wasn't completely broken inside. But I won't use again, that feeling slowly destroys everything else in my life. What little is left.",1

97,2019-10-23 15:14:42+00:00,"Yours and everyone's story moved me a lot and I wanted to share my story as well. I too don't have a lot of friends that I can get stoned with.  Though my husband wants to (and will in legal rec states) he won't until it become rec in AZ because he fears for his job and us needing the insurance, well, yeah I get it, but it makes it kinda lonely.

Funny thing is, we have about the same timeline as well.  I had tried it when I was a teen and never really cared for the experience, it just made me super sleepy. I knew that weed was good for nausea, but always scoffed at those who claimed it more like a miracle drug. I just thought that these people had been taking too much of their product, it couldn't be what they said. Boy was I ever wrong.

I have a whole list of AI issues (Crohn's, Arthritis, Diabetes, AI liver disease, and many more) and was on fentnyl patches for almost 10 years. (also housebound during that time too). I can't take most OTC meds for even mild pain due to crohn's (NSAIDS are a HUGE no-no for me) and my liver (tylenol can't be used), so I was stuck with opiates. I didn't even consider weed, but my docs were happy to prescribe the opiates. I hated the side effects, the physical dependency, the sleepiness, the danger of death. 

Then I tried weed, and OMG, it DOES live up to the hype. Funny thing, when I first tried it, I would only eat a pea size amount of raw flower, and funny thing, that worked! (it won't work now, my tolerance is now too high lol). Worked my way up to edibles, to concentrates, then finally flower. I still don't,  and won't, combust cannabis, but I love dry herb vape. I finally came to the conclusion, that I LIKE being a stoner. I LIKE being stoned, it makes my life so much enjoyable.  I stopped beating myself up for wanting the drug because why is it wrong to be happy to be pain free, to be happy in general . Weed has given me my life back in so many ways. I'm so very grateful to be living in a medical state. I would not have tried it at all if it weren't for this.",1
98,2019-10-23 13:37:48+00:00,"Ex husband was a “functional” heroin user for years, until he wasn’t. You built tolerance and need more to get you high. If you don’t, you become sick. To not become sick you take
Suboxine or methodone (good luck getting of those, as half life of these drugs is long and withdraw is worse than that of h). You live all of your life wanting it, taking these maintenance drugs just so you don’t relapse, these drugs byw affect your test production so basically sex life out of the window, adrenal glands all messed up. I mean who wants to be crippled for the rest of their lives?

103,2019-10-23 06:15:03+00:00,"Many chemicals can have positive results for one illness and negative effects for another, or certain effects when you have a disease and different effects when you don't. We hear about a single glass of wine having positive health benefits but drink 4 glasses a night and your liver will hate you. ADD meds are amazing for people that have the desiese but college kids still take it to party l night or stay up and write a paper. Opioids are great as painkillers and there are legitimate cases of people needing drugs like phentanol due to severe neurological damage or debilitating illnesses. Unfortunately people are irresponsible and regulations fail so the average person is stu k trying to find out the right thing from multiple studies both proving and disproving a point based on their agenda.",1

I'm trying to avoid an epidural because I really want to avoid laboring in bed on my back the whole time and would like the freedom to move around to keep things progressing.

I was actually at the point in my crazier period wherein I was changing dicetylmorphine number three into dicetylmorphine number four.

I got caught with some on me and the Gilbert Police Department agreed not to charge my wife with possession if I plead guilty to all the charges, including her weed pipe. I did.

125,2019-10-21 05:57:41+00:00,"Što se tiče najčešćih krivičnih dela, neko reče republički zavod za statistiku, tu ti je najbolje da vidiš tačne podatke. U suštini najčešće jeste imovinski kriminal (kradje), zatim telesne povrede, pa je i droga tu negde pretpostavljam.


Zakon često predvidja sasvim adekvatne kazne, ali problem je što se svi zakoni sprovode površno i delimično, za mnoga dela se često presudi kazna na zakonski minimum. Pored toga smatram da su kratke zatvorske kazne krajnje idiotske i ne služe svrsi, jer je period najčešće prekratak da se dodje do neke promene u čoveku, tako da samo služe prenatrpavanju zatvora i sisanju budžeta.


Što se tiče recidivizma (povrata), na to utiče puno faktora, ali činjenica je da je kod nas stopa recidivizma jako visoka. Neko je već pomenuo pravljenje krivičnih dela da bi osoba imala gde da prezimi i tri obroka dnevno, na žalost to nije tako redak slučaj. Pored toga veliki je problem adrese, mnogo njih kad izadje iz zavoda više nema adresu na kojoj bi se vodio, a neophodna im je zbog ličnih dokumenata pre svega. Pošto institucije ne mogu da postignu dogovor oko fiktivne adrese, osobe su često mesecima nakom izlaska u sukobu sa zakonom zbog nemanja dokumenata i jedna rutinska provera policije na ulici može da im napravi problem.



Ima njih koji su izašli čvrsto rešeni da se nikad ne vrate, takvi su i osnovali ovo udruženje gde volontiram, oni često imaju decu koju su videli par puta samo i slično, dakle motiv da nešto menjaju u životu. Ali to su uglavnom ljudi koji su služili malo duže kazne, 5+ godina, ovi koju odu na godinu-dve samo naprave nova poznanstva i ‘iskuju zanat’ pa se na ulicu vrate spremniji nego pre.
I naravno, veliki problem je što niko ne radi sa njima kvalitetno dok su u zatvoru. Ljudi koji su završili moj faks bi trebalo da  rade u zatvorima i utiču na kvalitativne promene u životima tih ljudi, ali živimo u Srbiji jelte, tako da posao ide u paketu sa stanačkom članskom kartom, a ne sa strukom. Brdo njih udje u zatvor kao zavisnici od heroina, a izadju kao zavisnici od bupinorfina, i to se smatra uspešnim tretmanom po njihovim poremećenim standardima.

126,2019-10-21 04:28:54+00:00,"&gt;The initial conversation was about whether or not fentanyl was being mixed directly into cocaine as a means of enhancing the high and then sold simply as ""cocaine"", not ""speedball powder"", not ""cocaine ft. fetanyl"", just ""cocaine"", and it is not. 

They literally never said that. They were just concise and you read way more into it than was actually there. “Here’s a speedball” makes no mention that it’s the same price but was cheaper to get because it’s fent and analogs and not actual heroin.

Cocaine OD deaths more than doubled over 2 years- adding over 5k deaths. They are nearly all attributable to fent, per that study. That’s not counting the many thousands more than OD’d and didn’t die.

&gt;Maybe some weirdos somewhere are doing it,

Nope. Data shows: mainstream. Your logical rhetoric is irrelevant. Data shows you’re incorrect.",1
127,2019-10-21 04:17:42+00:00,"If someone dies because they mixed fentanyl and cocaine, and they died from respiratory arrest as a result of fent, then it's disingenuous to call that a cocaine OD. It's like when they point to deaths where people took kratom, alcohol, and a bunch of pills, and say ""This guy died from kratom!"" The cocaine is not what killed them. It was certainly invited to the party, it certainly didn't help clean up, but it's not the one that trashed the place. Which is beside the point, the *initial conversation* was about whether or not fentanyl was being mixed directly into cocaine as a means of enhancing the high and then sold simply as ""cocaine"", not ""speedball powder"", not ""cocaine ft. fetanyl"", just ""cocaine"", and it is not. Most people who like coke are not into speedballing, and those that are have no trouble getting the two separate and mixing them themselves. Something like a fent/coke mixture that's pre-mixed makes zero sense, even if you're marketing to speedball folks, and even then you'd be *marketing to speedball folks*, you'd say right to their face, ""Hey, this has fent in it!"" It'd be part of the appeal. Maybe some weirdos somewhere are doing it, but it's so unlikely for the reasons I've already mentioned that to include them in the conversation as part of the overall epidemic is sensationalist",1
128,2019-10-21 04:12:58+00:00,"Yea but doing it every time you get drunk is when it becomes a problem. It usually starts with frequent boozing with a group of drinking buddies who pick up bags here and there. It's a social/party drug and it's pretty damn common. The cravings are strongest when you are drunkest and most likely to make shitty decisions. I don't know of any actual addicts that don't drink a lot as well.

The other issue with it is that it's too easy to nosedive into a bender, stay up all night, and make shitty decisions like spend more money on a bag cut with drywall from a sketchy dude that your drinking buddy met at a bar.

That being said it's really not that bad with extreme moderation (a few times a year at most) and caution (of fentanol/od), but isn't worth the trouble anyway.

So I hear at least.

No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

The real question is ""how deep does his partisanship go"", because to be honest, I could swing Conservative if their policy was handled correctly. If you ignore policy and automatically report to blue / red, YOU ARE NO BETTER. Sorry r/Greyl I know how this sounds but I'm not picking you out!! Just trying to make a couple points, brother/sister.

The thing is, policy is the only thing that matters. POLICY. Not by slander ads. Not by brainwashing your kids. Not by brainwashing your fucking students, Christian Schools (that is a whole other battle btw).

People lose sight of the details very quickly when they join a ""team"", even in Canada. We know this in Canada for the most part, so those people are outliers. Look at Max Bernier (I'm not going to make a joke here... it's killing me) However it is people like Maxine that give relevance to orders such as the Hardly Boys or the Alt-Reich.

But I ask all Canadians to not lose sight of your ideal country. When you look at how you'd like things to be, you can't help but agree it will be based on POLICY, not bullshit speculation or disruptive attack advertising. The whole point is for you to throw your keyboard / phone in disgust, and if you do, they already own your mind.

Rand Paul is one of very few Republicans that have stood up against the current health American health care system (loosely based verbiage on that one haha). There is so much that is right with that. I do agree with Canadians though, of course, a man with such power money and influence, flying north for HIS HEALTH CARE? Total hypocrite, but it speaks volumes about Canada doesn't it? Pat yourself on the back for once.

One thing the US needs to do is investigate their dealers. One simply needs to watch any doc about Oxycotin or was it Oxycodone? There's a bunch of versions, sold by legal drug dealers, which lead to the downfall of entire towns. Hence the doc on Netflix (DO IT)

""We had lines around the block for Oxy medications. They sold it to us as a better and less addictive product...""

Turns out they had salespeople motivated by golfing trips, yacht trips, you name it, in rewards from a multi-billion dollar corporation who.. woops, we forget who owns this subsidiary. Woops, we forget which firm formulated it. R&amp;D? Those went out the window when we had the fire. ""Which window"" You'd have to ask my boss. 

""Woops, this got out? I'm on camera right now because of my audacity towards money that has crippled thousands of people and their communities has finally been seen for what it is?

Got oxycodon and fentanyl, heavy opioids.

Comes in powder from leaves
 much more easy on the stomach. 
On eBay and such. 
Get up to speed on YouTube, very informative. 
Take same precautions as the morfine from our dokters. 
None of the dokters i met know of it. 
Wikipedia, check that. 
The red one is the best pain killer, it is also used as recreational drugs and as addictive as morfine. 
Do your homework ! It's not a toy. 

But it helps people with chronic pain. 

And find a dietitian that knows the Fodmap diet. And knows the pancreas

Eat very small portions six times a day.

 H1B visa workers from India who can barely do the work, but are half the cost of an American employee.

Towns in places like Minnesota with populations of 10,000 having five thousand Somalis and El Salvadorans being placed in our communities because ""They need assistance.""

The billions of dollars of opioids like fentinyl being shipped here from China.

The dual-citizens in Congress who care more about enriching the countries they actually care about instead of Americans.

153,2019-10-19 22:05:46+00:00,"Bit tired, lot of painkillers so excuse my all over the place answer. 

-First get enzymes

-Then must fix diet , 
Fodmap is a start. Do not worry bout al the reintroducing stuff 
Read the do and don't list

-Four times paracetamol 1000mg a day

-Eventually heavy opioids. 
If not available then kratom is a substitute that visits the same receptors and in the right dose will give you relieve
I have asked all the dokters I've seen none know it. 

-nerve blocking comes after that, but I also feel not completely informed. 

-Eventually they can take some of the pancreas out but that's a last resort. As I understand it. 
Diabetes is a risk then. 

But this is all my situation and there are different reasons the thing stops working en some extra complications can make it different. 


"" Is Kratom easy to find? ""

Kratom is online in bulk and many smartshops 
Websites 
Packed leaves or fine grind. 
There are different kinds, what I hear is that the red one kills the pain best, YouTube is my friend. There are a few. 
And from different countries, don't know if that makes any difference tho. 
But watch some YouTube for info on that. 

Smal dose is more trippy, big is more a painkiller
Start with no all to big doses. 
It grips onto almost all the same, maybe less or more, receptors as morfine does. 
Less painful stomach effects as oxycodon they say
It's an acquired taste , experiment with recipe's. 
There are also warnings from people who had bad experiences when stopping with kratom, maybe they did it cold turkey, don't know. 

You also can't stop oxycodon abruptly, personal opinion. 
I can't sleep and if i do wake up its completely wet, have to get a new shirt and an towel to lay on
Turn the pillow ...
And mental disoriented like hel. 
Not doing that anymore. 
I do every pil incrementally now, smallest steps possible. 

I have kratom as a backup, cause the regular painkillers from the dokter. 
Fentanyl and oxycodon ... Mixing is adding so bad idea. 
Stops you breathing I hear. 
I saw pretty colored patterns when I took them together ... Wasn't exactly what I was looking for at that point in time. 
Also stopping abruptly with those should be done in steps otherwise you will have a hard time. 
It's addictive to the body and mind , absolutely don't prefer cold turkey with any heavy opiods or antidepressants

"" If it gets to a somewhat more bearable stage where I’m not in debilitating pain 5 days a week, I will be more positive.""

Bout good days, you maybe need enzymes to help digest 
I take them with everything I eat just to be sure. 

And a diet, see a dietitian of find their advice online. 

Before I got enzymes the only advice from the hospital was a Fodmap diet !
For irritated bowl syndrome
Shocking adaptation but it really helpt for the pain in the left down going bowel, that had been burning like white fire for a really long time, two years. 

The badly digestion in the stomach dumps stuff in the bowl that is not ready for it. 
And you feel that almost all the way. 
For me the left was unbearable, white fire 

Not so much for the pain from the pancreas from front to back over left side. 
That took oxycodon and fentanyl. 
Got those after two years after a visit to the ER. 
And I had not been drinking for a really long time. 
And a different dokter. 
Before that they sent me away asking if I still had contact with mental health services ...
Send me away without painkillers and a badly copied sheet with that diet , couldn't read half of it. 

I did not want to see a doctor after that and smoked one hundred grams of weed a month
Just to cope and get some sort of sleep. 
Pain just wakes you up every two hours.


"" I just haven’t been given straight answers from doctors about the scope of what I’m dealing with until yesterday. And even now I don’t feel like I have answers. ""

I also had the not compleet informed feeling far to long. Still. 
Finally found this sub. 
I also stil need information on how to make this bearable. 

Dietist can really explain much more what is happening to you than a dokter in the hospital will. 
Mine gives it in small bits every six months I have my check
But the dietist gave me more insight on the process and wat it is I'm feeling. 

And it's important that you eat small portions more times a day. Like six. 
Don't make the the pancreas work like it once could do, it will never do that again. 
Takes a lot of discipline, and pain is your teacher. 
Less is more 

Avoid sugar !
Very difficult and frustrating, but that's a lot of work for the machine to digest. 
The enzymes have to cut that all up and that's not an option anymore. 
You don't make enough. 

So I have two places of pain now. 
Pancreas and bowels. 

To much painkillers, that still are not enough, and bowel stops working
Not enough puts me in a chair. 
Food experiments can block the bowel and stomach fills up so it starts to push up to the middle rif, that is also painful
That's also when you eat to much, like a spoon or two ...
Cause your not digesting in the stomach it wil not yet be dumpt in the bowels. 
That can take a while, ik go lay on top of it with all my weight and wait. 
On the back laying and with the hand helping the natural direction of food in the pipes giving slow massage also helps getting it on its way. 

Hold strong and hang in there. 
Your truly f...... And I feel your pain.

 ### RIGOR

 O promotor afirma que cumpriu a sua obrigação. “Sou muito rigoroso e tenho a consciência tranquila.”

 ### AGULHAS E BOTÕES

216,2019-10-15 22:01:19+00:00,"*hugs* I'm so sorry for the pain you are feeling.

My son came at 28+5 after almost 9 weeks fighting my rapidly shortening cervix. I felt like a failure and tortured myself with very little sleep and constant guilt over it. 

I can empathize with your pain about your daughter: my son had to be transfered from our NICU to a special children's hospital in a huge city, for assessment. He had hydrocephalus, which means that the fluid in his brain was building up and swelling his head. He had suffered 2 brain bleeds before being born and they were threatening his survival.

He was there for about 2 weeks. 1 week in I became ill.. hes being given an mri that day to determine if he needs brain surgery, they doped him up on morophine so he would stay still... needed a blood transfusion to be stable enough before they could do the procedure. Hes just this tiny little doll body poked all over and instead of being there, i had to hop a bus home and sit there on the couch. 

There are certain feelings that have common links to different experiences... but that if you havent felt in person, they are indescribable. 

Love your son. Love your daughter. If you are the praying type or not, say a wish or prayer every night for your daughter. Call and talk to her nurses after shift changes so you know someone has checked on her as an individual and given her some comforting touch. If you can, sign her up for hand hugs from volunteers for days you cant be there. And when you can, hold her and whisper to her that she is strong, flexible and a warrior.  She will overcome this. 

When she is over the flu, perhaps see if your baby boy can visit her. Twins sometimes stabilize from being put together. If it works, take one of your son's worn onsies (pretty clean one lol) and place it in her incubator. She will know his smell from the womb and it will be a comforting presence for her .

Withdrawal effects of opioids are pretty much 'strength' dependent. Since the maximum dose of less than 50g of Kratom powder doesn't come anywhere near to a couple of 5 mg Oxycodon pills, withdrawal is far more mild than with the other available drugs.


There are a few opioid agonists that at the same time interact with the body to block the upregulation of opioid receptors (which is what causes dependency) but those have been in research for the last twenty years without any significant discoveries.",1

The rich Jewish Sachler family has been allowed to sell oxycotin all over the place in the US and Canada. The justice system here in many States tried to sue them but they just declared bankrupcy to avoid it. So they killed many people and get to keep all their money.

The divorce system is built to destroy the family unit. The legal system in general is biased against men. I know a woman who stole 22 million pesos and bankrupted a college, she only got 3 years in prison. Meanwhile men commit lesser crimes and get 5 years.

The things you want, you only think you want, once you actually get them, you can't get rid of them.

Once you get highly entrenched corruption like you have in North America, a holy sort of unquestionable corruption that people are brainwashed into thinking is right, then you can never get rid of it. We still have a drug epidemic but it is allowed to go on forever. Meanwhile you guys actually address your drug problems in your country.

Singapore kills people for drug smuggling and they are doing great. Follow their example. The west is shit.

Your GDP is huge because your country is having lots of babies. Our GDP is garbage and the elderly are getting abused in hospitals because they have no family to take care of them.

No nurses will do anything other than check his pulse.

You are wrong, family is still essential, all healthcare sucks (private and public), all governments are corrupt no matter where you are and you fell for the western propaganda that somehow everything is better here.

251,2019-10-14 12:38:09+00:00,"I would say yes, because of the importance of an ascension to heaven in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Literature. [I wrote this on my blog](https://readingacts.com/2019/01/24/acts-1-the-ascension-and-the-return-of-jesus/) quite a while ago, but here is a bit more detail: 

The verb translated “taken up” is used only for very special individuals who are taken to heaven by God. There are two ascensions in the Hebrew Bible, Enoch in Genesis 5:24 and Elijah in 2 Kings 2:11.  According to Jewish tradition Moses ascended to heaven as well (Antiq. 4.8.48). Ezra has a similar experience in 4 Ezra 14:49, and Baruch is translated in 2 Baruch 76.2.

After Jesus ascends, a cloud hides him from the disciples’ sight. The cloud may be taken as an allusion to Dan 7:13, where the son of man comes on the cloud.  In that context, however, the messianic figure is coming on the clouds, rather than returning to heaven.  The could is likely the glory of God, since a cloud is a frequent image in Hebrew Bible for the glory of God (Ex 16:10, Ps 104:3, plus the transfiguration, Luke 9:34-34, Rev 11:12).  

These are not mutually exclusive options, since the cloud in Dan 7 may refer to the glory of God – it is not the vehicle for the ascension but rather an indication that Jesus has been ultimately glorified after the resurrection.  

That the glory of God should ascend to heaven from the Mount of Olives invokes some key texts from the Hebrew Bible. In Ezekiel 10 the glory of God departs from the Temple, 10:19 specifically states that it left via the east Gate, just as Jesus was on the east side of the Temple when he ascended.  

When the Glory of God leaves the Temple, the judgment on Israel is assured.  But it is important to observe that there is a gap between the Glory leaving and  the actual destruction of the Temple.  There is a brief interim, just as in the book of Acts, between the Glory of the Lord leaving and the ultimate judgment on Israel. Zechariah 14 describes the Glory of God returning to the Mount of Olives at the time of the establishment of the kingdom.  Zech 14:14 specifically states that the Lord himself will place his feet on the Mount of Olives to the east of Jerusalem, establishing his authority over the whole earth.",1

Fent is strong enough to break through the bupe.  Bupe got a super high affinity to the opioid receptors, because of that you need a) super big amounts of opioids to break through (high OD chance) or b) Fentany or fentdope to break through, I would start small cause also with fent you got a super high OD chance.

Whenever I drink I feel a great high, but as the night winds down I find myself contemplating suicide and crying in my shower for an hour. I know what to do and how to make myself feel better but I don't do it and I don't know why. With drugs it started because of school. My parents have always been supportive, but at the same time not. They would say I don't care about how other kids are doing in school you need to do better, but then say how other kids are doing better than I am. This pushed me into Adderall and then later into Oxycodine, because I couldn't sleep with Adderall very well. Going into college I had a bad break up with a friend, let's call him Ben, when we started a summer fling. In a nutshell he never told me his feelings so when I made out with our best friend he felt disrespected. I do admit both me and our friend said nothing would happen between us even after he said it was okay if we hooked up, but at the end of the day we did make out. Ben found out about my addiction and that I made out with our friend and called me saying I was too much to handle. About an hour later I am at the train tracks ready to jump off. Once he finds out I did almost killed myself he said I am an attention whore and I am faking all of this. That it's insane I did this because we are ending out fling, which I admit was a factor, but it was mostly due to him calling me too much to handle. I said to him I don't blame him and at the end of the day my actions are my own and I own up to them. About a week later I started college with my depression at an all time high. Ben and I still talk, but this soon ends once he finds out I still have feelings for him. I got a weird phone call from him saying how I still like him and how he's over me and then he just stops talking to me. I text him if we could still be friends and he says he doesn't know. This is all happening while my therapist and psychiatrist are trying to figure out what is wrong with me. I find out a couple day's later I might have bipolar 2.

Now I'm trying to transfer out of my school while fighting with my parents about it. I am still having a bad alcohol and drug problem on top of that. I feel like I'm just living my life for other people and I'm numbing my emotions so I don't have to face them.

Eu acho que isso me ajudou a entender uma variedade muito grande de pessoas, desde gente famosa como voce, a gente completamente anonima ignorada pelo mundo. Desde gente sem educacao formal, ate alguns dos maiores pesquisadores do mundo.

Se voce doa, mas nao esta perto pra ver o impacto, por exemplo, muita coisa fica mais dificil.

Also, by what you said, would you like to see your mother being denied opioids after heavy thoraic surgery? Or removal of large intestine? 



Yes, you escalate the dose of opioid when lower becomes non-effective. That is literally the point of oxycodone/hydromorphone/fentanyl/etc, the highest dose is not limited. 



You say we need to get used to pain. By what you said, it seems to me that you also consider any form of anaesthesia in surgery as bad. Deal with the pain. Sure, having some painful condition does not require pain management, but you know what, I guess if you can make somebody productive by taking opioids, or even ease their pain it counts, it is humane. 99% of hydrocodone is used by Americans - yes, for example in my country hydrocodone is not even registered. Another faulty argument. Also, can you please name one good thing that is originally Soviet thing? No. I doubt you even lived under heavy soviet influence. 



But anyway, I look forward to your heart transplantation and how you make it thru the surgery and hospital say after said surgery without any opioid. I will take some fentanyl (that I am prescribed) and I will think of you and hope you change your opinion.

282,2019-10-11 08:32:14+00:00,"Just because the Soviets did something doesn't mean it's the wrong move.

My statement about them being for terminally ill patients is based on a few things. 

1. Extended release and high potency opioids (oxycontin, MScontin, fentanyl patches, etc) were literally invented for end of life care. Why? Because they're powerful drugs with significant and dangerous side effects. They're designed to ease the pain of literal dying with the full knowledge that they may often hasten the process.

2. Opiates, whether given for an acute or chronic pain conditions, will grow less effective with time. Someone who starts on a low dose, low potency opiate will eventually require a higher dose or more potent form to keep the same level of pain control. It's simply how they work. The body will eventually make more pain receptors that require more drug to block. This happens in as quickly as *three days*. In fact, the body begins to have hyperalgesia after this point-- feeling *more* pain from the same stimulus as they would have if they had never been exposed to the opiate.  

3. The drugs are not designed to be stopped. Once a patient crosses the threshold for receptor up-regulation, the patient becomes physically dependent on the drug. Stopping the drug will lead to withdrawal and increased pain *even if the original painful condition has resolved*. The drugs act in such a way that unless you're exposed to them for a very short period, stopping them becomes increasingly difficult. Many people will find it impossible to stop using them without enduring weeks of agony. 

4. If the drugs can't be stopped and continue to require escalation, it leads to some difficult positions. A patient who starts on daily hydrocodone will have to increase that dose until they require daily oxycodone, then hydromorphone, then some combination of a long acting opiate like oxycontin or fentanyl patches. I've personally treated patients who were on opiate doses 10x higher than the amount that would kill an opiate naive patient and they were *still in pain*. Not too long ago I took care of someone with a morphine milligram equivalent (MME) of just over 2,000-- 40x above the limit that the CDC warns seriously increases risk of overdose. He had been given the meds for back pain but was now presenting with a new terminal and extremely painful condition, was in agony, and had very little left that we could do to help him. 

5. The farcical idea that there are groups of people who ""need"" opiates (like in the often used line ""these regulations prevent the people who really need the drugs from getting them"") is one sold to us by drug companies and is based on an almost entirely Western (and specifically American) misconception of pain ""control"". 

99% of hydrocodone used *globally* is used by Americans. Less than 5% of the world's population accounted for almost 100% of hydrocodone consumption.

Americans have learned to expect that they do not have to experience pain for any reason. They expect injuries and even surgeries to be completely pain free. Turns out, life is painful. 

Having a painful condition does not mean that someone ""needs"" opiates. Sickle cell disease is a great example of this. Palliative care has created a culture for many groups of sickle cell patients that because their condition is painful that they *need* opiates. This has created an unstoppable machine of opiate addiction where children as young as 3 and 4 years old are started on high dose opiate therapies that they will be physically and psychologically dependent on their entire lives. The hyperalgesia and addiction/dependence phenomenon occurs in this group just like any other. Opiate dependence plays such a large role in sickle cell disease in America, it's hard to see significant quality of life improvement compared to a sickle cell patient in Nigeria despite having many more resources in the US. 

At the end of the day, no one *needs* opiates. Generally speaking, no one dies of pain. Opiates do not cure any medical problem or disease. But they are the source of a number of them and kill 70,000 Americans per year and destroy the lives of countless others. Opiates are a temporary solution designed for temporary problems that has been retrofitted onto permanent problems and it has cost us hundreds of thousands of lives in doing so.",1

284,2019-10-11 07:47:20+00:00,"I'm not up to date on their composition since reformulation. For the most part the biggest concern are particles under 50 microns in size as cigarette filters and cotton is essentially worthless for them. They will build up in your bloodstream (can't dissolve, but get injected and caught in small vessels), and especially places you really don't want them like vessels in your lungs. Yeah, it's fucking weird, but snorting and injecting pills will actually fuck up lungs pretty well over time. With years of it on you, I would really strongly advise doing all you can to stop further damage. It will cost you in yield and filters, not huge, but let's face it most opiate addicts aren't big on waste eh?

There is some additive common in pills that rides the line between soluble and insoluble in water, and idiots that cook their shots manage to push it over the edge into soluble territory, where it promptly precipitates in one's bloodstream. I am drawing a blank right now, but cold shots are highly important with pills especially.

Here is an excellent article explaining exactly how effective common filters are and what loss you can expect with them. It's based on MSContin, but will still apply for your situation. Biggest difference is likely to be whatever the current outer coating is, which I am not up to date on. Sorry. Strongly recommend reading the first few paragraphs at least, along with any sections on filtering methods you are willing to consider.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803777/

Ideally you would crush your pill(s) and cold water extract that, leave the solids. Then cotton/cig filter or equivalent, then wheel filter/micron filter. If you rinse a time or two you are looking at 80-90% yield of the good stuff with virtually no particulate, insoluble or semi soluble.

The cotton/cig filter before micron filter can be skipped and exists more to prevent clogging and thus accidental or frustrated bypassing/other loss.

Those little filters you are talking about, I assume I have had them before from an exchange. They are roughly equivalent to a cig filter in filtering ability but without added risks.

If you were a powder/tar user I wouldn't be stressing this nearly as much. Not if you just occasionally injected pills. Hope you look into this. That literature is useful, I promise. If you want to avoid nasty health complications 5+ years down the road the costs of playing it safe now have to be paid.


Microcrystalline cellulose isn't water soluble technically. In a basic/caustic and hot solution it does edge into soluble territory. Shouldn't be a significant issue, but with basic enough water in a boiled shot a small amount (small) is going to dissolve and crash out in the blood.",1

 Lee não ficou louco. Neste novo longa, Smith, de 51 anos, precisa interpretar um assassino com sua idade real, mas também o seu jovem clone, de 23 anos, que o caça por alguma razão misteriosa.

 “O problema é que Will é um ator muito melhor hoje em dia do que há 30 anos”, diz o cineasta ao lado do seu astro, em um evento para a imprensa. “Ang me mostrava algumas interpretações antigas minhas e falava: ‘Essa atuação aqui não é boa. Preciso que faça igual’. Tive de ver todas as tragédias que cometi no entretenimento”, completa Smith às gargalhadas.

Mas o grande desafio de “Projeto Gemini” passa longe de ser a busca por um Will Smith canastrão. A produção teve início em 1995, quando o roteiro de Darren Lemke, de “Shazam!”, sobre um matador perseguido por sua versão mais jovem, começou a chamar a atenção em Hollywood.

  Diretores como Tony Scott, Curtis Hanson e Joe Carnahan se interessaram. A [Disney](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/08/disney-apresenta-suas-armas-para-a-guerra-dos-streamings-em-convencao-nos-eua.shtml), na época, desenvolveu um trabalho para tentar replicar versões mais jovens de alguns atores que poderia protagonizar o longa, casos de Harrison Ford e Arnold Schwarzenegger.

 “Os testes ficaram horríveis. Tentamos rejuvenescer Jack Nicholson e foi péssimo. Chegamos à conclusão de que não seria possível fazer o filme com a tecnologia disponível. Era preciso esperar avançar ao ponto de se equiparar à criatividade do roteiro”, diz o produtor Jerry Bruckheimer, que assumiu o projeto.

 Com o roteiro lapidado por David Benioff, de “Game of Thrones”, e Billy Ray, de “Jogos Vorazes”, “Projeto Gemini” ganhou nova vida com Ang Lee, que gostou da experiência de criar personagens virtuais em “Hulk” (2003) e “As Aventuras de Pi”. “Ele disse que conseguiria fazer quando viu alguns longas usando o rejuvenescimento digital. Mas ainda não estávamos prontos para um ser humano totalmente digital e ainda é muito caro”, explica Bruckheimer.

 Lee faz questão de exaltar que a tecnologia usada em “Projeto Gemini”, que teve orçamento de US$ 138 milhões, não é a mesma usada em[ “Capitã Marvel” ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/03/capita-marvel-apresenta-heroina-de-poder-cosmico-em-aventura-arrebatadora.shtml)ou “O Irlandês”. “Criamos algo nunca visto. É um personagem virtual”, diz o cineasta sobre a criação de Júnior, o Will Smith jovem que persegue o original mais velho. “Eu queria ser o primeiro a fazer isso.”

 Ao lado de uma equipe com cerca de 500 especialistas em efeitos especiais, o diretor reuniu fotos e áudios do ator com 23 anos para criar um molde digital da cara dele. Smith filmava duas vezes a mesma cena quando interagia com seu clone —uma na locação, quando o ator enfrentava um dublê que teria o rosto substituído por sua face jovem digital, e outra em estúdio, cercado por fundos verdes, com as câmeras capturando sua performance real em detalhes.

 “É fascinante e perturbador imaginar você encontrando sua versão mais jovem. E isso para mim é a razão da existência do cinema”, diz Ang Lee, que ainda procurou uma encrenca maior ao filmar 120 quadros por segundo (em vez dos tradicionais 24), deixando a projeção mais nítida —mas com um visual “de novela”.

 “O cinema muda constantemente. Espero que outros se unam a mim nesta experiência de imersão. Meu objetivo é retratar os momentos íntimos da maneira mais real possível. Sinto que estou próximo disso”, diz o diretor de 64 anos. “Não sei o porquê de as pessoas saltarem de paraquedas por diversão, mas deve ser o mesmo sentimento que tenho ao fazer um filme assim.”",1

 Frases ditas no passado por ambos contrastam com as mágoas de fim de relação expostas nos últimos dias, em meio [à iminente saída de Bolsonaro do partido](https://painel.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/10/09/integrantes-da-cupula-do-psl-sao-avisados-de-que-bolsonaro-quer-deixar-o-partido/) presidido pelo deputado federal.

 O presidente da República [detonou a crise ao falar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/esquece-o-psl-afirma-bolsonaro-ao-criticar-presidente-de-seu-partido.shtml) que o cacique do PSL está ""queimado pra caramba"".

Ele pode levar tudo do partido, só não pode levar a dignidade"".

  Antes, tudo era diferente.

 Em janeiro de 2018, quando os dois [anunciaram a ida do então presidenciável para a sigla](https://painel.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/01/05/e-com-orgulho-que-o-psl-recebe-o-jair-bolsonaro-diz-termo-assinado-pelo-pre-candidato-ao-planalto/), sobraram afagos de parte a parte.

 Bivar disse que recebia o colega ""com muito orgulho"". Bolsonaro afirmou sentir ""muita honra"" e estar ""muito à vontade"" ao entrar para as fileiras de ""um partido onde existe total comunhão de pensamentos"".

 Dias depois do anúncio, [em entrevista à **Folha**](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/01/1949909-bolsonaro-e-um-liberal-completo-diz-presidente-do-psl.shtml), o dirigente da legenda e deputado federal por Pernambuco se derramou em elogios. Descreveu o pré-candidato ao Planalto como um liberal completo.

 ""Não vejo nada no comportamento dele que contradiga a ideologia liberal, na área econômica ou social"", assinalou Bivar, buscando dirimir dúvidas sobre o perfil do capitão.

 Minimizou ainda o [apreço de Bolsonaro ao coronel Carlos Alberto Brilhante ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml)[Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml), um dos símbolos da repressão durante a ditadura militar no Brasil, e a [afirmação de que só não estupraria a colega Maria do Rosário (PT-RS)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/por-ordem-judicial-bolsonaro-pede-desculpas-a-deputada-maria-do-rosario-do-pt.shtml) porque ela ""não merecia"".

 A série de palavras dóceis se estendeu também à família.

 Nesse ponto, contudo, parece que ele não mudou de percepção. Nesta quarta-feira (9), no auge da ameaça de rompimento, [o presidente da sigla disse ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/bolsonaro-quer-descartar-psl-para-se-reeleger-em-2022-diz-luciano-bivar.shtml)[achar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/bolsonaro-quer-descartar-psl-para-se-reeleger-em-2022-diz-luciano-bivar.shtml) ""muito humildes"" os herdeiros do outrora aliado.

 Apesar dos abraços que deu em Bivar em 2018 ao [oficializar a adesão ao ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/03/jair-bolsonaro-se-filia-ao-psl-para-disputar-o-planalto.shtml)[PSL](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/03/jair-bolsonaro-se-filia-ao-psl-para-disputar-o-planalto.shtml), posando sorridente para as câmeras, Bolsonaro sempre se comportou de maneira mais discreta ao se referir ao dirigente partidário.

 Formal, limitou-se a dizer na época da filiação que fez ""um acordo maravilhoso"" com o líder do partido.

 Em um vídeo disponível no YouTube gravado após fechar a parceria, o então presidenciável desfia planos para a campanha e encerra: ""É muito bom conversar com pessoas como Luciano Bivar"".

 Em outra rara menção pública sobre ele, Bolsonaro disse no início do ano eleitoral que acreditava na promessa de Bivar de abrir espaço na direção da sigla ao recém-chegado.

 ""Confio na palavra dele [Bivar]. Não vou desconfiar dele"", assinalou o hoje presidente da República.

 Alheio ao fogo cruzado, o site oficial do PSL destacava até esta quarta-feira uma homenagem a Bivar atribuída a Bolsonaro. Sob a foto do presidente do partido, lia-se a frase lisonjeira: ""Luciano não é arquiteto, mas construiu a ponte para a mudança do Brasil"".

""We have been meaning to update everyone on my illness. In April we had exploratory surgery. They cut a 6 inch incision between my ribs on my right side and forced thee ribs apart. Took samples ov tissue from my lungs and heart and inserted tubes to suck our thick viscous fluid that was reducing my lung capacity to around 35%.
We have never experienced such pain as after we woke from thee general anaesthetic!!! We were screaming as we came around. In thee I.C.U. we were on high doses ov Fentenyl and morphine, with lidocaine around my wounds. On a scale ov one to ten thee pain was still ELEVEN...

It took almost 3 months for thee wounds to heal butter left me with coum cool scars, and SADLY two ruptured breast implants leaking silicone :( We don't know if those were connected to thee surgery in any way. My leaking implants are problematic and need removing and replacing to remove one more negative stress on my system. Needless to say we have no funds for this surgery which might really help my breathing. If you really want to assist my coumtinuing stabilising of my condition this is a perfect momeant to add to my Go Fund Me set up by Chandra Shuckla. Thee leakage is most likely affecting my breathing.

Sadly all these months later my breathing is still severely reduced. Still around 35% ov my capacity. My heart has coum calcification, butter so far is still pumping quite well.

My weekly blood tests showed a gradual unwelcoum decline in my levels. So we have been put on intravenus chemo now.

Originally it was 3 days chemo every 4-5 weeks. However my levels have not improved after 3 months so today we began a
new regimen ov FIVE daze chemo every TWO weeks !!!

My closest friends like Roxy and Alice and Leigha and Jarrett have been taking turns minding me during thee chemo as we must have coumone watching over me 24x7 during those daze.

Our One True TOPI Tribe coumtinues to protect and nurture me. Which includes all ov you. Your loving support has been incredible. On darkest days we remember how my great dream ov an autonomous tribe that coalesces when needed from a place ov generosity. Thank you and my chosen famille.

Caresse and Genesse live 3000 miles away in California. Yet they too have made supreme efforts to be here caregiving when their lives allow it.

We have an oxygenator, thanks to thee GoFundMe. Which is thee only reason we can walk outside my apartment at all. Thank you all for this. It is LITERALLY a life saver. Despite having that, to walk to my corner store we have to walk very very slowly and pause 2 or 3 times to regulate my breathing enough to walk coum more. It's only about 140 metres to thee store altogether. Believe me it really sucks to be tethered to a heavy machine and tube to be able to breathe most of every day.

Summarising. We are fighting to remain relatively stable. Coum ov my symptoms are still a ""mystery"" to quote my Drs. Any donations are desparately needed.We are hoping this might help my breathing.

On Lady Jaye's Memorial Day, her TENTH ANNIVERSARY ov dropping her body. We send you all BIG L-ov-E and dreams.

DON'T LIFT ANYTHING HEAVY! That includes picking up a friend if the fell drunk. That could put you in hospital with a hernia or tear something. 

Shotgun sounds like a terrible idea for you. Recoil could hurt you.

Travelling, you wont be driving. Too risky if you have to brake suddenly to you and passengers. You may react badly to the pain and accelerate again.

You probably will be off painkillers. If not, dont drink. Stronger meds like morphene especially. Side effects could be disasterous. Worth checking with your doctors when its ok or safe to drink again.

If you can drink. Dont get drunk. If you have a stoma, you dont want to deal with it drunk or end up passed out with bag overfilling or passing too much too quickly from bowel. You will end up with leaks in the early days. Best to reduce the risk of waking up cover in shite away with friends.
Regardless of bag or resection, plan toilets along the trip. Bag could fill quickly or you could need a toilet in the next couple minutes suddenly. Disconnected, the bowel still produces mucous you will have to pass and often with sudden urge.

You can use the disabled toilet. Dont be afraid to use it. With a stoma, it gives room to empty without much splash back. Normal toilets are usable but i find them to cramped to empty close to the toilet. Im 1.96m so its a long way down. 4 weeks in i still found it difficult to crouch low enough for the toilet when not at home",1

Take any essential psychology class. Dopamine is an essential chemical and is released in different levels, masturbation and porn releases an intense amount of dopamine similar to morpheine. A constant stream of masturbation reduces your dopamine receptors and any small and simple task becomes an obstacle as smaller tasks no longer provide sufficient dopamine.

You know absolutely nothing about any of this, which is saying something since even I’ll admit I only know the basics of how brain chemistry and dopamine functions.

Getting an epidural was scary as hell to me, and I got stuck twice, but once in it was amazing! I didn’t feel anything during the surgery pain-wise. You definitely feel discomfort though as they tug and do what they need to in order to get baby out. 

I thought it’d be rather quick- get baby out, stitched up and put you go. That’s not accurate. It’s get baby out, get placenta out, scrape on uterus a bit, close several layers of things. I felt like getting baby out was 1/4 of my time in the room. You can see baby after they pull them out (at least in my hospital) if you choose to, and/or hold after they clean them up.

You are then sent to a recovery area where you can spend time with baby as they monitor you. My nursing staff helped me figure out the initial latch to feed my son.

Then you go into your room where you’ll be for the remainder of your stay. I suggest taking the pain killers on time. For example, I got oxycodon, 2 hrs later was Tylenol 800 mg, 2 hours later was something else. I called my nurse to ask for my next pill, whether I felt I needed it or not for the first 2 days. I wanted to stave off pain since they want you to walk around to help prevent clots. 

I highly suggest getting a type of depends for the post-partum bleeding. It goes up high over your sutures or staples, feels more comfortable to me than the mesh underwear, and I leaked less wearing them. You’ll likely be sitting on those pads that look like puppy pads. Put a pad over your sutures to a) keep the area dry and b) help prevent any chafing or pain when bending/moving.

My third/fourth day I started weaning myself off the meds as my pain became more bearable. When I got home I only took Tylenol 800s every so often, though I had my oxy prescription just in case. I know some people need to be in pain meds longer.",1

333,2019-10-06 17:39:02+00:00,"I have self reflected a lot about this topics you mention.

I've had a really rough time for the last 2 years, but I don't want to write about the 2 years publicly in here. Short story: many traumatic experiences which are the real reason I'm still taking drugs. I constantly have my improvements, but other things that happen can cause an easier relapse. The last one I had was very unlucky, because I quit benzos few weeks before. 

The last incident that happened was really rough (armed robbery at home) , because after it I didn't feel safe at home and my home was just an anxiety trigger (even if I wasn't at home). I was in a situation where it's really easy to fall into a benzo addiction. Helped against anxiety, helped for sleeping. I tried to work, easy job, but I was just cleaning rooms. Problem while cleaning I could still think about everything especially the last incident, leading to more panic attacks. I get them prescribed, it's not like I spent money on it. 

Yeah, it's possible I take opiods every other week but it doesn't seem like a problem for me at the moment, totally under control. While trying to work after the incident, I tried to quit benzos with a short Oxycodon stint(max a week IIRC). Worked somehow, I could make a benzo break, didn't have any withdrawal in rehab. Against doctor's advice, I stopped taking them in rehab, stayed sober for a few days. 

I just smoke weed now, every evening before I go to sleep, not much and just for improved sleep quality. I was thinking if I should quit it totally, but the pros outweigh the cons. At least for the moment. 

Not everything at once, Rome wasn't built on a day. 

You saw about MMA Stuff and Mario Video Game I posted about? Maybe that is my procrastination I try to get rid of? Endless informing about unimportant stuff? 
Btw: it's not MMA, it's pro wrestling. And I rarely watch a show, watch maybe some highlights posted in squared circle or in YouTube. But that is also something I want to get rid of and I do of pure boredom. 

Unemployed for 1.5 years. That's probably my main problem. Obviously there's something I'm doing wrong. So many rejects. Very low success quote for me. I can write a job app, even friends helped me and it didn't matter. It was just a lot of stress which was breaking me because I wanted to work ASAP and I couldn't handle to write a good application. I don't have better self esteem after over a year of rejections which means it doesn't get easier. 

I don't understand what you mean with your sarcastic comment about this course. It's free, it can't make my applications worse and my jobcenter has offered it to me.  Why not? At least something to do 4h a day and the only thing coming to my mind which could improve my chances for a job.

I don't see the point in comparing learning language and writing applications for a job? Learning a language has no psychological effect like anxiety/stress/depression. I'm learning a language to train my brain and look how well I do. It also doesn't have  the pressure as looking for a job and it's not like I have just one chance to show I'm better as the other learners. 

I won't stay at home forever but I will leave my Appartement on the end of November. I concentrate myself at the course, afterwards I will invest more time to find a job. Starting a job as soon as I moved out. Even my doctor said I should take this break. 

Trying to do everything asap without thinking about my mental health, never really recover, always stress about not having/finding a work and not being able to write a good application were reasons for being unemployed for a bit longer. 

Sorry, but I couldn't find the advice?",1

Shanann Watts was known to work from her husband’s personal cell phone as well, even logging into his Facebook account to post Thrive-raving posts for him. As noted by police, two Google searches were deleted — (""how to delete Instagram account"" was the other) therefore they have no way of knowing when the searches were conducted.",1

338,2019-10-06 12:37:11+00:00,Rather than Opiods - just make it addiction in general...  In Winnipeg - we have a huge meth epidemic going on and only recently have they started talking about that instead of fentinyl.,1

340,2019-10-06 01:16:11+00:00,"&gt; My husband told me a story from when he was deployed. A soldier broke his femur and on the helicopter they gave him a fentanyl lollipop. That he went from screaming and incoherent in pain to just quietly sucking on it. At one point the bird jerked and it fell out of his mouth and this big dude was screaming ""where's my sucker?! I want my sucker!"" 

That's way different from my fentayl experience. I don't know the dose (Iv delivery after a major surgery), pain relief lasted maybe 20-40 seconds but during that pain relief, the only way I could describe the feeling would be: ""what it feels like to die.""

Absolutely nothing pleasurable, ""high-like"", or anything I'd want to experience again. Still better than the pain. But all I took from it was ""people take this shit for fun? wtf is wrong with them?""",2

Painkillers aren't the problem, you seem to think we shouldn't prescribe them at all. It's about prescribing long lasting supplies of them. It's how we treat people when they're already addicted.

Imagine being an addict, and being told ""help is everywhere"". You go to look for that help. The methadone clinic has a 2 month waiting list, Suboxone has a similar wait time.

""Fuck me, I'll probabaly die before another 2 months is up"", so you look for a detox facility. The detox facility is 2 weeks out, but that you can do.

You get there, and realize they don't believe in science-based detox. They believe in ""medication free detox"" where they let you suffer without so much as an Advil.

After that, it's off to equestrian therapy where you interact with horses to cure your addiction. Or a work camp for ""work therapy""

See, in the US, there are very little requirements to call yourself ""a rehab"". You can basically put up a building with seperate rooms, and legally call it a rehab without even a single actual medical professional there in some states.

So you leave there and you're like ""that didn't help"", so you go to get into the methadone clinic. You wait through their waiting list, but they turn you away because ""it's not bad enough""

You think ""Fuck I'm putting a 1/2 gram of shit I buy off the street into my veins at once and it's not bad enough""

354,2019-10-05 01:51:33+00:00,"Weird. I'm very experienced with all forms of heroin and methods of use. Did you snort it? Smoke it? Inject it? Also how much did you do? If it was your first time, the way you describe it makes me believe it was cut with fentanyl (something all too common these days, and very deadly). 

""Passing out"" is pretty normal, although it's normally referred to as nodding out. I have OD'd once, but obviously I'm alive because I'm writing this. I also haven't done any heroin since January 2011, but I am not against it, nor against those who use it.

The vomitting is pretty normal for any first time user of any strong opiate, although it's usually pleasurable. Well, let me clarify it. The sudden nausea and sudden urge to vomit isn't pleasant, but after the vomitting is over, it should feel pleasant, and you should have continued to feel good.

If your boyfriend has been doing this for a while, and has a high tolerance, and is just doing it from being dopesick, the fentanyl it was cut wouldn't really effect him, he'd probably think it's just really good dope. 

I'm glad you're alive and that your boyfriend at least performed CPR. I'm not judging him negatively, but in reality he should have called an ambulance, or if he's a long time user, at least be smart enough to carry around some narcan in the event of an overdose for himself or others.

If you want advice from a former opiate and IV heroin addict, staying with your boyfriend is not a good idea, if you want to better your life. Also, addiction sneaks up fast. You might do it again and have a more pleasant experience, and think you are in control of it, and do it when you want to do it, but before long it steals your soul and you will do anything to get more, and might actually overdose.

Also, if you want to experiment with heroin again, I'd advise to get a fentanyl testing kit, to make sure you're getting diactylmorphine (heroin) and not heroin cut with fentanyl which is all too common. 

I'm not glorifying or advocating you or anyone else do heroin, but there are safety and precautionary methods to take that weren't taken to ensure you had a good first experience. 

If your boyfriend is a long time user, and you were the one who forced him to let you see what it's like (i've witnessed this firsthand) there's a good chance his normal dose is soooo high compared to a first time user, that he gave you more than a normal first time dose, without taking into consideration you were a heroin and opiate virgin. 

Depression and suicidal thoughts are common factors that lead people to use drugs, but from experience the drugs are just a band-aid, and create more problems for you than you already had, albeit, when you're addicted to heroin, you're in this weird state. you either feel normal or high, or dope sick. There is no in between. In a way it does take your problems away, because your whole life revolves around heroin to ""fix your problems"", yet when you run out, your only problem is coming up with a way to get more money to get more heroin. 

Heroin should be a pleasant experience so I'm convinced he gave you too much or more likely than not, it had fentanyl in it.",1

&gt;&gt;PiticiGratis 2.0: cinematografia s-a facut tot timpul din banii statului. piata e prea mica sa poti scoate profit dintr-un film fara sa dea bani si statul. in istoria romaniei nu a existat asa ceva.                   
&gt;&gt;repet. banii sunt alocati si pierduti de acolo. mai departe la cine sunt impartiti e irelevant ca-s pierduti. te ajuta cu ceva sa aiba alt film 100 k la buget in plus?                  
&gt;&gt;aici rebate-urile nu au legatura cu partea artistica a productiei ci cu faptul ca costurile de filmare depasesc potentialul profit. fara ele nu ar avea de munca nimeni din industrie. si filmul l-am filma in bulgaria cu echipa bulgara pe rebate-ul lor.        
&gt;&gt;care nu acopera nici o cincime din buget. deci. ce plmzici acolo?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Boss, nu stiu, mdlp si de sport, si de cinematografie, si de ce face statul cu banii (si daca m-ar durea, n-ar conta). Ce mi se pare nasoala e tenta asta de ipocrizie si ca incerci sa te scoti dintr-o situatie pe care si tu ai fi considerat-o jenibila daca nu erai implicat in ea.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;PiticiGratis 2.0: pai si unde e ipocrizie coaie? nu mi se pare normal sa iei bani de la stat sa faci filme, dar daca statul pierde exact ACEIASI BANI si cu si fara filmu meu, daca banii aia SE DAU ORICUM si nu ai cum SA OPRESTI ASTA, ce ar fi demn si neipocrit? sa ii lasi la altii?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;le-am luat banii de la gura altora cu alte proiecte de kkt coaie, ce e imoral la asta? vezi vreun documentar pe lista? vreun film bengos care sa merite bani? pai si atunci ce plmcomentezi?

In this case it does not make me wonder because he's lying about giving Shanann oxycodone and here's why...

In his actual letter he says this... **3) The reason the medical examiner found oxycodone in Shanann's system is because I gave it to her. I thought it would be easier to be with Nichol if Shanann wasn't pregnant.** 

We know that's not true. No oxy in any form was found in Shanann's system. Plain and simple. It's a lie.

And then there's this statement from Cadle... **Cadle asked him about the claims that Watts gave his wife Oxycodone and he responded with conflicting stories, saying he had given it to her twice – once at her parents' home in North Carolina to try to cause a miscarriage, and then immediately before her death. He later contradicted himself and said he only gave it to her once in North Carolina.** 

Notice that he's prompted by Cadle's question, he then lies and then realizes part of his lie is going to fail the sniff test.

[Desoxyn](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-9124/desoxyn-oral/details) is methamphetamine used to treat ADHD, Obesity and Narcolepsy

Xanax (zanny bars) and Valium are benzodiazepines which are used for anxiety and other mood disorders.

All these drugs are used safely thousands of times a day around the world both under the care of a physician and recreationally.

The crimialization of recreation use of these substances in the US has resulted in tainted products being consumed, and life destroying criminal records for thousands upon thousands of people nationwide.

The drugs themselves do not cause these issues, the criminalization and adulteration of them via clandestine sourcing most certainly does.

Methadone and suboxone are both opium-based derivatives that are supplied to addicts in the US as a form of replacement therapy. These people, as a whole, are consuming narcotics, prescribed by a physician, daily to maintain their habit. In the Netherlands and in Vancouver, Canada pharmaceutical grade heroin (diamorphone) is supplied to addicts to treat their treatment resistant addiction very successfully.

Those people are living their lives, paying their bills and taxes, going to work every day and raising their families.

The only thing criminalization does is destroy lives. Legalization and access to pure products of a known strength and supervised by a physician has been proven to work. This is not up for debate, it is being done today in sane and empathetic societies outside the US.",2

388,2019-10-02 23:52:06+00:00,"I am not at all condoning that your issue is real, but I remember seeing a study in the past (can’t remember what journal it was in) that showed that people who were on opioids were actually feeling phantom pains when on the medication. So, there was actually no pain, but when they would take the opioid , they would feel this phantom pain and want to take more. Then it’s just a viscous cycle. 

There are other pain medications other than opioids , and different forms of physical therapy are always an option. In my opinion, the opioid craze is to be blamed on a combination of the pharmaceutical companies, rouge doctors who prescribe them like they’re candy, and patients who are unwilling to try alternative options. The development of stronger and stronger opioids is out of control and is just feeding the addiction by providing that extra buzz to patients. I also put a lot of blame on doctors who only prescribe pain medications to patients. I used to work in a toxicology lab and there were some doctors that had staggering number of patients. This one, single doctor would “see” 50 patients per day. This means there was little no doctor to patient conversation about how the pain is progressing. It was simply a “are you still in pain?” “Yup” “here’s your prescription” type of meeting. Another doctor was a chiropractor who would just prescribe oxycodon to all of his patient!? Why treat back pain with such a powerful drug instead of trying other options.",1
389,2019-10-02 21:54:24+00:00,"See, there are folks that talk about him and NK possibly blowing up Cervi 319 and placing SW and the girls there to ""stage"" an explosion with them as the victims.  Now, I don't personally prescribe to this theory, and I know several that do.  Could be be true, could be, and I have no clue one way or another (do not know enough about the oil tank and the oil company to understand all the nuances that would go into a plan like that).

That being said, there were a lot of little things that caught my attention and brought me to the ""he planned it"" side.  Why was he and NK so adamant about erasing all of the cell phone messages and logs?  What were they discussing that was so ""bad"" if discovered?  Look, he wasn't the first guy to mess around on his spouse, and he certainly won't be the last (yes, I know women can be  just as bad).  

Now, we know that CW loves his father and is a lot closer to him than his mother, right?  The final week when he was in NC, remember that he spent a couple of days &amp; nights with his family, and the ""letter"" came out during that time frame (the ""if anything happens to me, my wife would have done it, but I won't do anything to her"" letter that his sister had).  If he was so worried about being ""killed"" by SW, why in the world go back to CO with her?  Now, I don't know what was said by his family during that week, considering how much they hated her, you can guess how bad it must have been (not even talking about Cindy Watts calling CWs close friends and complaining about SW over the years).

Then let's chat about when CW was driving SW and the girls to the restaurant at 80 + miles an hour, was he hoping for an accident?  Or how SW was fairly healthy throughout the pregnancy while in NC until that last week when CW joined them and all of a sudden, she's throwing up, nauseous, and dizzy?  We all know that he didn't want the new baby, he mentioned that.  On page 1769 of discovery, someone looked up “80 mg of Oxycodon \[sic\] will…” on CWs cell phone.  As SW was in NC with the girls, that left NK &amp; CW in CO to look it up before CW went to NC that last week.

Then the part where ""suddenly"", the video system I'm the house in CO ""doesn't work right"".  Check out SWs video about that, she was pretty upset about it (guess she suspected he was doing something or another).  If you're so checked out of the marriage as he's said many a time, why be concerned if the wife sees it if it's just NK at the house?  Or could it be that you are staging the house, or planning something else nefarious maybe?  No video to prove what happened that night (then parking the white SUV down the street for a few days...hmmm, so NK maybe can park in the garage or someone else?).  

We all know that when SW came home that early morning, she put her luggage by the staircase (as the original police video shows), and then after CW is in the house alone, that luggage is ""all of a sudden in the master bedroom""...who could have done that and why?  At that point, SW and the girls are already dead, why bother unless you're either looking for something or staging something?

Before CW went to NC, he also deleted his Facebook account to go ""invisible"" so none of NKs friends and family would find out about SW, Bella, CeCe, and Nico.  Why bother if NK and his family already knew, unless you are trying to ""wipe out your past"" and be a ""good guy"" in their eyes (we all know how hard he worked on being the good guy to everyone)?

Pressure, pressure, pressure from the girlfriend, his family, SW and the new baby, the girls getting older, and  for a guy that is not used to being in charge, under fire so to speak, the self made pressure must have been awful.  What happens when you see that you are being cornered slowly?  You plan on a way to get out.  CW maybe  a lot of things, but he can plan as he proved in high school with the right classes to get into that NASCAR school. 

These are just a few, there is so much more, small things that add up quickly.",1

403,2019-10-02 00:40:41+00:00,"I've got to rotate in a trauma ICU earlier this year as a student.  It's amazing all the constant resources involved in each patient.  Not only are the patients in a fancy bed and hooked up to a dozen different monitors and tubes (IVs, pulse ox, EKG, BP cuff, SCDs, IV antibiotics, keppra drip, usually some form of fenanyl or morphine on a PCA cassette device, high-flow O2, sometimes even a breathing machine if they're intubated, whatever else they need) but the nursing staff is constantly monitoring them 24/7 and performing neuro checks every hour to screen for potential emergent brain bleeds.  Then on top of the nursing staff and monitoring, you have 24/7 coverage by a resident team, day and night, on top of an on-call attending physician who is dual certified in Trauma surgery and ICU patient management available at every hour.  Every morning they have lab and blood work done and a new chest X-ray.  Then every day the entire trauma team of the attending physician, a team of residents, medical students, and their own dedicated pharmacist specifically for ICU patients rounds on every patient every morning, going over their vitals, lab work, test results, overnight notes, physical exam, and any recent updates and comes up with a detailed plan for every organ in that patient's body for the next 24-hours.  Rounding alone can take over 4 hours just to get through all the patients in the detail they need.  And all that is just standard baseline for each patient.  Trauma patients are enormously complex in that every organ system in the body needs to be stabilized and are often constantly fighting each other, so each patient needs specific meds, orders, and procedures to help stabilize them and get them off the ICU and onto the floor as quickly as possible, but that can often take days.  I saw one patient hooked up to a machine called ECMO which basically had to take the function of their lungs for over a week.

They tend to talk through my G.I. Tract and prefer a more gaseous bowels so to speak through the gurgling and other sounds.   

They also, after leaving the University of Wisconsin Madison and heading to speak on campus in Nebraska and Colorado, mutilated my anus like intensely really bad like I've never felt before in my life.  Was like the constipation signal was recorded from the one oxycodon experience or something, to the point I had to show my Dr. since I've never had hemorrhoids and I even went to the emergency room when I noticed some blood in the toilet when I first moved to Holland (Laketown Township actually... 4516 1/2 64th St.) back in 2001.  I didn't even have anything like hemorrhoids nor did I until after I was shot and even then not after off the oxycodons which was really only due to constipation and wasn't hemorrhoids.  

After my Dad passed... I started noticing the same issues he was having and from reviewing his medical images... they're mutilating me far more intensely.   Here is an image I made of the tongue artwork I call it... they were ordering me to stop drinking coffee (which I finally did and it did go away) and I didn't and twice this appeared:

I've kept the anus images private and hoping will heal up without surgery.",1
