# Dog enters in front of the owner to defend her from her knife wielding husband and is seriously injured: 'True hero', says police officer

*Police made 18 hours of pursuit and arrested the man in the rural area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCora√ß√£o de Jesus (MG). They also asked for help from the population and managed to save the life of 'Fofinho' , who was taken to a veterinary clinic, 72 km from where the fact occurred. He remains hospitalized.*

*by Michelly Oda, G1 Grande Minas, 2021-04-20*

A dog was seriously injured in defending its owner and her grandchildren. According to the Military Police \[not in the USA way, more like a gendarmerie\], the woman's husband was armed with a knife and threatened his family. After the dog's reaction, the man fled and was arrested on Tuesday (20) after more than 18 hours of uninterrupted searches.

The occurrence, registered in Cora√ß√£o de Jesus (MG), was initially attended by Corporal Valmintas Souza and Diego Garcia.

‚ÄúAt the moment when the perpetrator threatened the victim and his grandchildren, the dog went ahead with the instinct to defend them and ended up being stabbed four times. He was a true hero, we don't know other outcome this situation could have had‚Äù, says Corporal Souza.

Immediately after the assault, the police began searching for the man. In addition, the police realized that ""Fofinho"" \[fo-FEE-gno, 'gno' as in gnocchi, 'Fluffy' or 'Cute'\]   was seriously injured and needed urgent help.

‚ÄúIn our town, there is a single veterinarian who serves the entire region and travels a lot. We started to mobilize the population on social networks and soon we received many messages from people wanting to help ‚Äù, says the officer.

After the veterinarian Caio Santos Rabelo offered to take care of Fofinho, Corporal Souza and his wife, Renata Albuquerque, brought the dog to Montes Claros, 72 kilometers from Cora√ß√£o de Jesus. The couple also have a dog and three adopted cats.The vet says he learned about the story from a neighbor and explains that the animal might not have resisted if the rescue took a few more hours. Fofinho was with stool spills in his abdomen, which could cause an infection followed by death.

‚ÄúThe doggy came in with multiple injuries, two serious perforations, one at the chest level and the other at the abdomen‚Äù, explains the doctor, citing some of the injuries.

Fofinho underwent an exploratory laparotomy, in which cleaning and closing of the wounds in the abdomen were performed. The biggest challenge is to recover the locomotor capacity, affected by the injuries.

The dog remains hospitalized and should undergo examinations. He is being medicated with anti-inflammatories, antibiotics and painkillers. Discharge from the veterinary clinic should take about 10 days.

""It is very common for pet animals to take action in such situation, it is a natural behavior for them to try act defensively, hence many are guard dogs.""""This dog's story was moving because of the protective instinct he had, in an impulse to protect the owner, he ended up seriously injured. But the way people mobilized to help him shows that if each one contributes in his own way, everything can be much better. I am thankful for all people who expressed the desire to help ‚Äù, concludes Corporal Souza.

After the perp's arrest and Fofinho's rescue, Michael Stephan, commander of the 210th company PM, whose jurisdiction covers Cora√ß√£o de Jesus, says that the police sought to give a satisfactory outcome to the two situations found in the occurrence: domestic violence and animal protection.

‚ÄúWhen it comes to domestic violence, the Military Police are always trying to provide the most effective and efficient response possible, which is what was done by the military police. After being aware of this occurrence, they undertook tracking throughout the night and day until the arrest of the suspect. On the other hand, the Military Police acted as a bridge so other institutions came and provided support to this dog, who acted like a hero to help people who were attacked, and ended up being injured. ‚Äù

# 'Hero dog' who stabbed 4 times while defending the owner returns home: 'He arrived and went straight to her lap', says police officer when delivering dog

*Police officers retrieved 'Fofinho' in Montes Claros (MG) \[was in a vet clinic\] and took it to the owner, in Cora√ß√£o de Jesus (MG) \[rural area, 72km away\]. Dog stepped in front of the woman to defend her from her husband, who was armed with a knife. After realizing that the dog was seriously injured, Corporal Souza and Garcia campaigned to help him.*

*By Michelly Oda, G1 Grande Minas 2021-04-28*

""An exciting reunion"". This is how Cpl's Valmintas Souza and Diego Garcia define the moment when they delivered the dog Fofinho to its owner.

The dog was stabbed 4 times when entering in front of its guardian front to defend her from her husband in Cora√ß√£o Jesus (MG). After the pet's reaction, the man fled and was arrested after more than 18 hours of uninterrupted search.

‚ÄúOn the day of the incident, she stayed in her living room. As she has partial blindness, she was desperate to hear that the dog was injured. They told us about their relationship, but today we saw what it truly represents, he arrived and was already going to her lap. The dog defended her risking his own life‚Äù says Corporal Souza, who himself has three rescued pets: a dog and two cats.

As soon as they realized that the little animal was seriously injured, the military police mobilized to help him. They released the story on social media and a chain of solidarity was formed.

Upon hearing about Fofinho's story from a neighbor, veterinarian Caio Santos Rabelo offered to assist him in Montes Claros (MG). After the shift ended, Corporal Souza and his wife traveled 72 kilometers to take the puppy to the specialist. This Tuesday, he and his colleague Garcia took him home.

‚ÄúHe was very weak, very weak. Today, when we arrived at her residence, she hugged the doggy, who was walking again and then took a stroll in the yard. It was a great satisfaction, this is our mission ‚Äù, completes Cpl Garcia, who has three dogs at home.

On the day of the occurence, the veterinarian Caio Rabelo explained to G1 that the dog might not have resisted, if the rescue delayed a few more hours, as it had a spillaged of fecal matter in the abdomen, which could cause an infection followed by death.

‚ÄúThe puppy came in with multiple injuries, two of which were severe perforations, one at the level of the chest and the other at the abdomen,‚Äù he said, citing that the biggest challenge is the recovery of locomotor capacity, affected by the injuries.

Fofinho underwent an exploratory laparotomy, in which cleaning and closing of the wounds in the abdomen were performed. The doggy also underwent examinations and received medication.

‚ÄúWe saw how attached the dog is to the owner and how she also has a passion for him. Many people have expressed a desire to even adopt him, but the best place he can be for sure, is next to her ‚Äù, concludes Corporal Souza.",10

I had a good friend that was prescribed 400mg of seroquel per day as well as being an opiate addict. Our drug of choice was slamming morphine. Of course he complained of opiate withdrawal but when he his doctor retired, his seroquel prescription stopped in which he wasn't to concerned. That is until about four days pass and he's withdrawal is insatiable. Initially he thought it was due to opiates or lack thereof but after shooting a 60 mscontin himself with no relief he came to a discerning realization. He suffered from horrible sweats and cold chills, shaking, horrible anxiety and he described his nightmares as extremely disturbing. I'm just telling this as something to consider. Unfortunately, I can't tell you he got everything straightened out because he died in a freak accident a couple years ago.

What other drugs can get you off your ass for $3 a day and can be used for several decades before it kills you?

Most other drugs are either very expensive (heroin, coke) or a pain in the ass to buy (oxy, fentany, meth) or they kill you within a couple of short years.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

I declined it even though it was pretty sore, because i wanted it to be working at full strength for the carry up the beach and the ride to the hospital. 

So i was about 15-20min with no pain relief, then they gave me morphone and penthrox right there on the beach before going to the hospital.",1

Some who try for natural ultimately end up with an epidural to relax the muscles and let the baby come around 6-7cm. Some women lock up and that slows delivery. It's not ideal to get an epidural late but it beats getting fentynyl in an IV to help with the pain and then getting shots in the perenium to sew up any tears. 

Even still this is no risk for autism since autism develops as the baby does with no explanation as to why.",4

102,2021-04-25 21:10:38+00:00,"Do you think we'd have any conflict without the media? If they had reported that George Floyd was a criminal who overdosed on Fetanyl, instead of a black person murdered by police due to racism (and not even police brutality in general), then I don't think BLM would have rioted.

If they even called BLM rioters or terrorists (And I don't care which, I just want it to be somewhat consistent with the riots on the Capitol, so that the judgement is impartial), instead of encouraging them, I don't think it would have been half as bad.

Black feel oppressed because the media keeps telling them they are. White people hate the media, because they keep demonizing them and blaming them for the problems of black people (like with the recent crimes against Asians). Like this, the media pisses both sides off to get them to blame eachother.

White people don't dislike black people in general. Black people don't dislike white people in general. If there is any fight, it's in *values*, like culture. That can't be helped, just like political differences in values can't be helped.

&gt;It wasn't on its way out

That's not true. Racism exists because we consider ourselves different, not because we are. If the media made a big deal out of eye-color, we'd start thinking about that instead.

As a good example, when white people have visited black people in the past, we have been called ""gods"" and other such things, and even made friendships. In order to get conflict, you need a perceived difference in values which is destructive to the other, like the belief that black people want to breed out whites, or that islam will take over as the main religion, or that Christmas will be banned.

It's not other races in itself which triggers this natural defense, but the belief that this other race is out to replace you or that they represent savage values which are incompatible with your own moral beliefs.

The worst change on society is that the feeling of community and friendship and mutual trust is disappearing, migration made this way worse (but globalism had a hand, too). My parents left their keys in their door when they were kids, you could not do something like that today.

Whites and blacks (and even whites and whites, black and blacks) don't feel like they're on ""the same side"" anymore. They're no longer united, because the media has sown distrust and extreme ideas and the belief that everyone who disagrees with them is stupid or evil.",1

There was no fatal physical injuries inflicted on George Floyd's neck. There was infact no damage at all.

He died because he speedballed on fatal amounts of meth, cocaine, THC, 4-ANFF, and fetanyl. He didn't die because of the officer putting his knee on his back.

It goes back to what I said in my original comment. Smoking something makes it kick in a lot faster then insufflating. That's why crack only last 15 min when coke last 30 min. Hits you twice as fast and leaves twice as fast. Another example of this could be lemon tecking shrooms or snorting oxys. Oxycotin can give you a high orally but its diffrent when you get that rush from insufflating it. You will always reach the same peak but the rate at which it hits you will make you perceive it as much stronger or weaker.

You also might be able to smoke more at once then you could snort.",1

Okay, I have been at this for too long and I am feeling silly; the Œ≥-members are three 3-foot tall fem-cocks. Yin is white skinned with black hair &amp; blue eyes; Yang is black skinned with white hair &amp; red eyes; and Harmony is tan skinned with silver hair and violet eyes. Their personalities are drawn from their names and are expressions of my psyche. Yin is a child of the Enlightenment; rational, cunning, at times ruthless. Yang is the Romantic full of passions. Harmony, is the diplomat and peace maker. Buying a set of balls for each. Not sure the best place for the Œ≥-members, default would be around the groin, but maybe equidistance round the waist, or Yin &amp; Yang on the shoulders like a little angel and devil? I guess I‚Äôll go default but I‚Äôm open to suggestions.

137,2021-04-23 22:33:31+00:00,"Thanks for that. I never really got much relief from any morphine based ER products. Its funny since its seemed okay the couple times I had it through an IV after surgery, but MSContin, Kadian and Avinza were all real duds for me. Even IR oral morphine was very ineffective, regardless of dose. 

If I remember right (and its apparently a little hazy since it was so long ago), Avinza and Kadian were very similar with the little tiny plastic time release pills. That's a great advantage if you cant swallow capsules, I remember mixing both of them with applesauce. I'd imagine that feature makes them a bit resistant to dose dumping, since you can mix it with food, but where there is a will, abusers will find a way to make it dose dump.

Opioids/pain are weird. There's  bunch of different receptors, each drug hits each one differently, so I could see Norco having a better result at an equivalent dose, but I would think Zyhydro or Hysingla would stand a better chance that something morphine based. Its really weird, a lot of people seem to have a problem using morphine products, enough that I kept expecting to see some study on it, but that was before they stopped doing any opioid science that wasn't addiction related. Its a damn shame, since there was a great deal about methadone and its ability to cause remission in cases of chemo resistant leukemia.    

I know what you mean it seems buprenorphine is a one way trip. It may work for chronic pain for a short period, but within 6 months its as if pain becomes tolerant. It may work great for addiction or even ""pseudo-pain"" (there's pseudo-addiction, why not pseudo-pain) but true analgesia requires something else. I pretty much told my pain doc that I wasnt going to put any more money in Andrew Kolodny's wallet, and never to suggest buprenorphine to me again. Its just amazing they can say the exact same things about this drug as they prosecuted Perdue for saying about OxyContin and nobody gives a damn because its his drug. They have addicts and pain patients believing buprenorphine isnt an opioid. Maybe scam would be a better term for it, even though its not totally medically accurate....",1

I don‚Äôt think you can imagine the amount of pain the person suffers the last 4 weeks of dying from cancer. All the Ocycontin, liquid fentanyl (subsys), morphine, etc does so little to touch the pain. In fact, you reach the legal limit pretty quick. The doctors can‚Äôt give you enough to kill the pain because enough kills the patient. 

Trust me, I watched my father in hospice due a death you only see in nightmares. He would have done anything to die of opioid poisoning rather than the way he did die. In a fetal position, every nerve on fire, tears streaming down his face because his body would not die and the doctor told him he he got more pain killers it would kill him. I looked at him and the nurses like their were insane. 

Finally, 3 days of it and he finally died. Trust me, Red did Sam a huge favor. That‚Äôs the truth. Sam had a bleak future of pain and agony. I was so relieved when my father (and my mother) died. My mother died painlessly, my father died in horrible pain.

Ele afirmou que o protesto gerou ""grande progresso"", em refer√™ncia aos atos em seu favor e √† repercuss√£o internacional do caso.

 Segundo o opositor, em post no Instagram, ""os m√©dicos nos quais eu confio emitiram um comunicado dizendo que n√≥s alcan√ßamos o suficiente para que eu encerre minha greve de fome"". Na quinta (22), um grupo de m√©dicos apoiadores de Navalni afirmou que ele poderia morrer a qualquer minuto.

 √â incerto se ele recebeu, nesse per√≠odo, algum tipo de alimenta√ß√£o l√≠quida ou por veia.

 [Ele foi preso em um aeroporto de Moscou ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/01/opositor-de-putin-volta-a-russia-e-e-preso-no-aeroporto-em-moscou.shtml)no dia 17 de janeiro, quando voltava de 150 dias de tratamento m√©dico na Alemanha ‚Äîele [fora envenenado na Sib√©ria, em agosto de 2020, ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/aliados-tentam-tirar-opositor-de-putin-em-coma-apos-suposto-envenenamento-da-russia.shtml)pelo que cientistas disseram ser o agente neurot√≥xico de origem sovi√©tica Novitchok.

  Navalni, seus apoiadores e at√© o governo de Joe Biden, [que chamou o presidente Vladimir Putin de assassino](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/03/biden-ataca-putin-de-olho-na-china-mas-tom-agressivo-traz-riscos.shtml), acusam o FSB (servi√ßo secreto russo) pelo ataque. O Kremlin nega.

 A pris√£o foi determinada por uma tecnicalidade, o fato de o ativista em coma em Berlim n√£o ter batido ponto com seu oficial de condicional. Ele cumpria uma senten√ßa suspensa, fruto de uma condena√ß√£o por fraude considerada pela Corte Europeia de Direitos Humanos forjada.

 Em fevereiro, [foi julgado e mandado para cumprir o restante da pena](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/01/opositor-navalni-pode-pegar-35-anos-de-cadeia-e-convoca-protesto-contra-putin.shtml), dois anos e meio, numa col√¥nia penal a 100 km de Moscou. Sem acesso regular a advogados e m√©dicos, come√ßou a greve de fome.

 Na semana passada, 15 kg mais magro e com sinais vitais falhando, Navalni foi internado em um hospital em Moscou. Segue sem ser atendido por m√©dicos de sua confian√ßa. ‚ÄúN√£o retiro minha demanda de ver um m√©dico relevante. Estou perdendo a sensibilidade em partes dos meus bra√ßos e pernas, n√£o entendo o que √© isso e quero ser tratado"", escreveu.

 Ele comemorou, contudo, o fato de ter sido examinado duas vezes por um time de m√©dicos civis, n√£o do sistema prisional. ""Dois meses atr√°s, estavam rindo dos meus pedidos de ajuda.""

 [Navalni √© uma crescente dor de cabe√ßa para Putin](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/igorgielow/2018/06/um-espectro-chamado-navalni-o-heroi-da-vez.shtml) e virou pe√ßa no jogo de press√µes entre o Kremlin e o Ocidente patrocinado por Biden, que recrudesceu a ret√≥rica contra o l√≠der russo ap√≥s anos de complac√™ncia de Donald Trump ‚Äîatribu√≠da ora √† incompet√™ncia, ora √† suposta ajuda virtual que teve de hackers russos em sua elei√ß√£o em 2016.

 O fim da greve de fome de Navalni ocorre, curiosamente, no mesmo dia em que os russos [disseram ter iniciado a sa√≠da de suas tropas de exerc√≠cios ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/04/russia-anuncia-retirada-de-tropas-das-fronteiras-com-a-ucrania.shtml)perto das fronteiras da Ucr√¢nia, que geraram grande tens√£o com os EUA e a Otan (alian√ßa militar ocidental). Como personagem pol√≠tico, a densidade eleitoral de Navalni √© quase nula, nunca tendo sa√≠do do tra√ßo em pesquisas independentes.

 Mas seus v√≠deos com den√∫ncias, de qualidade jornal√≠stica duvidosa mas bastante efetivos na forma, s√£o amplamente vistos e tocam na desconfian√ßa b√°sica da classe m√©dia russa ante seus governantes.

 O ativista ampliou seu escopo de atividade mirando o partido de sustenta√ß√£o do Kremlin, o R√∫ssia Unida. [Promove campanhas em favor de quaisquer candidatos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/09/eleicao-na-russia-traz-vitoria-e-alerta-para-o-pressionado-putin.shtml) que se oponham √† sigla e teve sucessos pontuais.

 Foi na prepara√ß√£o de uma elei√ß√£o local em Tomsk que ele foi envenenado. O grande desafio ser√° a elei√ß√£o parlamentar de setembro, na qual o R√∫ssia Unida apresenta baixa aprova√ß√£o em pesquisas. Isso √© um dos fatores que ensejou a campanha judicial, num pa√≠s em que este Poder √© alinhado ao Executivo, contra Navalni. √â not√°vel de sua influ√™ncia tamb√©m que milhares tenham se disposto a ir √†s ruas em seu favor:

 Quando atos n√£o s√£o autorizados, como era o caso na quarta, a pol√≠cia pode prender quem quiser.

 Enquanto isso, cresce o cerco interno √† m√≠dia independente, que mingua e se esconde em cantos da internet na R√∫ssia ‚Äîh√° poucos grandes jornais, sempre lidando com a press√£o do Kremlin, e [praticamente toda a TV √© estatal ou alinhada ao governo.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/mundo/ft0112200719.htm) Nesta sexta, o Roskomnadzor, √≥rg√£o regular de m√≠dia russo, classificou [o site Meduza](https://meduza.io) como ""agente estrangeiro"", o que √© quase uma pena de morte para o neg√≥cio.

 Uma lei de 2012, feita na esteira de grandes protestos contra a nova elei√ß√£o de Putin, mirou ONGs, indiv√≠duos e √≥rg√£os de m√≠dia que tenham financiamento externo. Eles podem operar, mas s√£o sujeitos a inspe√ß√µes financeiras draconianas. O Meduza √© baseado na Let√¥nia, para onde sua fundadora, Galina Timtchenko, fugiu em 2014 com medo da repress√£o russa. Com reportagens investigativas e artigos de opini√£o contr√°rios ao regime, o site tem grande capilaridade, com colaboradores espalhados pela R√∫ssia.

 Agora, essas pessoas podem sofrer achaques legais. No come√ßo do ano, a tradicional R√°dio Europa Livre, americana, foi tachada de agente estrangeiro e agora enfrenta um processo que pode resultar em US$ 150 mil em multas, inviabilizando sua opera√ß√£o na R√∫ssia.",1

Last time I checked, murder was still murder, no matter how easy or hard it was to execute. I mean Jesus...You could have a guy over 100, on his deathbed, with a few short hours to live....If someone was caught strangling him and helped him meet his maker before the naturally appointed time...It would still be murder. And since when is a medical condition a justification for a cop killing someone? Floyd had vasculitis supposedly...but how many Americans have plaque on their arteries, high cholesterol or heart disease? Including Americans who happen to be cops? Should doctors start telling their patients to get their cholesterol and BP down stat, because they never know when they might need prime health to survive a cop chokehold or chest compression? What if Floyd had had asthma or type 1 diabetes? As a cop, you don't get a look at someone's medical history when you stop them...but you shouldn't have to to exercise restraint and diplomacy.  And you sure as shit don't get to use the, ""I didn't know"" defense, when someone says they can't breathe and you remain crouched on top of them. 

Chauvin trying to argue that Floyd died because of an overdose of fetanyl or other drugs is that much more revolting and nonsensical....because if Floyd had truly had an overdose level of those drugs, he wouldn't have needed to be subdued period. He would have been barely conscious, if at all and represent zero threat...If Floyd was truly that intoxicated, than to me what you've got is a clear cut case for first degree murder. I don't think Floyd actually had an overdose level of drugs in his system, and of course we all know that Chauvin mentioned the drugs to paint Floyd as a criminal and try to hold sway with the jury and public opinion...but justice is justice. It is not a respecter of persons. It does not require than anyone be anybody, or do anything to receive it. It is an intrinsically, priceless ideal. When people start trying to limit who can or can't receive justice based on what the  the victim is or isn't and not what happened to them, it's not justice anymore.",1
162,2021-04-22 22:00:39+00:00," O esfor√ßo de Jair Bolsonaro para transmitir ao l√≠der dos EUA, Joe Biden, uma imagem de compromisso no combate √† destrui√ß√£o da floresta amaz√¥nica n√£o se resumiu apenas √† ado√ß√£o de um [discurso conciliador.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/04/leia-a-integra-do-discurso-de-bolsonaro-na-cupula-do-clima-com-checagens-e-contextualizacao.shtml)

 [Em participa√ß√£o na C√∫pula do Clima](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/04/eua-dizem-que-bolsonaro-foi-construtivo-mas-credibilidade-se-apoiara-em-planos-solidos.shtml), nesta quinta-feira (22), o presidente usou uma gravata verde, cor associada ao meio ambiente, e, na lapela esquerda do terno preto, ao lado de uma representa√ß√£o da bandeira nacional, pendurou um broche vermelho e azul.

 O adorno √© uma representa√ß√£o da [Medalha do Pacificador com Palma](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/em-meio-a-bloqueios-de-recursos-governo-gasta-r-16-mi-com-medalhas.shtml), uma honraria concedida a militares e civis que tenham se destacado, em tempos de paz, por epis√≥dios de bravura e altru√≠smo. De acordo com assessores palacianos, a utiliza√ß√£o do s√≠mbolo n√£o foi por acaso.

 A inten√ß√£o do presidente era a de transmitir uma imagem de sacrif√≠cio pessoal e de coragem ilimitada, em uma tentativa de rebater cr√≠ticas de que a atual gest√£o n√£o se esfor√ßa para reduzir o desmatamento.

 [Segundo o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2021/04/desmatamento-da-amazonia-em-marco-bate-recorde-e-e-o-maior-dos-ultimos-seis-anos.shtml) Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, por√©m, o desmate da floresta amaz√¥nica voltou a crescer em mar√ßo e bateu o recorde para o m√™s. Foram 367,61 km¬≤ de desmatamento, ultrapassando o recorde anterior, de 2018, com 356,6 km¬≤ destru√≠dos, seguido por 2020, com 326,49 km¬≤ derrubados.

  A Medalha do Pacificador foi recebida por Bolsonaro em 2018, ap√≥s ele ter sido eleito. O presidente recebeu a honraria do ent√£o comandante do Ex√©rcito, Eduardo Villas B√¥as, por ter impedido que um soldado se afogasse durante uma instru√ß√£o militar, em 1978.

 Bolsonaro j√° disse que o pa√≠s [deveria classificar como her√≥i o coronel Carlos Alberto Brilhante ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml)[Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml), um dos principais [s√≠mbolos da repress√£o durante a ditadura militar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/ustra-era-um-monstro-que-me-torturava-com-choque-e-ria-diz-vitima-de-militar.shtml), por ele ter recebido, em 1972, a Medalha do Pacificador com Palma. ""Sou capit√£o do Ex√©rcito, conhecia e era amigo do coronel, sou amigo da vi√∫va. [...] O coronel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra recebeu a mais alta comenda do Ex√©rcito, a Medalha do Pacificador, √© um her√≥i brasileiro"", afirmou em 2016.

 Segundo o [relat√≥rio final da Comiss√£o Nacional da Verdade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/12/1560369-acesse-a-integra-do-relatorio-final-da-comissao-nacional-da-verdade.shtml), apenas na gest√£o de Ustra o DOI-Codi (Destacamento de Opera√ß√µes de Informa√ß√µes) do 2¬∫ Ex√©rcito (SP) foi o respons√°vel pela morte ou pelo desaparecimento de ao menos 45 presos pol√≠ticos.

 N√£o √© a primeira vez neste ano que Bolsonaro exibe a honraria militar para tentar demonstrar sacrif√≠cio. Ele tamb√©m utilizou o broche em refer√™ncia √† medalha em mar√ßo, durante pronunciamento em cadeia nacional no qual tamb√©m [moderou o discurso em rela√ß√£o √† pandemia do coronav√≠rus.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/03/em-pronunciamento-bolsonaro-mente-sobre-acoes-do-governo-na-pandemia-e-agora-diz-que-2021-sera-o-ano-da-vacinacao.shtml)

 A utiliza√ß√£o de acess√≥rios para tentar defender bandeiras e pregar ideologias √© um h√°bito recorrente do atual governo. Os artefatos v√£o desde uma pulseira evang√©lica, num esfor√ßo para salientar a [alian√ßa ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/bolsonaro-intensifica-contato-com-evangelicos-para-conter-queda-de-popularidade.shtml)do governo com a denomina√ß√£o religiosa, at√© uma gravata com estampa de fuzis, refer√™ncia √† [defesa da flexibiliza√ß√£o do porte de armas no pa√≠s.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/06/eduardo-bolsonaro-faz-visita-a-novo-diretor-geral-da-pf-e-fala-sobre-armas-bandeira-do-governo.shtml)

 Uma das pe√ßas causou pol√™mica no ano passado, n√£o exatamente pelo seu significado, mas por sua imagem n√£o ser apropriada para o momento em que o pa√≠s enfrenta a pandemia do coronav√≠rus.

 Em entrevista coletiva para explicar a metodologia para chegar ao n√∫mero de √≥bitos pela Covid-19, o ent√£o secret√°rio-executivo do Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de, Elcio Franco Filho, [adornava o palet√≥ com um broche de um cr√¢nio perfurado por uma faca](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/numero-2-da-saude-traz-faca-na-caveira-para-entrevistas-coletivas.shtml). O apetrecho faz refer√™ncia √† carreira do coronel da reserva, que integrou as for√ßas especiais do Ex√©rcito, unidades que usam a imagem da caveira como s√≠mbolo.

 O artefato, reconhecem auxiliares presidenciais, n√£o era o mais adequado para a ocasi√£o.

 No ano passado, ap√≥s ter pregado em reuni√£o ministerial [que a popula√ß√£o deveria se armar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/05/frase-de-bolsonaro-sobre-dar-armas-para-populacao-e-rejeitada-por-72.shtml), Bolsonaro apareceu em p√∫blico com uma gravata com estampas de fuzis.

 Also, of course the prosecutions witnesses are going to say that  he was killed.

Heart conditions, fentanyal levels through the roof, meth, and then add onto that a strugle and the adrenaline from the arrest and you can see why he died. 

Like i said before i dont condone Chauvins actions, he didnt follow SOP, but I dont think that he was the reason floyd died, if he did an approved hold im fairly ceertain floyd would have died regardless. Maybe he could have helped floyd more, i wish after floyd stoped resisting he would have checked on him medically, but hindsight is 20/20 and thats still not anywhere near murder.",1

Sounds like the meth level was low enough that no one really tried to say that it was enough to cause his death, given his death was from lack of oxygen.  Both too low, and didn't line up medically with how u would die if it was high.

The fetanyl thing - reasonable doubt is the bar in a trial, right?  So if most people with that level of fetanyl do not die, you have to have a reasonable suspicion that it was more likely he died of that than the knee holding him down by the neck.  You 'can' die of a nicotine overdose, but the level would be high enough in your blood stream that others would have died too.  No one suggests he died of the nicotine in his blood, and they brought the experts in to show that the level was below the level for fetanyl that you could reasonably think he would have died from it.

Obviously we weren't there to hear the arguments made, and can only get articles.  But from what I read, it would be a fantastic coincidence if he happened to die at a lower level than most overdoses while being held down by his neck.  A fantastic coincidence  is beyond the reasonable doubt threshold.",1
202,2021-04-21 21:31:47+00:00,Maybe.  But Floyd also could have not ingested over 3X the amount of Fentany to kill someone along with Meth and other drugs while he had COVID which makes it hard to breath and then also resisted arrest for 20+minutes.

This article explains how his levels were definitely not lethal for meth or fetanyl. 

Notably, the fetanyl was about the average level of a person in a DUI where fetanyl was present.  That's a large group of ppl who did not die.  We don't have good data on what the level of fetanyl that is fatal, because it's not generally tested for.  So when the state takes blood from ppl for things like DUIs, we get a snapshot of 'normal' usage levels.  

Also, one thing that is known of opoids, is you dont struggle to breathe when opoids are slowing your breathing significantly, which is why u die from it.  The 'pain' of suffocating is reduced and your body doesn't realize what's happening, and u don't breathe enough. George was obviously yelling about not being able to breathe, the opposite of what someone on too much fetanyl would do.",1

227,2021-04-21 14:13:01+00:00,"The reason that the officers who killed Breanna Taylor were found not responsible, like many of these high profile cases, is that the media peddles the facts to back up the narrative rather than to accurately report on the events of the story.  
Breanna Taylor was deeply involved with Jamarcus Glover, who had been distributing crack cocaine and fentatyl. She had bailed him out of jail, drove him to drug houses to deliver drugs and pick up money, and allowed him to use her address for mail, bills, jail booking, and banking.  This is how the police became aware of her address, and used it for the raid.  
When the police executed the raid, her boyfriend opened fire on the police and the police returned fire, killing Breanna.  She was standing in the hallway when she was killed, not laying in bed as the media reported.    
Unfamilar with these elements of the story?  That is because they run contrary to the narrative that the media promoted, which is that the police ""arrived at the wrong address and shot her while she was in bed"".

I make this guess based off of the toxicologist saying that the majority of people who overdose have very little to no norfentanyl because they die before the fentanyl breaks down. So if there is any fentanyl at all, it‚Äôs probably a very small amount. 

So for the coroner to rule out drug overdose as a cause of death, he must‚Äôve had a sizeable amount of norfentanyl in his body. So if he did overdose, it sounds like it would have been a 1 in a half billion case. My own personal logic here says that even if there is a .000001% chance he overdosed, the overwhelming odds say he was choked to death as that is what was happening to him in his final moments.",1

*The reason he was held down that long was because they were waiting for paramedics to address the trouble breathing.

The reason the paramedics took 9 minutes was because they were not allowed to come, as it was not safe.

The reason it was not safe was because an unruly crowd started to gather and scream at the cops.  It is department policy that paramedics may not enter until the scene has been secured.

My surgical curtain had a Velcro window flap looking toward my belly. As the #1 rule is don't look past the curtain, I was shocked when the doc asked me if I wanted to lift that flap and see them pull out the baby! I yelled dear lord no! And shut my eyes! Husband looked, he regretted it lol. 

I got all my numbing meds while in the OR. The first drug made me numb, but dropped my blood pressure, so I was freezing and dizzy. The stuff to raise my blood pressure made me super nauseous and being trapped on my back during that feeling was terrifying. They gave me meds to fight the nausea. I lost track after that lol. So many meds.

Lastly, they doped me up with morphene and sent me back to my first waiting room. The nurse covered me with 10 pounds of hot cozy blankets and that was fucking heaven! When they wheeled my baby in I was high as crap. The nurse asked me if I wanted to hold her. My arms were trapped under the blankets of bliss, so she shoved my new baby down the front of my hospital gown. My favorite pic of me ever is this moment.

so hearing about your best friend's death really also hits home like what would i do if, God forbid, he passed, and we werent hanging simply because i still wanted to do dope? i would be absolutely broken and devastated and done. 

with that in mind, lemme ask you, and i genuinely mean no judgement/shade/offense by this question: if you were doing dope, and stopping would advert the car accident, would you? not would you in theory, cause obviously yes, but would you if you werent sure/if you really had to even if you were sure/if this was actually the situation right now, right here? would you be able to do it? i am just asking, cause my own answer is so much shakier than i care to admit.

I think most ppl have expressed what I was going to say about addiction, but I'll reiterate. For me personally, my reason for living, in addiction mode, is heroin. If I didn't have it my world would never quite seem complete. I could smile at birthday parties, get momentarily caught up in a book, perhaps even spend a week living like a 'normal' person. But it's always somewhere in the back of my mind, give it enough time and the urge will be over powering. I've actually been like this since childhood, until I found my drug of choice there was always something missing..

Anyway, when I first started dabbling as a choatic alcoholic I used to worry that my heroin was laced with fent and I'd OD, leaving behind the ppl I love. Within a month or two I was desperate FOR
it to be laced with fentayl, so id get a better high. 

The drug brings meaning and pleasure to my life, in way nothing else can, even the most amazing ppl who I love. I've taken risks I never thought I would all because of the love of the drug. I've risked everything, and continue to do so everyday, because the power it has over me is so strong. It makes me happy, so if I OD'd I'd die happy. I worry about having to die clean more than dying from a laced drug.

The only thing that I can compare it to is being in love, that overpowering, unhealthy, obsessive kind of love, where you would quite literally die for another person. 

I know I'm risking my life, but I have no choice. As other people have said, if I wanted a bag, and there was a 50:50 chance it would kill me, id still take it. Probably even if the odds where much higher....",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

White people die more by police per year, and they are the majority of the people incarcerated, and rightfully so. You do the crime, you do the time, whatever color you are. So you can take your ""white privilege"" and shove it up your ass. 


Light killed hardcore criminals, not people who smoke weed. Alot of people he killed were people on death row anyways, so smoking crack or weed, by itself, doesn put you on death row, nor would Light kill those people.

Secondly, people who deal hardcore drugs bare some responsibility for the lives ruined or killed by those drugs. Selling crack, coke, heroin, meth, fentonyl, all lead to overdoses or people dying or becuase they were under influence of said drugs. 

I agree with most of what else you said, Light was wrong, but it wasnt simple. Having the power to prevent innocent lives dying, while also assuring people worse than Light dont get the death note is no black and white thing to do. Look at the business men. They were killing their competitors, not just criminals. They killed fckin competitors for money. 

Light was far from the worst person tht couldve recieved it, and him turning it in opens the potential for the Japanese government to use it to kill all other leaders of other countries and take over the world. Its the corrupting nature of the death note tht is the problem, not just Lights god complex.

The suggestions as to what tzaraath actually is run the gamut,  including  including psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, favid, dermatophyte infections, nummular dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, crusted scabies, syphilis, impetigo, sycosis barbae, alopecia areata, boil, scabies, lichen simplex chronicus, scarlet fever, lupus erythematosus, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, folliculitis decalvans, morphea, sarcoidosis, and lichen planopilaris (per wiki). So ""leprosy"" doesn't really cut it.

As far as where the idea ""comes from,"" like all commandments in the Torah, it's part of the laws revealed at Sinai.

Just speaking from my personal perspective, if you study chapters 13-14 in Leviticus, you see that all the rituals of inspection by the priest and purification have one goal -- to return the afflicted person to a state of ""purity"" so that he or she can return to the general population as a full member of the Jewish community. Remember that in the ancient world such people were feared and cast out (hence ""leper colonies""). By contrast, the Torah looks forward to their return to the community, and tells us how to do it.

374,2021-04-17 19:10:54+00:00,"It took me a very long time to find acceptance for this new life. I went out kicking and screaming. The thing is...the more you think about your pain, the more you suffer. 

I noticed when I was doing something other than focusing on my pain, the less pain I feel. Not that this happens all the time or frequently but it‚Äôs something I noticed for me so I try if at all possible to focus my brain on anything else. Obviously there are times I can‚Äôt do this at all.

For me, and me only I say, I realized after a long time my pain was going to be part of my life and nothing would change that. Nothing would take me back to that previous life.

This was my acceptance and my pain has definitely improved after that. It improved from being off the charts and not wanting to live to having breaks of pain...periods where I actually didn‚Äôt have much pain which made the bad days tolerable because I knew if I did whatever I needed at the time (sometimes this means not moving at all) I would get a break later.

This only came about after I got proper pain medications to control my pain.

I know I‚Äôll be taking pain medication as long as I live. Why suffer is how I feel. I‚Äôve suffered more than enough.

Nothing helped until surgery but as you read more about spinal fusions you no doubt read horror stories.

I think a lot of people expect to be out of pain after a fusion which is rare but I‚Äôve known people who are doing pretty good now after their fusions.

I think if one is expecting a good improvement that‚Äôs a real expectation but if you‚Äôre expecting to be out of pain I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs unrealistic.

I had to fight my insurance company for years to be approved for my fusion. I have zero regrets. It‚Äôs given me much of my life back. I still struggle with pain but it‚Äôs nowhere near before. I only wish I had done mine years sooner.

Find the best surgeon in your insurance provider. Forgot about a bedside manner. You want someone who‚Äôs the best surgeon.

Why are you thinking fusion instead of a disc replacement? I was not a candidate for a disc replacement but the surgery has so much better outcomes. That‚Äôs what I would have done had I not specifically needed a fusion due to my condition. The recovery is so so much easier and the results much better.

I‚Äôm just going to throw something out there I‚Äôd highly suggest you should explore before a fusion. It‚Äôs called a Quell machine. It‚Äôs nothing like a Tens machine. I had one and it was freaking amazing for me. It‚Äôs this tiny machine you wear on your leg. It blocks pain signals. I‚Äôd be wearing one now except I developed a somewhat rare skin allergy to the electrodes. You can buy it and try it for six weeks and return it if it doesn‚Äôt work for you. When I was using mine I was pretty much able to get off opioids which I never thought I would do. Go online to check them out. I mean if you‚Äôre ready to have a fusion what do you have to lose.

I never ever regret my decision to have a fusion. My back pain now is minimal but I wound up with a serious case of sciatica which I never had before surgery. That‚Äôs another thing...you don‚Äôt always know what you‚Äôll wind up with after a fusion. Sciatica is the Pitts but compared to what a chemically sensitive disc is it‚Äôs still better. The decision as you know to have a fusion as you know is a big one. You can wind up with scar tissue issues and such after a fusion. It‚Äôs all about making a decision based on ALL the facts and having no other options.

I hope you can try the Quell machine. What have you got to lose? Go in to the surgeon with tons of questions. Try going onto spinal fusion boards everywhere like Facebook or the good old ones like spine.org talk to people and more. I‚Äôm more than happy to share more if you want to pm.

I have no regrets at all. I had suffered for over a decade and had zero quality of life. I had no hope for life. I had tried every pain killer known to man. I‚Äôve been on Morphene...you name it..it didn‚Äôt work.

If you do it just be ready with all your questions for the surgeon. Ask about what‚Äôs involved in the recovery and do talk to as many people with a similar diagnosis as your own. 

I regret nothing about my fusion. One of my better decisions in my life!",3

429,2021-04-15 13:09:20+00:00,"While true I mean how long have drugs been illegal. While some are grown. Some are not so easy to manufacture prescription drugs pcp fetanyl meth require full labs and a very wide knowledge. Even grown ones like weed or cocaine have things like high labor or energy water requirements to make it not quite so simple to hide. 

YET around 10% of population has access to and currently uses these illicit drugs. And over half of the adult population has at least tried them. 

While you can argue well its other states keep our rates high. Fact is where there is a market there is a seller. Whether its post warzone guns left over soviet surplus or manufacturing themselves. I do not see it ever being a difficult thing. Multi billion dollar criminal organizations that manufacturer and arrange thefts of prescription drugs and setup international drug trade routes manufacturer electronics and knockoff merchandise. Do you really think its just a matter of getting rid of guns that currently exist in private hands. 

Moreover it doesn't address fact sure maybe they have still have access all because evil unregulated states. BUT WHY is it higher why I mean its at least somewhat harder right. Shouldn't that at very least reflect by a slightly lower homicide rate rather than being significantly higher.",1

438,2021-04-15 05:51:07+00:00,"I have a number of strains of kratom, and I typically mix them all together in order to get more of the alkaloids.  


I have two different white kinds right now, I'm on 55mg of methadone once a day.  


My dose doesn't hold all the way through, sometimes I take 5.5 g- 7 g of kratom. I load it up into 00 capsules. I do this because my methadone dose doesn't hold the full 24 hours.   


Personally, I have never noticed the white kratom's to have a stimulant effect. Then again, I've only ever used kratom while a.) on hydromorphone daily. Sometimes I would take the kratom first thing in the morning and start using the hydro a few hours into my day,  sometimes I would just take the kratom in-between doses . Perhaps it's cause I was using hydro-morphone daily, but I never noticed a stimulant effect. ( my brother on the other hand refuses to use the white because he fiinds it too stimulating )  also, when on hydrmorphone when I would take green/red kratom I would get extremely tired (meaning I would notice the kratom still)  


b.) on methadone.   


So I've never used kratom off of opiates.  


I have a couple bags of kratom and I \*was\* using it in the evenings before going to sleep in order to try and help my sleep because I was waking up with insomnia because my methadone dose doesn't hold me 100%  


i would say that I did feel some effect of the kratom but more so I think it treated the withdrawls I was in and I would agree that it's very unlikely that you'll feel anything.   


with methadone usually you need an INSANE amount of opiate to break through. Like, when I first started taking methadone the DR said that I could keep using for the first couple weeks until I got my dose settled out... so i did.. I kept using hydromorphone.. and I had to use SO MUCH to have ...like barely an effect.  


To be honest, unless you haven't purchased it yet... there's no harm in trying.  


OH EXCEPT that before I started using capsules with the kratom... specifically with methadone.... I would start dry-heave vomiting in way that you NEVER want to experience.  


I was waking up in methadone withdrawal at like 5-6 am and so I tried drinking some kratom that I had prepared by my bedside the night before and it was the worst decision I ever made. because i started vomiting and dry heaving for like .... too long.  


I then decided I would try using capsules... and i'd throw kratom into 10 capsules it was always between 4.5 grams and 7 grams of kratom but i didn't like taking less than 5.5 grams.  


I was specifically using this to overcome the methadone withdrawl.   
NOTE : I was taking methadone everyday, 55 mg, and I still am... this has never changed. I don't miss my dose or anything , my body just doesn't hold the methadone very well.  


I did deecide to stop doing this a while back and save my kratom for when I choose to get off off methadone (a slow taper)  


If you already have the kratom the only risk in trying it is the risk of vomiting.

I actually think it's really solid, and I'm quite proud of how I've refined it. I feel like it can reasonably answer to any comp design. The basic idea is to reduce 2 of their heroes to 25%ish health, then move jester up. They can usually only save 1 of them, so Jester gets a finale kill. From there it's maintaining the lead with heals, stuns, and DMG to kill them off one by one. Sidenote, Flag is hilariously difficult to deathblow which is both amusing and really really useful if they decide to try kill him early. A lot of the time they attempt, fail continuously, and give up.

- MAA screaming? Arb can remove debuffs. Else, use DOTS
- HM &amp; Antiq AOE spam? Abom riposte, Flag benefits 
- Hard DMG? Abom stuns and/or goes beast mode for hard DMG, Flag burst heals, Arb secondary heal if need be
- DOTS? Usually falls under HM &amp; Antiq spam. Otherwise, Flag can transfer DOTS to himself to then burst heal/burst DMG
- Mark party? Flag transfers marks to himself. This surprisingly nearly always just completely ruins their plans

I do succumb to stress comps sometimes. I feel that if I had made more optimal decisions, I could usually kill them quicker than they stress me to heart attack. Sometimes I even afflict them via abom and flag, but this is just a nice little bonus that is always coincidental. 

In general, having both Jester and Flag makes for a real mind-fucky game for my opponent, IMO. I sure as hell wouldn't wanna vs that.",1

Take cocaine for example. My buddy would bring back the most amazing scale cocaine from Miami once a month, and i would take a few lines on a friday night.

Alcohol is probably the only thing ive ever had an ""issue"" with, but this is more of a caloric chase. I can turn down alcohol no problem, but once ive had one drink its all i want. My body knows its ez calories. 

Ive tried so many other drugs too back in college days. Heroin (smoked) meth (snorted, extremely addictive substance...), bottles of oxycotin that i would just keep in my drawer and take on a rainy day..never had an issue. 

At some point i might go in for genetic testing if i hear about it so they can study me.

I recently joined a group chat on Discord and decided to join a voice chat with a couple of people. It was pretty quiet, a guy had just shared his video of his dog and then after a minute everyone was muted. I decided show of my plant and be like ""I don't have my dog here, but here's plant"", but just as a I turned on the video Driver yelled at me (our deuteragonist).

Driver said ""Whoever has their video on can you not, I'm driving?"" so I immediately turned it off, and then she said ""Who is fentanyl?"" For context my nickname is Fenton, and in different servers I use different puns on it, and my go to is usually Fentanyl.

To paraphrase...
D: Why is your name Fentonyl?
Me: Oh, it's a pun on Fenton and the drug.
D: Why is it that when there's an opoid crisis with people dying in America? 
M: Sorry
D: That's horrible
M: I've changed it to Fentonol, a fake alcohol
D: *exasperated* Thank you

Then she went on with her driving and I just stayed quiet for a minute before leaving the call. For extra context I'm not American opioids aren't really a thing here (or else they're just a non issue). I have considered before that it might be offensive but I rationalised that someone named Kane could have Kokane as their name and it wouldn't be an issue, or other nicknames like Crystal Moth, so I thought Fentonyl would fall under the same category.

I'm feeling kinda shitty about it and ashamed to show my face there again, so let me know if I should be feeling this way or if it's blown out of proportion.

And one on his neck by the tailpipe of the cruiser. Chauvin‚Äôs foot was off the ground. Resisting or not they had a duty to put him on his side. In the hospital they treat the patient.

461,2021-04-14 05:58:22+00:00,"Absolutely love everything you've said. I'm in Canada, and ya I remember when dope wasn't fentanyl. For me it just seems like the last 3-5 years things have REALLY CHANGED!!!!!!! really around 3.5 years ago or something like that. 

Technically, in 2015 the fentanyl was starting to be a problem. an' I remember in 2012 getting some ""China White"" that was supposedly fent, but I do remember a time when i considered my logic and knowledge to be able to be proactive in ""Staying safe' on the street. I used to keep in mind all the FACTS I knew about whatever substance I was using, and I would dose accordingly and do my best to be ""safe"" and that idea of being safe is COMPLETELY GONE now. I keep saying ""The street's not safe, The street's not safe"" and yeah even at that, using heroin still seemed very dangerous and scary.. but now how things are there's absolutely on safety at all. My Dad died of fake oxycontin pills in 2015. He was clean for a couple years and he was working out west and he has a back problem, he told me he was gonnna get some oxy specifically for the day's his back would go out that way he wouldn't have to call in sick for 2 weeks in a row and lose his job. CRAZIEST thing happened that NONE Of us saw coming. He bought fake oxy's off the street, unknowingly, and died of acute fentantyl toxicity. These fake oxy 80's had fentanyl and xylazine in it. Xylazine is like a fucking horse tranquilizer or something, an my dad was just trying to get some oxys for his back. ( i mean the addict inside of him may have wanted to be grateful to take oxy, but he was clean a couple years he had a crack cocaine problem not an opiate problem ) it's messy for sure but the point is that was the first indication to me that things on the street were becoming a problem but I didn't really clue in on it until a few years later when it REALLY HIT! like 3.5 years ago id say is when things started shifting we started getting all that purple fentanyl being sold as heroin, then the blue stuff. An' now there's nothing safe at all about anything. You buy peroccet there's a risk of them being fake pills, you buy cocaine there's a risk of it being fentanyl cut, you buy crystal meth (which was my biggest problem) and there's a huge risk of it being cut with fentanyl. it's just fucking CRAZZY!!!!!!!!!!!

Man you brought up some really good points and it actually really disturbs me and bothers me how they operate in NA and CA and other rooms. It's really unfortunate and yah you're right it's killing people. There's this really strong idea forced and there's all this talk of ""willingness"" and this strong language and really strong ideas about ""the program""


And to answer your question.. I am definitely concerned about the stigma and the way that people are gonna treat me at meetings. I actually found a sponsor in A.A this week who had talked to a few people and who had experience sponsoring somebody on methadone before (that person is actually now dead unfortunately, I knew him but NOT WELL AT ALL, he actually tried to 12 step me before years ago before he left the program) but yeah i  was grateful to find somebody willing to work with me through A.A and I started going through the book with him yesterday. He told me not to worry about it that it's an outside issue and that I'm clean if I think I'm clean and that felt really good but he warned me that people are going to have their own opinions about it, and that's where to answer your questions i'll say ""I DONT KNOW!"" I am actually really upset that I already shared that i was on methadone with as many people as I have. I feel half like a fraud because i want to move forward not telling people that I'm on methadone.. to save myself from future problems.. it's really complex and confusing... I feel really lost and I am glad i found somebody who's not being judgmental about it all, but it was in A.A. 

i heard that in NA that there's two types of people, the ones who are by the book about methadone MAT and the ones who let that be between you and your doctor. I had a really hard time finding myself feeling comfortable about it and since there's not many  NA meetings in my city I started going to AA and now I""m just not going to keep sharing it with evertbody.... but yah i kinda feel like a fraud but it's confusing. 

I think you nailed it 100% man it's saving peoples lives. People are going YEARS without using anything and living functional lives that's AMAZING. I have done better since being on methadone than any other point and I admit that I'm afraid that once the methadone's out of my system, I'm afraid that it's going to be a ticking time bomb. I'm going to go really fucking slow on my taper I think I'm going to start tapering the end of may and I want to go 2 mg every other week and ride it out for over a year and when I get down to the lower number maybe I'll switch to 1 mg every other week and just ride it out. 

Didn't mean to have such a long reply lol! Anyways i fucking super appreciate all you said you nailed it on the head I think that it's a serious danger to be telling people that they should be getting off of MAT. 

To be honest my entire idea to start tapering was literally triggered by going to NA/AA/CA. If I didn't have such a problem with the hot flashes/sweating everyday I probably wouldn't be following through next month but I have SUCH a hard time with the hot flashes/sweating that I really do want to get of of methadone. Everyone's body's are different and mine doesn't seem to hold the methadone as good as others. When I was first on it it was pretty good actually, but whatever.",1

You mentioned that she was using 2 different doctors for 2 different scripts.  Does that mean 2 different pharmacies?  Yikes! The DEA does not allow for that.  Most states have a state data base for controlled substances,  and ADHD stimulant meds are a class 2 controlled substance (same class as narcotics like oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, fentenyl, etc.). These are designed to keep things like this from happening.  I worry about the pharmacy(ies)... do they know?  They can get in big time trouble,  and they should be refusing to fill the second script at the least.  There are legitimate cases where a person could have 2 scripts concurrently, such as  long acting in the AM and short actind in the afternoon, but they would be from the SAME doctor and should indicate that on the script. 

Taking Adderral during pregnancy is not completely contraindicated. While some studies show it can increase birth defects,  not enough data proves this as a blanket statement.  I.E. pregnancy + Adderrall does NOT = birth defects. I wouldn't worry about the kids unless the pediatrician is concerned. 

That being did,  however,  her lies and deception around the children (and you)  is very concerning. A therapist would do wonders for her,  and getting a psychological workup that includes ADHD would be helpful. She should not be getting this script without a proper diagnosis. And if she is diagnosed, there is a non-stimant ADHD med called  Straterra (Atomoxitine)... I'm actually on it for diagnosed ADHD.

If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

I literally came here looking for the same answer.  I just had a pharmacist tell me ketorolac is a narcotic and another pharmacist at a different location fail to fill my phone prescription for a non-controlled substance.  A robot would never fuck up either. 

Nor would a robot deny me the sale of syringes; I use hypodermic needles for alot of strange things from cleaning my camera mirrors to applying small amounts of glue or the innoculation of rye substrate jars for the cultivation of lions mane fungus.

Is there evidence he died of an overdose more than just the amount he took?  It seems pretty rare that someone acting so outlandish they need to be restrained can then end up nodding out and overdosing.   Overdose on opiates usually occurs pretty instantly or at least after they‚Äôve appeared to be knocked out after some time.   Idk maybe I‚Äôm wrong, what is the totality of the evidence of overdose?   Does it make a difference if there was no sign that he was overdosing because there‚Äôs no possible way I could tell from the video that he was about to overdose on fetanyl.

I‚Äôm not against restraint, and to be honest I don‚Äôt know if this is standard restraint or how dangerous.  Maybe it is 1 in a million chance that some thing could happen, my main concern is that Chauvin kept going, and if it was a fetanyl overdose than Chauvin should‚Äôve acted differently too.  Not sure what you mean I‚Äôm justifying the fetanyl use.  If you mean illegal drug use, I‚Äôve been involved in drug addiction treatment communities for about a decade and know that rehabilitation more often than not leads to a completely different person who is more of a model citizen than most.   Drug addiction is fucked and I think that anyone pharmaceuticals who is responsible for the gross distribution of high priced opiate painkillers, especially to low income communities who are prone to despair and can‚Äôt afford prescription drugs but can afford the 100times cheaper heroin should be in jail for life.

For this most recent one, I had local anesthetic for the procedure and left the hospital 15 minutes after the surgery itself. I didn‚Äôt use the oxycodon that was prescribed for pain, instead I was able to cope for 2 days on ibuprofen and acetaminophen by alternating the dosage (1 dose every six hours, respectively; so one pain medication every 3 hours). 

I had a bulky dressing for approximately 1 week. It was removed at my first hand therapy visit. I was able to wash my hands and run water over the stitches at that point. They gave me a spica split (custom made) and gauze with xerofoam pads to change daily. I could move my hand with minimal resistance internally, and absolutely no pain, and with full range of motion. 

I had my stitches removed at 12 days post-op and it looks amazing so far and feels good. 

My orders were not to put weight on that hand for 8 weeks from time of surgery, nor am I to do a thumbs up, while at the same time trying to touch the inside of my wrist. 

I have canceled all hand therapy appointments at this time because my hand/wrist feels so much better. I don‚Äôt wear the splint anymore, stopped the day my stitches came out because my hand was getting too stiff with it on. I do still have some numbness in my surgery site and some swelling but with massage that will go away and is considered completely normal.

But you cannot ignore the fatal level of fentanyl in his system, no matter how inconvenient it is for you. 

George Floyd was in a car with his dealer. He got some bootleg Fentany(maybe in exchange for passing the fake $20). When the cops showed up, he secreted two of them in his mouth to hide them. The pills dissolved---tablets, not capsules---and he ingested a fatal overdose.

Muito dif√≠cil o papo n√£o sair de ""na √©poca dele tinha disputa de verdade"" e que hoje n√£o tem mais gra√ßa e por a√≠ vai. Cara, eu adoro a F1 de antes tamb√©m, tanto que volta e meio pego pra assistir corridas dos anos 70/80/90, mas porra, assim como hoje a categoria tinha problemas antes tamb√©m. Tinha umas equipes que meu Deus, tomavam seis voltas dos l√≠deres, carros e pistas bem mais perigosos e tinha piloto bra√ß√£o mais do que hoje. Mas a categoria era ruim por isso? N√£o, era diferente, assim como a F1 n√£o √© ruim hoje.

Outro assunto recorrente √© que hoje falta disputa no pelot√£o da frente. Cara, isso √© muito da temporada, antes isso acontecia tamb√©m. Pega a temporada de 88, a McLaren ganhou 15 das 16 corridas, basicamente ficou uma disputa s√≥ entre Senna e Prost. Hoje a Mercedes e Hamilton t√£o dominando, mas isso pode vir a mudar, assim como antes houve troca nas principais for√ßas da categoria.

Outra coisa que n√£o gosto em Sennista √© demonizar os advers√°rios como Prost e Schumacher, dizer que eles s√≥ ganhavam porque tavam com melhor equipamento etc. Fazer isso, na minha opini√£o, √© diminuir o pr√≥prio Senna. N√£o tem cabimento.

It is going to take a really long time to get these people off of this crap (if ever) because they've been on it for 10-20 years thanks to a local PCP who was super liberal with his script pad and felt bad that the patient's had pain.,1
558,2021-04-07 13:07:27+00:00,"I know someone who was on morphene once in the back of a bumpy truck (something military related), and he said the pain didn‚Äôt go away, but he just laughed and said ‚Äúthat hurt‚Äù every time the truck bounced. Weird stuff",1
559,2021-04-07 12:03:40+00:00,"First off: in my opinion it is possible that a person takes most of these medications combined. I can't talk about the meds for her mental disorders or in which cases they'd combine two muscles relaxans (I know one person who has to combine 2, but ONLY in acute situations when one alone isn't enough).  Lonna? Probably not... it almost feels like she read other peoples meds and added them to her list because she added some illnesses to those she really has.

Just in general some things I personally know and want to share:

For those talking about how high the oxycodon is, it's not. It's the lowest dosage available in Austria f.e.. Here's a link of the opiod calculator our doctors use:
 https://media.springernature.com/original/springer-static/image/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-3-662-57362-4_9/MediaObjects/438242_1_De_9_Fig1_HTML.png

What doesn't make sense is that she get's a low dosage that often. Usually they would change your opiods to higher dosages (as a retarded drug)  but less often. If you still have pain peaks, you'll get low dosages of a fast working opiod. In Austria doctors don't see which meds you got prescribed by others, the only exception are medications on the drug law list because they are registered and not every doctor is allowed to prescribe them. The same with Dronabidol. 

There are a lot of people who get opiods, immunosuppressants, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, musclerelaxants, steroids, antihistamines, antiemetics, benzodiazepine and other meds combined. Because they need them. Yes, some meds interact with each other and some state a ""do not combine"" advice but doctors still say you need them (of course there are meds you really can't combine, but I talk about regular interactions). With a good reason! And not everybody who takes a long list of medications is high (or wants to get high). 

I do not say Lonna needs them - or even takes them all. I just don't like how some speak in generalizations. 

Lonna had a gastric surgery, that can cause certain chronic issues and you need to follow rules, yes. But dumping syndrome feels different than gastroparesis and has a different reason which can easily be tested if she'd stay in a hospital to figure out what exactly happens.

(I do have a gastric bypass but I also have chronic illnesses, that's why I know certain things don't add up with our munchies but I also know that some things people write here is just not true. I take a good portion of similar meds she claims and many of them can cause interactions but my doctors are still fine and prescribed them. I am for most issues in one hospital with their outpatient departments so they can consult with each other. Interactions don't always mean that you can't combine them. And I can gurantee you that I am not high, if I would be I wouldn't take any of my medications. My pain doc wants me to take Dronabidol and I refuse. So please don't say she must feel like shit, that's just not true for everybody. And don't think I am offended or am angry, I just want to share my knowledge so you don't make false conclusions for all people.)

Some of the things she says doesn't make sense. Obviously. So don't think I defend her. The zoom doc story alone was ridiculous.",1

O cara era dentro dos esquema, mas ao mesmo tempo ele era inteligente o suficiente pra querer por o nome dele na historia.

Eu acho que com 8 anos de governo ele conseguiria facilmente achar um meio termo entre crescimento economico e reformas e deixar a bandidagem feliz.

O Brasil tem 2 jeitos:

1. O moralmente belo: destroi o estado, transforma em varios paises, vira um ancapistao, sei la... mas dissolve brasilia e deixa os individuos decidirem o que eh melhor.
2. O imoral mas melhor que nada: Alguem que faz parte da gangue mas eh inteligente o suficiente entra pra cuidar do gado... literalmente um fazendeiro inteligente que sabe que o povo brasileiro/gado precisa ser tratado bem pra dar carne boa.

Agora o Brasil eh uma fazenda mal cuidada, os politicos matam o gado magro e novo... nada cresce, nada se desenvolve. O Brasil precisa de um politico inteligente o suficiente, que eh capaz de explicar pros outros membros do estado: 

""Pessoal, se a gente deixar a raleh trabalhar eles vao gerar mais riqueza, e a gente vai ter mais coisa pra roubar... vamos diminuir o estado um pouco agora, pra ter mais pra roubar no futuro. ""

Tipo aquelas milicias que cuidam do proprio povo.",1

Die roten Kapseln sind Morphin, wirken also geschluckt wie jedes Opiat (Heroin, Oxycodon, Hydromorphon, Opium, Codein ....).  


Rohypnol wirkt stark sedierend, entspannend und gibt einem das ""alles ist egal"" Gef√ºhl.

It would be different possibly if me stabbing them was entirely an accident, sure, and some might say Chauvin killed him by accident.

611,2021-04-05 17:38:47+00:00,"You did the Donald Trump ""sad!"" Thing lmao I can't with you people. 

Setting, dosage, administration. Dosage is the amount of a drug you take, administration is how you take it (smoking or drinking or injecting or snorting, etc) and setting is where you take it (hopsital, concert, etc.). If those are all safe there's a chance you won't even get addicted to a drug. Meanwhile you can get even more addicted to a ""less addictive"" drug if those are not good, you can even die. Prince accidentally took fetanyl, he took the wrong dosage thinking it was a different drug, long story short. It's not his fault he died, but that was the unhealthy part that killed him. If someone knows they are taking fetanyl, they can dose it right and not die. Prince's overall setting is important as well. He was a superstar with tremendous pressure on him who had to take pain pills for the thousands of fans who came out to see him. Being forced to take a pill will lead to bad outcomes. 

Drugs aren't bad, drugs are neutral. You can just take drugs very poorly and that's what kills you. Btw just want to point out the two major ways your brain if affected by a chemical is cognitively/performance wise, memory, etc. and Physically, so the shape, where it's activating, etc. When most people take drugs the cognitive and performance part is seriously not bad most times. Something like an Amphetamine is prescribed to millions of people, in Adderal, and it has helped a lot of people. Same with the opiods and painkillers. I take a Lexapro daily for my depression. If someone else took my Lexapro or if I took 10 of my pills that could be dangerous. Its been life changing for me. And the growing consensus around the doctors that have tested these drugs for decades is that if they are administered safely they can provide positive benefits to people, and don't really have much if any affect on damaging the brain if administered correctly, in fact you could compare vbrains on and off drugs by pictures and never know the difference. People get more addicted to different drugs. I used to drink a lot and I smoke weed. Weed is so much harder for me to get off of, and I don't want to. Alcohol took my one day to get off of and I haven't had a craving since I quit over a year ago. Alcohol is one of the only drugs you can literally die from if you quit cold turkey. Not even Heroin will do that. Same with cigarettes. Cigarettes and smoking is more addictive than actual marijuana.  The physical act of putting a cig to their mouth is what people tend to miss more than the tobacco itself. 

My larger point is that if there was a setting for Prince that wasn't so high pressure every single day of his life, maybe he avoids all of this, but plainly he shouldn't have been taking drugs at all, but someone handed him drugs and said ""you gotta dance""",1

 O Gaeco (Grupo de Atua√ß√£o Especializada no Combate ao Crime Organizado) afirmou, em nota, que os dois aparelhos ""nunca tinham sido utilizados"".

Dois homens j√° foram presos e um policial tamb√©m era alvo de mandado de pris√£o, mas foi morto no fim de semana, √†s v√©speras da deflagra√ß√£o da opera√ß√£o.

  

 Apontado como chefe de uma mil√≠cia no Rio de Janeiro, Adriano tamb√©m √© descrito pelo MP-RJ como tendo sido [membro do esquema da suposta ‚Äúrachadinha‚Äù](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/12/contas-de-miliciano-foram-usadas-em-rachadinha-de-flavio-diz-promotoria.shtml) no antigo gabinete do senador Fl√°vio Bolsonaro (Repulicanos-RJ) na Assembleia Legislativa.

 O ex-capit√£o, [expulso dos quadros da PM](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/ex-pm-trabalhava-para-bicheiro-quando-foi-heroi-de-bolsonaro-diz-depoimento.shtml) por envolvimento com o jogo do bicho, tinha a m√£e e a ex-mulher nomeadas no gabinete do filho do presidente Jair Bolsonaro.

 Ex-integrante do Bope (Batalh√£o de Opera√ß√µes Especiais), Adriano era [amigo e foi companheiro de batalh√£o de Fabr√≠cio Queiroz](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/06/queiroz-e-advogado-dos-bolsonaros-atuaram-para-contatar-miliciano-foragido-afirma-promotoria.shtml), ex-PM, ex-assessor de Fl√°vio e apontado como operador financeiro da ‚Äúrachadinha‚Äù.

 O ex-capit√£o foi morto num s√≠tio em Esplanada (170 km de Salvador) em 9 de fevereiro de 2020 numa opera√ß√£o da Pol√≠cia Militar da Bahia com a participa√ß√£o de agentes fluminenses. A pol√≠cia da Bahia afirma que ele disparou contra os agentes quando foi localizado. Ele estava foragido h√° um ano sob acusa √ß√£o de comandar a mil√≠cia da favela Rio das Pedras.

 No s√≠tio foram [encontrados 13 aparelhos celulares](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/03/celulares-de-adriano-miliciano-ligado-a-flavio-bolsonaro-chegam-para-pericia.shtml). Dois pertenciam a outras pessoas e foram devolvidos aos donos, segundo a pol√≠cia. Os demais foram enviados para o Rio de Janeiro.

 Dias depois da morte de Adriano, o presidente Jair Bolsonaro [demonstrou preocupa√ß√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/bolsonaro-quer-pericia-independente-em-corpo-de-miliciano-ligado-a-flavio.shtml) com os telefones. ‚ÄúSer√° que a per√≠cia [oficial] poder√° ser insuspeita? Eu quero uma per√≠cia insuspeita. N√£o queremos que sejam inseridos √°udios ou conversas no celular dele‚Äù, disse.

 Cada um dos celulares foi colocado dentro de um envelope lacrado e enviado para o Rio de Janeiro. A Justi√ßa autorizou per√≠cia da Pol√≠cia Civil e a extra√ß√£o de dados pelo MP-RJ atrav√©s de um programa chamado Cellebrite.

 O inqu√©rito da Opera√ß√£o G√°rgula indica que a abertura dos envelopes no Instituto de Criminal√≠stica da Pol√≠cia Civil fluminense ocorreu em dois dias distintos: 6 e 15 de maio de 2020. Os autos apresentam apenas a ata de abertura do dia 15, no qual est√£o listados 3 celulares cujos relat√≥rios de an√°lise de dados est√£o no processo.

 H√° dois CDs com os laudos da Pol√≠cia Civil, um para cada dia de abertura de envelope, cujo conte√∫do n√£o est√° p√∫blico. Por√©m o inqu√©rito n√£o mostra a lista dos celulares retirados dos envelopes no dia 6.

 Segundo o MP-RJ, esses dois celulares n√£o foram periciado pelo Cellebrite. A ferramenta √© capaz de recuperar dados apagados, mas n√£o de aparelhos restaurados ao padr√£o de f√°brica, segundo dois peritos consultados pela **Folha**.

 ""N√£o havia o que extrair pelo Cellebrite porque restou comprovado que os telefones celulares eram novos e nunca tinham sido utilizados"", afirma o Gaeco, em nota.

 Os documentos do inqu√©rito mostram que havia dados relevantes sobre troca de mensagens em apenas 3 dos 9 aparelhos analisados. Eles se concentram no per√≠odo em entre outubro e novembro de 2019, e fevereiro de 2020, dias antes da morte de Adriano.

 N√£o h√° nos dados extra√≠dos refer√™ncia a Queiroz, Bolsonaro ou Fl√°vio.

 [Na investiga√ß√£o do MP-RJ sobre a ""rachadinha""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/12/entenda-a-denuncia-contra-flavio-bolsonaro-e-o-que-deve-ocorrer-em-2021.shtml), contudo, promotores apontaram ind√≠cios de que o advogado Luis Botto Maia, ligado ao senador Fl√°vio Bolsonaro, [se comunicou com o miliciano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/06/queiroz-e-advogado-dos-bolsonaros-atuaram-para-contatar-miliciano-foragido-afirma-promotoria.shtml) em dezembro de 2019, quando o ex-policial militar estava foragido.

 Segundo os investigadores do caso da ""rachadinha"", Botto Maia e M√°rcia Aguiar, mulher de Queiroz, se encontraram em 3 de dezembro de 2019 com Raimunda Veras Magalh√£es e Julia Lotufo, m√£e e namorada de Adriano, respectivamente, em Astolfo Dutra (MG), cidade da zona da mata mineira.

 A prova apresentada pela Promotoria para apontar como raz√£o do encontro a comunica√ß√£o com Adriano √© uma mensagem apreendida no celular de M√°rcia em que ela relata a Queiroz que tamb√©m estaria presente a mulher do miliciano.

 ‚ÄúA esposa do amigo vai estar com a m√£e dele ter√ßa-feira [dia 3/12/19]. A√≠ ela vai falar com o amigo sobre o recado. Depois que ela falar com o amigo, ela vai entrar em contato comigo‚Äù, escreveu M√°rcia. O amigo, para os investigadores, √© o miliciano at√© ent√£o foragido Adriano da N√≥brega.

 O m√©todo de contato com o miliciano foi confirmado pela investiga√ß√£o da Opera√ß√£o G√°rgula. Escutas apontam que Adriano exigiu que todos adotassem uma t√©cnica chamada ponto-a-ponto, na qual mantinham aparelhos exclusivos para entrar falar com ele.

 Numa troca de mensagens com uma pessoa n√£o identificada, ele orienta como devem se portar pessoas que aparentemente o encontrariam. ‚ÄúModo avi√£o. Full time‚Äù, escreveu Adriano no dia 2 de fevereiro, uma semana antes de ser morto.

 Numa outra, o ex-policial militar conversa com a namorada Julia Lotuffo na madrugada do dia 9 de fevereiro de 2020, horas antes de morrer. Na conversa, ele indica saber que algu√©m deu informa√ß√µes que poderiam levar at√© ele e afirma que mudaria de esconderijo.

 ‚ÄúVou me deslocar. Deu algum dado relevante???‚Äù Nome todo daqui ???? Ele n√£o devia ter ligado pra c√°, ne‚Äù, escreveu para Julia. ‚ÄúSegue a vida. Normal que acontecesse. [...] J√° to no rancho. Fica trank. Segue com Deus. Vai dar certo‚Äù, escreveu ele √†s 1h55 do dia em que seria morto pela manh√£.

 Os celulares tamb√©m continham sete fotos de fuzis, registradas em 2019.

 ‚ÄãA fam√≠lia de Adriano afirmou ap√≥s a morte do ex-PM que suspeitava de ‚Äúqueima de arquivo‚Äù na opera√ß√£o. At√© o presidente Jair Bolsonaro disse que pediria uma per√≠cia independente para apurar as circunst√¢ncias da morte.

 Inqu√©rito da pol√≠cia baiana descartou irregularidades na a√ß√£o e afirmou que o miliciano reagiu √† pris√£o atirando contra os agentes que foram prend√™-lo.

 O miliciano tem um hist√≥rico de relacionamento com os Bolsonaro desde 2003, quando recebeu uma homenagem de Fl√°vio Bolsonaro na Assembleia Legislativa. Em 2005, enquanto estava preso preventivamente pelo homic√≠dio de um guardador de carros, foi condecorado por Fl√°vio com a Medalha Tiradentes, a mais alta honraria da Assembleia Legislativa do Rio.

 Adriano tamb√©m foi defendido por Jair Bolsonaro, ent√£o deputado federal, em discurso na C√¢mara dos Deputados, em 2005, por ocasi√£o da condena√ß√£o por homic√≠dio. O ex-capit√£o seria absolvido depois em novo julgamento.

 Em 2007, o miliciano indicou a ex-mulher e a m√£e para trabalharem no gabinete de Fl√°vio na Assembleia. Queiroz afirmou que foi o respons√°vel pela nomea√ß√£o. Segundo o MP-RJ, as duas eram funcion√°rias fantasmas e foram denunciadas junto com o senador.

 De acordo com a quebra de sigilo banc√°rio do caso, anulada pelo STJ (Superior Tribunal de Justi√ßa), parte do dinheiro repassado a Queiroz passava inclusive por contas geridas pelo miliciano. A investiga√ß√£o tamb√©m identificou conversas entre Adriano e sua ex-mulher que indicam que parte do valor recebido por ela beneficiava tamb√©m o ex-capit√£o.",1

The 1950's was before any Rolex ""Professional"" models (GMT-Master, Submariner etc.) were mainstream commercial successes. At that point in time I strongly believe that Rolex thought the Oyster Perpetual was essentially their ticket; that was *the* watch and they would basically differentiate it with different sizes, dials, and bezel textures.

This is why the 1950's-1970's is the heyday for funky Rolex dials and bezels.

So from 3:05 you can hear Floyd say while sitting in his car ""I can't breath man, please."" He is completely untouched at this point. 

From 3:15  to 4:22 He is combative, refusing to comply  with officer's lawful commands and resisting arrest. 

6:22 He's told to stop squirming around. If you are handcuffed and you begin to act squirrelly, you will hurt your wrists.

6:55 He falls down for some reason. 

8:55 - 9:05 Officer Kueng tells Floyd to sit in the Patrol Car 8 Times. 

9:00-10:00 He wedges himself into the floorboards yelling about he's claustrophobic.

10:15 He fights back officers from getting in the car and he says he can breath again.

10:50 He can't breath again.

11:00 Again.

11:25 - 11:45 He begins kicking officers and saying he can't breath.

11:45ish is when the knee gets placed on the neck per training of Minneapolis Police as shown [here](https://twitter.com/b_stahl/status/1280913421161168897/photo/1)

Floyd last makes any noise and movement around 16:15.


This entire altercation shows the context for Ofc. Chauvin's actions. Floyd was resisting, fighting, claiming he couldn't breath for a *long* ass time. If my department allows a knee in the neck hold, why wouldn't I use that on a combative individual? I have fought with many people to get them under arrest, and even after handcuffs are placed, the fight sometimes isn't over. Police work is not a pretty job and the officer is meant to be judged by what a reasonable officer would have done in that time, not after the fact with 20/20 hindsight. 

It's why these charges won't stick to Chauvin because he's not culpable for murder. 
The Medical Examiner even showed he had a  weak heart, tested positive for fentayl and meth and COVID. 

Would I have done it, if it were in my policy and training, more than likely. As almost any officer would have.

People always harp on the opioid epidemic but I think a lot of that stuff is overblown.  I was in a serious car accident a few years ago and spent a couple weeks in the hospital and 2 months out of work.  During most of that period I was talking 15mg of oxycotin every 6 hours.  
 
I found it trivially easy to stop talking.  The only issue I had was difficulty falling asleep for about a week while I weened myself off it.  
 
Furthermore, while I was actually hurt, it was basically a miracle drug.  If I didn't take it I would be in too much pain to do anything but lie their in pain.  I wouldn't be able to sleep, wouldn't be able to watch tv, would be able to do anything but lie their in pain.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

654,2021-04-04 02:12:28+00:00,"This does go on a bit but if you can bear with me I hope I'll be able to help in some way.
I have been taking opioids for 25 years. 

Chronic pain caused by a (long) lifetime working with horses. Lots of old injuries, Osteoporosis, painful hips, Degenerative Disc Disease of the spine. Arthritis. 
Everything hurts, even my big toes! I have broken so many bones it's ridiculous. I have Allodynia in my right shoulder and this one is often unbearable when it comes. 

On my (prescribed by the Dr) meds I can work - even though I'm old I still work on the farm with the horses, out in all weather's and it's often hard work. With my meds I can do it. I can still ride my horse. I can happily shovel shit out of stables all day long. I can get round that yard like Billy Whizz on, well, whizz actually. 

I applaud and respect you so much for managing to be so responsible about how you use them. I can't do it and it's pathetic really. 

So the problem is always the same every bloody month. I run out of my Morphine tablets and guzzle all the Oromorph too early. I do this because, yes pain, very bad pain, make no mistake about it, and an increased and quite impressive tolerance but.....I also like the antidepressant side of it. And the energy it provides is wonderful. Too wonderful. 

I run out, without fail, despite being scared to death of withdrawing. I can maybe get something from a friend who was prescribed opiates once and still has some left in the medicine cabinet. I can get a bit of Oromorph from my other friend who has it prescribed. I have to pay her back. It's silly. 

I absolutely hate asking them. I hate lying 'I forgot to put my script in'. I feel shame. 

That depression. It's really vicious, nasty and profound. Paralysing. And then, because I have no meds I am 'unavailable' to the entire world for what has become 2 weeks out of 4. I live in absolute fear of going into the dreaded withdrawal that I knew, I bloody knew, would be coming because I, at my age, known for my wisdom and honesty and good advice couldn't manage to make my script last. 

I have actually been relieved to have been ill with Covid last year because it means I can say that this is why I have to be 'unavailable' - Long Covid has been a life saver for me. Good God Almighty. 

So. The only thing which staves off these withdrawals is Loperamide, the stuff that Imodium contains to stop diarrhoea. I take 12 to start. Then another 6 a bit later and so on until I feel better but not more than 20 and less if I can. 
And it works. It really does. You can function and work. And be a human. 

BUT.....it is bad for you in large doses and can affect your heart and not in any way good. It can mess with your digestive system. 

It works but exacts a price if you keep taking it in high doses so please, if you do this don't stay on it for very long. Use it this time to get you through until you can get something sorted with your Dr and then don't look at it again. There is lots of information here on Reddit about it and a Loperamide sub too. 

Read about it and make an informed decision. 

It doesn't do anything wonderful about the depression which withdrawal brings but I do find it eases it quite a bit. I can function without wanting to die and the beautiful countryside in which I am so privileged to work doesn't look all grey and dark and foreboding. It makes a sort of existence happen instead of that awful terrible withdrawal. It prevents the raging shits. I can walk the dog and say good morning to a passer-by instead of looking at them like I want to physically assault them. 

It can and  will get you through until you can see your Dr but I wouldn't wait until next month if you decide to take the Loperamide route and have run out of your meds. You need to speak to your Dr asap. Be honest about why you've run out. 

I know that the problems with Loperamide are related to it being taken in very large doses for an extended period of time. But I'm not an expert. I do know very well the anxiety and despair withdrawing abruptly can bring. I'm an expert on this. 

I did it again last week. I ran out. I knew as I was swigging my Oromorph merrily away there and full of the joys of, literally, Spring, what was going to happen yet I still did it. All of a sudden my tablets too, all those strips I'd had, they'd bloody disappeared and it's absolutely pathetic that I still said it as I opened the meds box to see absolutely sweet bugger all....I still said to myself 'how the hell did THAT happen I had loads'. 

I went and picked up my phone and rang the Entry to Drug and Alcohol Service. I'd literally had it. My life has been ruled by this crap for 25 years. And it wasn't easing off. It was getting worse. 

Example - last summer I drove my oldest daughter, her partner and my grandson from Wales to the South of France for a road trip.  Lockdown, I'd had Covid, we were pissed off and we wanted to actually DO something so off we went to be free. 
Except I wasn't free was I? We didn't hang about. We left in the middle of the night and were in France by 7am next morning. Marvellous. I drove the entire way. It was great. 

But the day before I'd been stressed to all hell and back. And forth. And then back to the surgery and then the pharmacy. Then did it all backwards. Then forwards. I HAD to secure a script before I could leave. If I hadn't done so I couldn't, literally could not and would not have gone. No point. I would have spent the whole time in full blown withdrawal just in time to drive back. 

Then the real time came to drive back. No tablets. No Oromorph. Because I'm a stupid old bag. 

I have to go to the pharmacy on our way to the autoroute and explain to the woman that we have a very very VERY long drive ahead and myself and my Grandson (who was sitting in the car eating a large baguette as I spoke) have very very VERY bad diarrhoea. Ooh  I will need 6 boxes is this possible and as long as it's Loperamide I think we'll be ok. It is? Oui and Merci beaucoup. Au Revoir. 

I am a liar. But I'm not. Not naturally. It's not who I am.
But I just lied. An opiate lie is ok because it has to be. 

 I am so glad I decided to use my phone a few weeks ago. I am so thankful for the people at the clinic who know. Who have heard it all yet still treated me with respect and reassuring kindness and who said it was going to be alright.

 I begin treatment with a Buvidal injection on Wednesday this week. I will deal with the pain I know is coming some other way because I'd rather the pain. It means I'm alive.

Whatever my experience brings to you if you have made it this far - and I am sorry for rambling, it's age not opiates - remember that you aren't alone. I promise. You aren't. You can message me if you need to talk or ask anything you like - I am too long in the tooth, like my old Mare, to mind anything much. 
I do understand how you are feeling right now. I know it well. And there are lots of us. It brought me a lot of comfort when I found this out. Reddit is so good really. 

God bless you sweetheart. It will be ok.

&gt;&gt; All but one said the autopsy findings and other court documents, coupled with the well-known chain of events that evening, made death by a fentanyl overdose unlikely to impossible.

The above sentence says death was not due to fentanyl overdose, which is also consistent with fentanyl being a contributing factor to death.

&gt; Regarding the other point about ""significant conditions,"" those are not the cause of death; from the CDC on how to fill out death certificates. 

Quoting from [The FBI report, page 7](https://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-20-12951-TKL/ExhibitA11162020.pdf):

&gt; When a death was labeled a homicide, it was not a legal ruling being made.  The label was classified as such for public health purposes.  A classification of homicide means that the actions of some else contributed to the death.

So the Baker report seems to list only one ""cause"", pulmonary arrest.  The rest, exertion before restraint, restraint and neck compression, health issues, fentantyl seem to be referenced as contributors.

Sorry, you see it differently?  Check the report link above, I would expect this to be crystal clear if there is formal terminology invovled.",1

Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,

Most clinics take people the same day or next day Mon-Thurs 6AM-11AM maybe a little later at some but at my clinic they have the new people come at 6, 630, 7 or 730 because it takes 3+ hours for intake and to see and clear with the doc. Basically you need to call the clinic at like open time which is usually 6am sometimes earlier and try to get in that day or next day at worse but I am yet to see a place to take anyone on a friday or weekend so maybe call Sat morning and get on the schedule for monday. I have heard of a couple places out there that have wait lists but they arrent common at all for methadone especially if your near a decent sized city with 20K+ people I would say. 

Just because my biggest questions were around what to expect day 1.. you go in with ID and insurance card if you have it and fill out the basic medical paperwork of what meds your on.. you drug use history and all that stuff.. remember you have to qualify for methadone by having a habit of over a year I think (maybe 3 i forget).. since subs make you sick you have that going as I switched from subs myself but the first clinic i went denied me and forced me to stay on suboxone because the doctor was a chump and i was honest and said I never used herion only pills for 5 years and he lied and said i didnt qualify which I later moved clinics and verified. After paperwork you prob meet a counselor and fill out a ton more paperwork and setup goals and mettings and what you have to do and what they expect etc.. they go over that you have to come daily until so long pissing clean like 6 months or sometime you start getting take homes 1 day at a time.. with covid they have been doing more temporarily just a fyi.. after that they test you TB usually, aids/HIV and basic blood work.. then you piss and the tech tells you what she did or did not find in your piss and if you qualify off to the doc... he asks how long you using and all that crap and he tells you the law and how dangerous methadone is when you start it (this is legit) and if everything is cool he will OK you to dose that day or if not cool you might have to do something or wait so long if they find benzos in you etc.. basically you want just Herioin/Oxy/Fent or whatever in your piss. Also you need to show in at least some withdrawl.. they will tell you to not use from around 6pm the night before. You would get 30mg usually first dose, 35 or 40 the second and third day usually and 50 the forth day I think it was.. then every 4th day youll go up 5 or 10mg depending on how your doc does it till your target dose.. which he will guesstmate and you will be telling them how you feel and they will find the right dose which is usually 80mg - 120mg on avg.. Myself and a lot of people ive seen are on 100mg it seems to be that point of 24 hour coverage for the avg person but i know a dude who was a big time user and he does fine on 45mg but hes also a big time liar and from what I understand if you stay under 50mg you can possible use and still feel a buzz and he claims he fails piss tests because of poppy seed bagels lol but if you do the reseatch the stable people seem to be on about 100mg.. but it take a few weeks to get stable .. I felt find after two or three days and I never felt awful to the point of usuing day 1-2 but some people do and they kind of expect it but its also dangerous. The first dose if you never had methadone before might knock you out for the day because I sure did but the 3rd day my body adjusted and I never ""felt"" it again even at 100mg+ etc.

So then news stories come out that say kratom kills people and all of a sudden people are afraid of it. The fda said something like 40 people died over a few years. But they are all almost certainly for other reasons. It doesn't cause respiratory depression so you can't just take too much and die like vicodin and heroin and fentynyl. 

But assuming that's even true, 40 people out of millions of users isn't a big death toll. We know how many are killed by smoking and alcohol but somehow that's ok? Yet  0.001% of that number dying from another substance means it should be banned? It doesn't make sense even if you believe the FDA.

If you look at this objectively,  what the officers did seem completely reasonable. When George FLoyd saw the police car, he panicked. So you have police officer who is trying to take in a suspect for alleged counterfeiting but he panicks. They couldn't just let him go (because his panicking could reasonably be viewed as intoxication, plus he couldn't drive in that state), so they restrained him until the EMT arrives. 

And i just want to note that just because George Floyd had fetanyl in his system does not make him a ""thug"", that's racist and libertarians are pro-drugs, using drugs doesn't make you a bad guy. And the counterfeiting thing has NEVER been proven. You'd think they'd point that out by now.

Nevertheless, the optics of him kneeling on a guy for 8 minutes screaming i can't breathe is REALLY bad, Chauvin was never gonna get a fair trial. Public opinion has been pretty much divided along partisan lines, and it's really unfair to Chauvin.",1

Yeah totally you really cannot trust anybody in this game, I only have one or two connects I really can trust after all these years, and one of them my best one fucking smokes meth which I hate so I always try to catch him after he had gotten some sleep, or was not off the meth, I buy by the OZ and make it last about 20 days at least plus my morphone script so I got time to wait, until he is broke and calling me and calling me and calling me to get his little 100 dollars, or 150, who cares, we go get it from the wholesaler(s) all mexicans each ones name is Primo lol (cousin in spanish) Big Primo got the best right now, but they all have fire and have never gone wrong going through that connect, have known him for years, the dudes in a wheel chair after an accident, and is honest as the day is long, probably cuz he can't run anywhere, honest enough where he would never tell the connect to step on my shit he knows I have other connects and only want the best and he is stright up honest wth me as to who he think has the best at whatever given momement, so we wait for that connect.  Only problem is he can turn into a methed out raging monster, I have had to kick him out of my car before for screaming like a maniac for no reason his neck veign bulding all out and fucking eyes popping, over absolutely nothing...just craziness of what meth can do...then I dont answer his calls have had to block him before for a month or two, he envetably appolgizes, he used to try to play like he had all the power and was like ""You need me more than I need you!"" until one day I was like dude, I do not ""need you"" we are friends, and if anything my call log should be proof enough that I infact, do not ""need you"" I like you, when you are not on that meth, we can kick it and are even friends...but that power trippin bullshit, I put that shit to bed quick.  Your story is allot like mine, I do all sorts of nice things for people who treat me right, do me favors, etc.  Buy them food, cigareetes, blunt wraps, alcohol, the whole 9 yards, gas in their tank if/ when they have a car that runs...luckily I have no one taking advantage if me right now and get a pretty mint price apparently talking to everyone here.  Anyway one good move you did and I forgot to say was, homeless people, homeless people almost always know where the good dope is at, I once got one of the most fire connects off a homeless dude by whatching him with our money and whatching what house he went to, and then he left and left his backpack and sign by the freeway onramp near a tree while he went to go shoot some of our dope in the bathroom (told us the deal was something like the dude would sell three gram bags for $160 or some weird shit like that"" turned out it was four bags of the most flame fucking shit.  I just pulled up in my bimmer a bit down the street accross from where i saw him go to, I went there myself and banged on the gate and was like yo, whatsup, this is (fill in the blank) I am homeless dudes friend, I wanted to holler at you, his son ended up coming around back at the back parking lot and we met and said whatsup to eachother, told him I tried the dope and it was great and could we exchange numbers, he was like yeah after he talked to his dad apparently they had been looking to expand find new customers anyway, so they made some comment about being pissed at the homeless dude for leading us to their house, but seen my flashy car, and the money in my pocket and were down as a clown to serve me, and would even drive it up to me at my condo by the golf course.  Moral of the story is, yeah you can find the best dope through homeless people, no you can never trust them, you can never trust, trust very very few people, and even then people have their flaws, but as long as they never steal from me I am good, I can put up woth a little bullshit and bad shitty attitude for an hour to cop some of the best, then see you again next month if your not methed out, if its really good I might just go buy two...then Im really good for a long time, as my connect keeeps calling me and calling me thinking hoping I sold it or got it off and need another one cuz hes broke and needs some money, calling and calling I hjave to turn my phone off.  If he sounds like hes in a good mood refreshed and shit when I talk to him next then its on like donky kong I pick him up and we go get the fire and I am back at my house within an hour and a half...Feel bad for you bro, feel worse for those moron greedy couple...you did all that nice shit for them and they were snaking you...fucking tools...and so so dumb to fuck over the person bringing you so much business and cash and helping turn your life around for the better snaking you at the risk of loosing you forever, and they did, and thats how it normally goes with greedy people, eventually the friend, aquaintance/ customer finds out and never talks to them again, and hopefully uses their own connect hahaaha well done sir, if I could givbe you an award I would but I don;;t know how.  u won in the end, score 2 for the good guys!!!",1

748,2021-04-01 16:42:30+00:00,"&gt; We don't know what rules Westeros followed.

I think the points that u/Andrija2567 and u/BaelishTheBard are making is that we're not discussing real history; although examples from medieval, Roman, Byzantine, Renaissance, and other periods of history were used as influences on the world of Westeros, they operate under fundamentally different rules, because it's a created world. for example, in our own universe, a parley banner to come to terms of peace or agreement is white, but in southern Westeros, it is a rainbow banner. 

when the show establishes something in its worldbuilding, as with Davos saying ""I've never known bells to mean surrender,"" the audience integrates that into their knowledge of the world. when the world changes those terms and then does not offer a further explanation, it bothers people. an in-universe explanation (often called a Watsonian explanation) exists for this very reason; we are offered no plausible reason why ringing bells would mean surrender rather than an alarm during a siege of the exact same city due to a lack of contextual cultural shifts. the Lannisters are still in power, so it's not a familial/regional/tribal thing; there have been no major changes of religion, like the Christianization of Rome. additionally, Westeros is a remarkably static world; even accounting for Sam noting that their ideas of time and historical records are flawed and exaggerated, that cultural and technological progress is slow in the Seven Kingdoms is a large part of the narrative. when the rules of siege and warfare change without explanation in a matter of less than a decade, it surprises people. 

also, in an earlier passage, you cite that bells were used as surrender in ancient Rome: 

&gt; In ancient Rome they invited people to bathhouses and gatherings, announced the beginning and the end of wars or sieges, and tolled when an armistice was concluded, the winners were saluted, and during ceremonial festivities.

however, the only citation I can find for that is [this](https://bpmuziejus.lt/the-history-of-bells.html) Lithuanian church history website, translated into English. do you have a secondary source on that? 

Maria Trumpf-Lyritzaki is the most well known historian on ancient bells, who wrote extensively on their uses for baths, the cult of Dionysius, and watch-guard signaling, but not for armistice or sieges. I've also looked at Arthur Pease's ""Notes on Some Uses of Bells among the Greeks and Romans,"" which has an entire passage on warfare, but the bells being described and debated are those that hung on the necks of elephants, not stationary ones being rung by humans. he posits that: 

&gt; its purpose is entirely practical, namely, to give warning to people of
 the elephant's approach, that they may not be trampled upon. 

although the author that he is responding to, Reinach, writing the article ""Elephas in Daremberg and Saglio,"" *Diet. des Antiq.,* suggests that the primary purpose of ""the bell was to excite the elephant."" 

looking outside of those sources, we can turn to: 

&gt; The ancients had bells for sacred and profane purposes. The hour of bathing was known in Ancient Rome by the sound of a bell; the night watchman carried one, and it served to call up the servants in the great houses. Sheep had them tied around their neck to frighten away wolves, or, rather, by way of amulet. 
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; We are told by ancient historians that in the year 610 the Bishop of Orleans, being at Sens, then in a state of siege, frightened away a besieging army by ringing St. Stephen's church bells. 
&gt;
&gt; Bells have rung to call citizens and nations to arms and have sounded over pillaged and victorious towns. Bells have given the signal for great historical massacres like those of St. Bartholomew and Sicilian Vespers. ‚Äì Frank A. Faxon, *Public Library Quarterly,* Vol. 9

759,2021-04-01 05:12:10+00:00,"Yeah, I kind of figured it was something like that. I want to laugh like a loon when people talk about folks on long term opioid therapy ""getting high"". They really have no concept of what it's all about and the sad thing is a lot of them are doctors. There is just so much that flies in the face of common medical sense, that was just created  by people who wanted  to create an anti-opioid atmosphere for their own various reasons, and the public has just swallowed it all without questioning a thing.

Well we've got it settled that you arent taking these drugs for any kind of high since thats next to impossible. You obviously can tell the difference between pain relief and euphoria, (if you can remember that far back). So it sounds pretty safe to say your opioid use is for medical purposes only.

So why are you taking more than you're prescribed? Before getting in to that too deeply, there are a couple conditions that need clarifying. First thing is opioid tolerance. It fairly normal when the opioid receptors in the brain become saturated with a specific type of opioid that it will stop having the same effect. If you keep dumping the same opioid in to the brain its going to start effecting things you dont want it to, like breathing and bowel motility. So one thing that might work for you and keep you from exceeding your Rx dose is changing drugs for a while. It doesnt have to be long, a couple months would probably do it. Let the receptors soak in a different medication for a while.

Now there has been a recent confusion created about opioid tolerance with a condition called Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH, for short). Doctors have taken to using this condition as a way to stop prescribing opioids to patients, basically by saying the opioids are causing an increase in the way the brain senses pain. There a long story behind this and many papers have been written back and forth between doctors using each other as sources to prove this condition, but the main study that uncovered OIH was based on observing the reaction of lab rats on a hotplate and interviews with heroin addicts undergoing a transition to methadone. I believe you said you experience some withdrawal when you run low on medication, so you know that increased pain just from withdrawal can be pretty eye opening. As far as I know, nobody ever interviewed the rats for their opinions of the time on the hotplate that was supposed to simulate Restless Leg Syndrome. 

If a doctor tells you that the pain medication you are on is causing your pain to increase, it would seem like a dmn good idea to stop that medicine. And thats what they have been doing these last few years, using OIH as an excuse to stop giving patients opioids, particularly if they have been on them for a fair time. The problem is that is not what Hyperalgesia is. Hyperalgesia is an increase in ALL sensation to the point of it becoming pain. The touch of clothes on the skin, the wind blowing your hair around would become painful if this was truly Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia. But doctors never let a good idea go to waste and with the anti opioid push and pressure they are under, who knows if they will ever go back to calling tolerance what it really is.

So you are probably taking more medication than youre prescribed from plain old tolerance, but there is always the unfortunate possibility that your condition has deteriorated. Since that can affect one hell of a lot more than the amount of pain you feel, this really should be your priority when you talk to your doctor. The change of medication for a while may not seem secondary, but it is.

Now youre on a long acting drug, MSContin (morphine) and oxycodone for breakthrough/pain flares. The way this combination is supposed to work is the long acting drug acts as your main (baseline) pain control. You shouldnt be digging in to the oxycodone unless you're in extraordinary pain. I know that sounds kind of scary since it probably seems like the oxycodone is doing most of the work. Its okay, its just an indication that you need something stronger as baseline pain control. Something bigger than 15mg of MSContin. To give you an idea where you stand on this (dont quote me its been a lot of years since I bothered looking to see the biggest pill they make of a drug) I believe MSContin goes as big as 200mg. Oxycodone only goes to 30mg. The MSContin (or a different long acting drug if your doc thinks its indicated) is to do the ""heavy lifting"" of your daily pain. But more than that since its to be taken on a schedule, every 12 hours (it is 12, right? they make a lot of long acting morphine drugs) its supposed to act as a pain preventative. Think about that, preventing pain. Thats why the dose goes up so high, through careful slow dose manipulation, they find out where your pain is pretty much able to be ignored. Doesn't that sound nice? And then when you have an occasional bad day, you still have an oxycodone you can take and go lay on the heating pad. Unlike a true addict, I have a feeling if you get your medication straight like it should be, there will be a point where you say ""its enough."" Since addicts are shooting for euphoria and intoxication they will never get enough until they stop breathing. Every addict is trying to relive that first opioid experience, that soft, warm, cloud that they drifted away from their troubles on. It will never happen, but that doesnt stop them from trying. So I think you need to talk to your doc about this, not so much quitting, but getting your medication re-balanced so it's effective.

Sorry but to be honest with you and to answer your concern, this can't all be pro-patient. I got to ask a sorta accusatory question, and only you know the true answer to any of this anyhow. If you are using more medication than prescribed and you run out early pretty much monthly, you have to be going through a fair number of days during which you are unmedicated. So if you can make it through a good bit of time unmedicated, how badly can you possibily need opioid analgesics? I told you it was a shitty question. But youre on a pretty fair dose of both morphine (when you consider how much is in each 15mg tablet. Its way more than 15mg) and an elephant full of oxycodone, but you still chose to take days without any medication at all rather than stretch it as prescribed. So how badly do you really need this stuff? I'm sorry, I had to ask. Now I feel dirty, like I need a shower....",1
760,2021-04-01 02:24:30+00:00,Well you may have a different definition of ‚Äú lethal‚Äù than others do.  Usually when you read ‚Äúlethal amount of fetanyl‚Äù on a toxicology report you know you say huh well that sounds lethal.  But wait coincidence?  Fetanyl will kill you by making you unable to breathe.  It‚Äôs a hundred times stronger than morphine.   He was passed out in his car.  Obviously high as hell on the body cams. I mean I get you‚Äôre biased but like that‚Äôs a lot of doubt.,1
761,2021-04-01 01:13:58+00:00,"Everything I said that wasn‚Äôt opinion based has been proven. It is 100% true based on the autopsy and toxicology reports that Floyd had 5x the fatal dose of fetanyl in his system. He also had rocks in his system. It is also 100% true that he did no die from asphyxiation from the autopsy. If you watch the body cam video you will clearly see that the officers had plenty of compassion and extreme reservation in dealing with Floyd even though he was unruly and clearly under the influence of a high level of drugs. Floyd killed him self, it‚Äôs sad he killed himself.",1
762,2021-04-01 01:13:07+00:00,"&gt;I live in a disabled apartment, I can't stand ghetto and violent people at all

Neither can most working/middle class  black  people, like my black coworkers. They are the FIRST types of black people to move out of ghetto/inner city when they can afford to avoid guys like George Floyd(a repeat violent felon who was arrested at least 2x for armed robberry,aggravated assault with a knife. One of his arrest was for  when he and 2 of his ghetto friends did a home invasion in a pregnant woman's home and Floyd stuck a gun against her belly and threatened to kill  her baby to get her to comply. Another time Floyd was arrested for stucking a gun into another woman's face).

Yet all my middle class black coworkers support the  BLM riots after repeat offenders die having  a heart attack from fentayl OD that he swallowed and exerting himself fighting the police or another BLM riot after that repeat violent felon got killed waving a knife at cops and reaching for a gun in his car or the other BLM riot where another black guy chased after 2 cops with a knife and got killed or  that other BLM riot where another guy chased after a cop with a knife and tried to kill him and got killed.

I am baffled by their blind in group tribalness. Don't they know that if these types of repeatedly arrested for often violent crime felons lived in their neighborhoods they would most likely  prey on them too?",1

764,2021-03-31 23:26:04+00:00,"My 80 cents is, up to mid to low dosage, like &lt;20mg, Oxycodon should be legal. It does more than help your physical pain disappear. In some people it helps depression and focus. Im one of them. 
Fent is scary. Not being able to move or do anything because of pain while your doctor smugly tells you he wont give you painkillers is also scary in a different way. Facing life in physical and emotional pain sucks and just feeds into one another. Im assuming this os where most peoples addictions start. But I dont know. Personally I wouldnt go past this point because Ive seen serious addiction and how is kills people. 
My take, the gov and doctors shouldnt tell us what to do because they are making everything less safe. If they want to help, impose mental health classes in elementary, middle, and highschool. It would ward off serious addictions and benefit society more.",1

The fact that Floyd also had lethal amounts of fetanyl and meth in his system at the time  doesn't help his potential covid-recovering respiratory issues, either.",-1
