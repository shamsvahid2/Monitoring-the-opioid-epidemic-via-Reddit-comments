7,2019-09-30 07:01:25+00:00,"No, what you are feeling now isn't normal. You are literally just taking amphetamines. Just like any other kid who takes amphetamines, schoolwork becomes easier. Coke, meth, or adderall will all let you get schoolwork done.

But theres a reason taking amphetamines every day to study is a bad idea. It fucks with your head. I get it, the doctor told you it was fine. There are side effects, but its just a small dosage. No problem right? Heres the thing; you're dependent. A lifelong customer. Congrats.

The thing is it doesnt take most people long to start ramping up that dosage, and soon you need something a bit stronger. Its all the same shit, and everyone loves the buzz. There actually is such thing as a gateway drug, and adderal is probably the worst. Ask the next methhead you see.

Even if you do stick to your dosage and not fuck up, your going to notice some odd shit. Emotional weirdness like mania and rash decision making. Basically your a drug addict and you start acting like one. You feel good, but dont kid yourself that its natural, its just drugs, and it isnt good for you.

You know how Oxycotin caused the opioid epidemic? ADHD medications are a mirror, except they give the shit to ten year olds. But hell, the parents are happy because the kids do their schoolwork, the pharmaceutical company makes more money, and in some instances the doctor even gets a little payout. Its a very comfortable arrangement.

The best part about it is that even the patients say it works. Because it does. You can focus better, think clearly and quickly, and it reduces anxiety. Guess what, steroids will make your body stronger too. The thing is, steroids also fuck up your hormones and make your balls shrink. What steroids do to your body, amphetamines does to your mind.

You'll work better and harder. By the time you start to recognize that you are paying a price, you wont be able to quit. All that glorious productivity would just disappear if you did, because you never actually overcame your problem, you just used a performance enhancing drug as a crutch. So if you start to realize you've been doing odd, impulsive things for no reason, what are you going to do? Throw away the crutch and start over? Nope. You'll deal with it. When the shadow people start making it hard to sleep you'll brush it off too.

My advice is to just learn to play with the hand you were dealt and skip out on the whole thing. You dont have a medical condition, you just arent the type of person who likes studying. Thats ok, theres more to life than being a student. Be who you are, throw away the crutch. You dont need it and its not good for you.",0

19,2019-09-29 13:31:48+00:00,"Formulations such as MSContin gelled up in the 90s. Hydromorphone extended release is like Adderall or Dexedrine extended release, except its beads are freaking made of concrete I swear to God at least with some effort Adderall or Dexedrine can be crushed but Hydromorphone ER requires a mortar and pestle to smash up, all of these formulations also existed in the 90s..This isn't some new technology, Purdue just took the laziest most profitable route to designing an extended release formulation, and then it spread everywhere because of course the high dosage, easily tampered pills would become a boon for addicts. Purdue knew this too. It even smokes incredibly well off foil almost as if by design, no other pills or street drugs even work so well smoked off foil. Didn't even need to crush them for addicts to take advantage of that feature of oxycontin. And then when the issues were becoming apparent in the early 00s they didn't release an updated formulation, fuck no, not until major pressure came down on them did they dare mess around with the formulation everyone loves so much!

Also, funny side note, the year Purdue released the OxyNeos, as they branded them (are you fucking kidding me with that name...?), the patent for OxyContin ended in Canada. Me and my addict friends all switched to heroin at this point, but! In Canada, the Neos came out basically in tandem (a few months ahead of) with the generic formulations of now off patent OxyContin... And guess what? Mostly all of them were the exact same design as the old Oxys! Some formulations didn't smoke well, others were very hard to crush, but some crushed even easier than OxyContin. Those generics still exist to this day, and I guarantee the best selling one is whichever formulation got it closest to the old OxyContin.",1
20,2019-09-29 13:16:25+00:00,"Yes and any pharmacist could have told them they're fucking idiots for thinking an extended release formulation of an already well understood to be addictive opiate, oxycodone, will change *anything at all* regarding its well understood physical dependence, and whilst is a decent way of removing *a few* of the psychologically addictive reenforcing effects these drugs have, they will still produce an overall pleasurable experience (just delayed a bit) that many individuals will wish to repeat. So it was all bullshit and the doctors should have known better (but frankly most doctors understand very little about the drugs they prescribe).

Not to mention the fact that oxycontin being some well crafted extended release formulation was the biggest joke among myself and all my drug addict friends in the 00s. All you do is wipe or lick off the waxy coating, crush quite easily, and snort or shoot up or take orally (for an instant release effect), no further action needed whereas MSContin (morphine sulphate extended release) had existed already and when mixed with water (or mucous in the nose) would gel up and be impossible to shoot up and very ineffective to snort (of course we enterprising drug addicts have methods to get around this as well, but they're farrrr more cumbersome and there's still some sketchiness associated with whole ordeal, possibly shooting up some wax, no good). You could also SMOKE oxycontin off foil and those pills glided along way better than any heroin would. Almost like they were designed for it. The smoke/vapour tasted good, too. That's ridiculous.",1

23,2019-09-29 12:35:27+00:00,"Hydrogenation. Using hydrogen gas on codeine will indeed yield DHC. 

Perform exactly the same reaction with the Pd/Pt Acidified catalyst on Codeine and both hydrogenation and oxidation take place. You get a mix of DHC and Hydrocodone but also Codeinone as a major impurity - this is reduced simply by continuing the reaction. 
Hydrogenation of codeineone to Hydrocodone or oxidation of DHC to Hydrocodone. In reality this is the major reaction performed where required, much harsher reactions are used to increase reaction rate and yield, thus, even for Hydromorphone production, codeine goes in keeping the phenol protected as its easy to remove later and very stable against substitution - the optimal opioid contains a phenol connected to a quaternary carbon (as is the first amino acid on every opioid peptide - tyrosine), modification here is almost always unwanted so it is deactivated. The main reaction performed here in industry is methylation of naturally occurring morphine to codeine as the most widely used opioid. 
With morphine you get a mix of dihydromorphine, morphinone and Hydromorphone. 

Reaction conditions and work up define your final product with chromatographic techniques allowing the separation of all the different semi-synthetic opioids created. 

There are other reactions using codeine that exclusively yield (and in higher yields than with the simple catalytic hydrogenation/oxidation) Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone, Oxycodone and Oxymorphone. 
None of the reactions are of as high yielding in one or two industrially and economically viable steps than than the reactions starting with thebaine. 
Starting with codeine allows some (but not all) of the advantages to using thebaine to be exploited; the main one beind dissolution into organic solvents of the different compounds depending on what is present at the 3-OH phenol, molecules with the free OH are classed as phenolic compounds and prefer to dissolve in the aqueous phase, with only a single methylation drastically changing this property of the molecule with non aqueous/organic solvents able to remove unreacted (protected) non-phenolic material (codeine, thebaine etc from the reaction via liquid liquid extraction. 

For the one pot with Pd/Pt black, none of the feedstock reactants are antagonists, making mixed products safe to use giving only opioid agonist effects orally. 

For IV you are really going to want to remove any Hydrocodone and Codeine remaining. 

Starting from codeine I would produce Hydrocodone and purify it, keeping the Hydrocodone for demethylation and any unreacted codeine back into the reactants to be used again. 

Perform the demethylation if Hydrocodone or Oxidise to Oxycododone. You might consider protecting the 6-ketone with ethylene glycol forming the acetal. 
Separate any unreacted Hydrocodone for oral use or to be used again - unfortunately here a lot of the  Oxycodone will go with it. Best to demethylate as much as possible leaving Hydromorphone/Hydrocodone (easily separable) or Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxymorphone and Hydromorphone. 
Here it’s easy to separate the morphones from the codones but not as easy to separate them from each other. 
Nevertheless Hydromorphone or Oxymorphone with the other as an impurity is safe to IV. 
Oxycodone, while safe to IV, is not safe to IV with a Hydrocodone impurity so this material must be used in a further reaction, end use orally only, or discarded. 

If you do indeed wish to use IV, I would recommend starting with Morphine as you will never make a thing that is unsafe to IV without additional of an alkylating agent of which none of the reactants for conversion to the xx-Morphone drugs are. 
Even with little further workup, a realistic scenario of Hydromorphone with a major impurity of unreacted Morphine and minor impurities of Dihydromorphine and Morphinone is still safe to IV, will feel like very itchy Hydromorphone and gram for gram will be less potent than pure Hydromorphone. 

Even if this is the best you can do, it’s still a good exercise, safe to consume the products, safe to conduct the reaction and in even the worst case scenario you still get a product that is safe to use and more potent than the morphine that you put in. 

If you have Acetyl Chloride or Acetic Anhydide, you can produce 6-MAM (the major product of the reaction, it’s inactive, different reaction conditions and concentration of acetylating agents ratio to the acetic acid you conduct the reaction in push the reaction in the direction of producing more Diamorphine but the major product of the crude reaction is 6-MAM). 
This is a bit useless except for direct end use and o ou improves potency by around 2x less than than what we achieve by modifying Morphine into Hydromorphone and switching to IV use (20x potency increase from oral morphine). 

You can still however apply Acetly Chloride for example to Hydrocodone and Oxycodone for a minor increase in potency and to Hydromorphone for a moderate increase in potency by forming inactive 3-Acetylhydromorphone which is transformed into Hydromorphone in the brain, the former however having greater lipid solubility. 
The same reaction on Oxymorphone allows for a double acetylation as the Hydroxy group that makes Oxymorphone more ‘Oxy’ than Hydromorphone can also form an Ester. 
Again for reasons of improved lipid solubility and rapid in vivid metabolism, Diacetyoxymorphone can be produced in low yields from the Hydromorphone one pot, Acetylation to Acetylhydromorphone. A further oxidation/dehydrogenation to produce a diene in ring C which is then oxidised with Hydrogen Peroxide and then further hydrogenation to Acetyloxymorphone which can then be acetylated again into Diacetyloxymorphone at the 14 position, this is moderately more potent than Oxymorphone and feels almost exactly the same, an opioid which many enjoy over all others. 

All possible (With yields going down as complexity increases) with HCl, NaOH, Morphine, Acetic Acid, Acetyl Chloride/Anhydride, Calcium Hydroxide, Activated Carbon (if you are starting from Opium) and very expensive but reusable micronised Pd/Pt black powder catalyst and a bit of glassware and common sense. Still very much worth doing if you have relatively pure morphine to begin with, it can be difficult to get hold of watched precursors, but there’s only AA,AC needed for this experimentation and it you can get away with doing the whole thing leaving the 3-OH unprotected and doing without the more potent (inactive but active after metabolism) Acetyl derivatives at the end. With relatively little effort one can extent ones opioid supplies from weeks to years at the same dose, none of us capable of doing this don’t really have any excuse for running out and suffering WD again: although I do respect the will to use what we’ve got (if it’s active) immediately and the lowered ability to plan ahead when one is under the influence of opioids, we tend to live from dose to dose to be a bit of forward planning can take away that fear of ‘where’s my next dose coming from’ a major source of anxiety. Plus it’s hugely beneficial financially of course buy weak, convert to something stronger, live happily (or profit, depending on ones inclinations).",1

But most manual tasks are done by the nurses anyway. The doctor won't be doing the ECG or blood draw themselves.

Why isn't there a difference with morphine then? It seems like both in morphine result in hydromorphone. Perhaps I've been getting wrong information online.

Lastly, do you think mixing acids would increase yields? Like doing HCL, sulfuric acid, and maybe citric acid, instead of just one mineral acid? I know, I know, it's probably a stupid ideas.

- As far as getting resources, you could see about working alongside a local homeless shelter or church. More and more pro equality churches are cropping up. Even if they're not leftist, if they're willing to help, it can be good. 

- If you don't know the dealer, seek harm reduction. I would donate fetanyl testing kits and narcan (a drug that can stop opiod overdoses).  Since both can be expensive when purchased in bulk, you could encourage locals to donate, or post a flyer offering to test people's stuff for free or very cheap, which would keep you from having to buy a new kit for every person.

- Donate clean syringes if possible. 

- I don't know where you live, but you might be able to work with a charity to provide free or discounted HIV/bloodborne illness tests. If you can't afford that, even posting information on sterilization techniques could be beneficial.

- You could also decide whether you'd like to advocate for drugs which have the potential to help addiction. Many people swear kratom has helped them withstand withdrawals and quit opiates. Depending on where you live, kratom can actually be very easy to buy, since many places haven't made it illegal. Iboga, a psychoactive tree bark, can be used in small doses, and has been found to help significantly with opiate addiction because of how it affects opiate receptors. It can also be used in high doses for extremely intense self reflection, like a 30 hour ayahusca trip, but this can be very dangerous if you're not knowledgeable about it- which most people aren't. I'm not a pharmacist, so I can't really promise these things will work, but I've heard good things about them. Do some research and ask the folks over on /r/psychonaut.

 Tudo conspirava em favor de Zelenski até aqui, a despeito de sua total inexperiência política. Até dezembro, era conhecido no seu país apenas por fazer o papel de um presidente acidental, um professor que foi eleito após um discurso anticorrupção dado a alunos viralizar na internet.

 Tudo foi transportado para a realidade: Zelenski virou candidato na virada do ano e até seu partido, o Servo do Povo, tem o mesmo nome da versão televisiva. Não foram poucos que viram nisso o dedo do bilionário que comandava o canal que veiculava a atração, mas o presidente foi em frente.

  Acabou no segundo turno com o então presidente Petro Porochenko, heroi da autodenominada revolução de 2014, que derrubou o governo pró-Kremlin em Kiev —e levou Vladimir Putin a patrocinar a secessão e [anexação da península de maioria russa da Crimeia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/crimeia-vive-limbo-geopolitico-cinco-anos-depois-de-anexacao.shtml), seu mais audacioso golpe externo em 20 anos de poder.

 Vencendo de forma arrasadora, com 73,2% dos votos, Zelenski trabalhou então para superar o principal calcanhar de Aquiles de sua versão da TV: o Parlamento. Evitou conviver com um premiê e congressistas hostis e adiantou as eleições de outubro para julho.

 Aproveitou a onda favorável e, como o presidente Emmanuel Macron havia feito em 2017 no pleito parlamentar após sua vitória na França, levou seu novo partido a dominar o Legislativo com 254 de 450 deputados.

 O próximo passo [foi buscar conversar com Putin](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/07/putin-e-zelenski-tem-primeira-conversa-sobre-paz-na-ucrania.shtml). A relação com a Rússia é a mais espinhosa questão externa de seu país desde que foi separado da União Soviética, em 1991, e o país tem grande população russa étnica —o próprio Zelenski, judeu, fala primariamente a língua de Putin.

 Os russos consideram que a Ucrânia é um elemento de separação física de seu país com o Ocidente, e a adesão a estruturas como a a Otan (aliança militar liderada por Washington) é vista como inaceitável. Zelenski procurou Putin, abrindo um canal que estava fechado desde que o Kremlin apreendeu navios e aprisionou [marinheiros ucranianos no fim do ano passado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/07/ucrania-detem-navio-russo-em-retaliacao-por-prisao-de-marinheiros.shtml).

 O telefonema coloca todo esse esforço do neófito abaixo. Sua linguagem corporal algo abobalhada durante a reunião com Trump transparecia a dificuldade de se ver no meio de um imbróglio de implicações tão graves. Tanto que passou da negativa de falar sobre a conversa para um ""não quero me meter"" inconclusivo.

 Para piorar, a [transcrição da Casa Branca](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/09/leia-a-integra-da-transcricao-da-conversa-entre-trump-e-o-presidente-da-ucrania.shtml) mostra o comediante que virou presidente chamando Trump de professor e falando mal da Europa, na figura da chanceler alemã, Angela Merkel. Ele concorda veementemente com o americano que são os EUA, e não a Europa liderada pela Alemanha, que agem para fazer valer os interesses da Ucrânia em se ligar ao Ocidente.

Jane did not OD, she asperated in her sleep.

From what I've learned it's good practice with haroin users to sleep on their side while using to keep from choking to death in case you vomit in your sleep because you don't have the ability to roll over or save yourself if you do so. In fact, most junkies will warn new users of this so they won't die in their sleep. It's mostly out of self preservation than as a courtesy because most users shoot up in a group due to convenience...if someone has plenty of junk and are willing to share, then you just might get a fix just from hanging out with them, or you're gonna go over to your dealer's house or base of opperation and fix there after you buy. Or your dealer or fellow user will come over to your home and fix you up and get fixed themselves while there, or you all share the same space at a ""shooting gallery"" and get fixed together...and once you fix, odds are you're gonna pass out on the spot. And when you pass out, you're helpless. So if someone OD's or vomits in their sleep and asperates, nobody wants to deal with the responability or hassels in the aftermath of an accidental death due to haroin use because there's the possibility of everyone else being passed out and not able to help. If I recall correctly, Jane actually warned Jesse about laying on his side once the junk hits as she was shooting him up for the first time in the show. So....

When Walt tried waking Jesse up he inadvertently rolled Jane over, after a few momments she began to spit-up and asperate. Jane did not OD, she choked to death on her own vomit in her sleep.",1

96,2019-09-24 16:02:58+00:00," O Japão sabia há uma década que sediaria a [Copa do Mundo de Rúgbi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/09/onde-ver-destaques-e-o-que-mais-importa-na-copa-do-mundo-de-rugbi.shtml) deste ano. Mas só alguns meses antes do pontapé inicial a cidade de Kobe percebeu o que isso lhe reservava. Cerca de 36 mil torcedores da Irlanda, Inglaterra, Escócia e África do Sul estavam a caminho. Sendo torcedores de rúgbi, eles com certeza chegariam perigosamente sedentos.

 O conselho de turismo de Kobe precisava informar a cidade. Em um seminário em maio, restaurantes, bares e hotéis foram instruídos a se preparar para uma corrida a toda forma de bebida envolvendo lúpulo e malte, quente ou fria. O conselho escreveu em um panfleto informativo que ""as potências mundiais do consumo da cerveja estarão reunidas em Kobe?!""

 Os palestrantes do seminário explicaram que os irlandeses [bebem duas vezes mais cerveja](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/reuters/ult112u1970.shtml) que o japonês médio e alertaram que ingleses, escoceses e sul-africanos não ficavam muito atrás. Para qualquer estabelecimento cujo negócio envolvesse servir bebidas, o conselho oferecia uma orientação: prepare quatro ou cinco vezes mais cerveja do que costuma.

  ""Enfatizei no seminário que os torcedores de rúgbi bebem o dia inteiro"", disse Naofumi Machidori, funcionário da prefeitura de Kobe.

 Em um país que se orgulha de estar preparado [para toda espécie de desastre natural](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/09/japao-enfrenta-seu-tufao-mais-forte-em-25-anos.shtml), uma seca de cerveja causada pelo rúgbi não representa um temor ocioso. Dois anos atrás, o estoque de cerveja do Estádio Internacional de Yokohama acabou na metade de uma partida. Não por coincidência, o Japão estava enfrentando a Austrália.

 Assim, o país anfitrião tomou medidas sérias para garantir que o torneio de seis semanas atenda às demandas dos torcedores mais beberrões do esporte. Os bares de todo o país funcionam até mais tarde nos dias de jogos. Os governos municipais organizaram bares de emergência para manter as torcidas lubrificadas a caminho dos estádios. E a fabricante de cerveja Kirin mais que triplicou sua produção da [cerveja ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/02/livro-sobre-a-heineken-expoe-dilemas-de-fazer-negocios-em-paises-pobres.shtml)[Heineken](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/02/livro-sobre-a-heineken-expoe-dilemas-de-fazer-negocios-em-paises-pobres.shtml), a cerveja oficial da [Copa do Mundo de Rúgbi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/09/contratar-tecnico-neozelandes-vira-tendencia-no-rugbi-mundial.shtml).

 ""Falamos muito sobre cerveja"", disse Brett Gosper, vice-presidente de operações da World Rudgy, a organização que comanda o esporte. ""Para nós, importava educar os locais dos jogos e os governos das cidades sobre o que acontece em um evento internacional de rúgbi. Temos uma grande audiência itinerante, e ela bebe muita cerveja"".

 A cerveja é tão parte da [cultura do rúgbi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folhinha/2015/05/1635063-cresce-o-interesse-de-criancas-pelo-rugby-veja-aonde-treinar-em-sp.shtml) quanto a lama, os machucados e as cicatrizes. Não há como escapar disso. Ela flui livremente nas arquibancadas durante os jogos, e seu cheiro pende no ar. No Estádio Twickenham, em Londres, um dos lares espirituais do esporte, os bares das arquibancadas costumam ficar cheios e barulhentos até bem depois do apito final. Mesmo os jogadores de times rivais costumam se reunir para uma cerveja depois de tentar arrancar as cabeças uns dos outros durante a partida.

 Masaki Fujiu, torcedor veterano da seleção nacional de rúgbi do Japão, experimentou de perto essa cultura na partida de abertura da Copa entre Japão e Rússia, na sexta-feira. Depois de tomar uma ou duas cervejas para relaxar antes do jogo, ele se acomodou no estádio e concentrou suas atenções na partida. A única coisa que o levava a alterar o foco eram os ruidosos e beberrões torcedores russos em sua fila, reciclando cerveja em ritmo tão rápido que tropeçavam nele a cada vez que passavam correndo para ir ao banheiro.

 ""Nós japoneses não somos capazes de beber tanto assim"", disse Fujiu.

 Mas os torcedores de rúgbi sul-africanos são. Dentro do Estádio Internacional de Yokohama no final de semana de abertura da Copa, Steve Evans e seus dois filhos adultos carregavam cada qual seis latas de 500 ml de cerveja para seus assentos, em embalagens de papelão, para a partida do [Springboks](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/09/morre-chester-williams-heroi-do-rugbi-sul-africano-em-1995.shtml) contra a Nova Zelândia. Só por garantia. Eles não queriam repetir o risco da calamidade que sofreram no voo ao Japão, cujo estoque de cerveja se esgotou na metade da viagem. Especialmente, disse Evans, quando a cerveja é tão ""fundamental"" para a apreciação do esporte.

 ""Nós provavelmente beberemos umas oito durante o jogo, e depois continuaremos"", ele acrescentou.

 Os torcedores do rúgbi não se limitam a beber muito. Também bebem rápido. O que é menos que ideal em um país que serve cerveja em copos pequenos. Assim, para ganhar algum tempo para os bares e restaurantes entre cada rodada, as fabricantes de cerveja japonesas Asahi e Suntory os aconselharam a usar canecas para atender os visitantes estrangeiros.

 Nem todo mundo será capaz de lidar com o problema. Yasunori Kanemura, que dirige um bar cujo tema é o rúgbi em Kobe, sabe que pode enfrentar dificuldades. Seu estabelecimento só acomoda 15 pessoas, e ele não tem espaço para armazenar barris adicionais de cerveja.

 Isso não é problema para um pub de tema britânico chamado Hub, em Yokohama. Informados sobre a potencial escassez de cerveja, os empregados empilharam barris em volta do balcão para os torcedores locais e estrangeiros que foram lá a fim de assistir Austrália e Fuji. O gerente do bar, Hiroki Watanabe, disse que seu estoque de cerveja era 10 vezes maior que o usual, para evitar falta de produto.

 ""Vamos garantir que isso não aconteça"", ele disse.

 Watanabe afirmou que nos dois primeiros dias do torneio, os torcedores britânicos pareciam ser os bebedores mais entusiásticos, e que alguns deles tomaram até 10 canecos de cerveja cada –um cliente japonês típico pediria um ou dois. Não que ele esteja reclamando.

 ""É pena que a Copa do Mundo só dure até o começo de novembro"", disse Watanabe.

I was also sore in my left and right foot, ankle, knee, left hip, right wrist, left elbow and shoulder and I was aware of my pelvis in a way that wasn’t normal.  I couldn’t hold a cup of tea in my left hand, or pull an empty oven tray out of the oven.  Couldn’t open a door, a toothpaste cap, or a tube of mascara.

Last week I was able to fool myself into thinking that this was joint pain from overdoing OHPs and front squats at the gym.  Well, that was wrong and it’s progressed significantly; I haven’t had arthritic pain like this since I was first diagnosed nine years ago.

Thankfully I feel better today because I went to my parents’ house last night and raided their medicine cabinet (with their permission).  Today I feel better because I have oxycontin.  Technically the usual drug regime for this sort of pain would involve steroids, but I remember the awful side effects of steroids so vividly from 10 years ago that this pain isn’t enough for me to want to go back on them.  Obviously I can’t be downing oxycotin on the regular, but I remember from last time that the immunosuppressant drugs took effect after a week, enough for me to be able to function anyway.

So yay me.  Rheumatoid arthritis has, for the time being, put paid to my front squat and OHP programs and just working out in general.  On the plus side, the final week of my cut is going gangbusters because the thought of food is making me want to puke.

110,2019-09-24 00:41:11+00:00,"Edit: reading back this really isnt linked to the question, sorry!

Heroin is an opioid, in this case meaning its a fucking beast of a painkiller. Painkillers on sterioids. 

However heroin is one of the most addictive drugs, heroin is sometimes smoked, however (for a more intense high?) People sometimes inject it into themselves. 

Injecting means it gets into your blood instantly, however this also highly increases the risk of overdosing. 

However overdosing on heroin (while isnt ideal) isnt the worst to overdose on, as heroin has a counter drug, which basically undoes the effects of heroin. 

Heroin is so addictive you can get hooked from using it once, and when people get help, instead of slowly getting off herion, instead they get a legal, safer version of heroin, prescribed only to former heroin addicts. 

Heroin being mixed with fentanyl is real dangerous, unlike heroim fentanyl does not have a counter drug, and theres not much paramedics can do in an over dose.

Her doctor said that because she was young-ish, healthy and in good physical condition she qualified for a shorter waiting period.   Even so it would be at least a year before she could have the operation and by then  her opposite knee or hip would be damaged from the extra strain placed on them and will most likely need to be replaced as well.   She could not work with a bad knee and her company did not provide disability benefits.   Her income was reduced to Medical  EI which pays reduced benefits for a shorter period of time.   Because she was in excruciating pain every day her doctor prescribed her opiodes which can cause addiction.   We opted to pay for private surgery and ended up going to a hospital in Belgium.  It took 3 weeks to find the surgeon we felt comfortable with and booked the surgery three weeks later.   After six weeks of rehab she was able to go back to work in a modified job position.  Her income last year more than covered the cost of the surgery and a month long stay in Europe.     It was a 10 months after we got back from Europe when our medical system called her to set a surgery date.

He was told that he had to wait almost a full year before he could see a surgeon just to have a consultation to determine what options were available.   His company disability benefits would not begin right away because he was elgible for Medical EI.  When his EI ran out his company's disability told him that his claim was denied.  They denied him short term disability because he could not give them a surgery date or estimate of when he could return to work.   They denied him long term disability because he was 59 years old and was therefore old enough to collect his pension  - at a greatly reduced rate.   He looked at paying for private surgery here in BC but found that the price was exorbitant so he too went to Belgium.    He was quoted $13,000 to have the surgery done by a private surgeon here in BC.   For $8,500 he flew to Europe,  had the surgery and sort of enjoyed a two week holiday.   He also qualified for short term disability because he had a date set for his operation and an estimated return to work date.   He is now back to work.  

After seeing how efficient other countries are I will honestly say that our medical system is pathetic.





As a side note,  When my girlfriend hurt her knee her doctor in BC was quick to give her oxycotin for pain medication.   When my friend's father had his hip replaced (after a two year wait)  his doctor gave him a prescription for oxycondone.   Both of their prescriptions were for 60 pills with one refill and the label said *Take one or two pills up to four times daily.*

The surgeons in Belgium gave my girlfriend and my friend nothing stronger than Tylenol and Aspirin for pain.   Her surgeon told us that they only prescribe opiodes for severe and chronic pain.   Post surgical pain does not warrant the use of addictive drugs in their country.",1

He saw me in pain, understood that a big guy like me might not always display what's going on inside.  He understood that when I have a flare it's unscheduled and not always when the doc's office is open.  He took time with the physical therapy during my appointment, actually admitting when a certain technique didnt work and trying again.  

Until this new doctor I have only had experiences like you described.  Preachers masquerading as doctors really.  Look man, I didn't come here because I'm a fucking drug addict.  These days it's so easy to buy shit on the dark net, even drug addicts can do it.  But here's the thing- I don't want to DIE because of phentanol in street pills.

152,2019-09-21 04:04:03+00:00,"That fact the it's popular in your local or national culture has zero bearing on whether it's objectively ""isn't that much"" or not. That objectivity is decided by science, not culture. The facts are that MDMA shouldn't be consumed more than \~5-6x per year total or within \~45 days of a previous MDMA dose. MDMA should never be dosed at more than arguably \~300mg per 24hr, and no more than \~200mg in any one single dose (e.g. taking 100-200mg at once orally/nasally/rectally, then taking another 50-100mg booster that's no larger than 50% the original dose roughly 1-4hr after the original dose). 

Those are VERY liberal ""limits"" too, and it's very likely at least some limited damage is occuring over time if that dosing ""protocol"" is followed for as much as \~3-5+ years without substantial breaks. A much more conservative dosing protocol to ensure there's no statistically significant physical or mental damage from MDMA use would be closer to no more than \~4 or less MDMA dose per year, no taking MDMA within \~60-75 days of a previous dose ( I believe Shulgin himself suggests 3 months minimum between doses), only taking a maximum of \~150-200mg MDMA per 24hr depending on body weight, only taking a maximum of \~100mg or possibly up to 150mg MDMA within any single time window smaller than 1hr (so even though a nightly limit might be \~150-200mg total, no more than 150mg, or arguably 100mg, should be taken in the initial dose...so a smart way to dose it would be say an initial dose of 100mg orally, followed by an oral/nasal/rectal dose of 50mg 1-4 hours later, that's at least 1 full hour after the 100mg dose...or say 125/150mg MDMA your first initial dose and \~75/50mg MDMA booster dose 1-4 hours later).    


MDMA is NOT a drug you want to ever use (so not even once, but especially so when used chronically) more than once a month for absolutely any reason, even if you haven't taken any MDMA in say several years or haven't even taken MDMA once before, and say there's a specific multi-day festival/concert etc. you're going to attend with the plan to ""only"" take 2-3+ pills one single night, or say 0.5-1+ pills for 2-3 nights in a row. Taking MDMA in any higher total combined dosages within a \~12 hour window/any higher combined dosages in shorter than a 59 minute time window/any more frequent than my first, more liberal guideline I listed, pretty much guarantees brain/receptor/cell ""damage,"" or at the very least causes statistically significant shifts in the size/density/severity of activation/strength of specific portions of your brain, specific neural networks, and semi-permanent or potentially permanent down regulation of certain receptor sites (e.g. receptor sites primarily activated by serotonin). I'd have to research it more to confirm this as fact, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if MDMA at least down regulates, if not full on ""fries"" certain dopamine receptor sites semi-permanently, if not permanently.

You're literally ensuring that at the very least for several years, if not for all eternity, your body will either produce less serotonin and possibly dopamine, or your body will have down regulated/otherwise damaged serotonin and possibly dopamine receptor sites, basically guaranteeing that you'll objectively get ""less high"" on future MDMA doses, almost all other drugs, and even less high on fucking life itself. 

You'll basically feel significantly less enjoyment from all the normal pleasurable experiences that the human experience has to offer...whether it's eating food or drinking water, exercising, completing a mentally rewarding achievement that required delayed gratification, and even orgasm, both in terms of raw pleasure from less dopamine activation, and in terms of social bonding and love for a sensual partner due to less serotonin activation.  


You are objectively SO MUCH better off consuming ritalin, focalin (not sure if focalin exists in Europe as a prescription drug), dexedrine/adderall, or even meth every night you're currently using MDMA. In fact, you could likely take slightly larger doses (in terms of relatively equipotent doses of the drug compared to MDMA, not just raw mg for mg substitution) and likely even use for a slightly to moderately longer duration of action than MDMA's typical \~3-4.5 hour duration of action using ANY of the previously mentioned stimulant MDMA ""stubstitutes"" and still yield a significant, SIGNIFICANT reduction in semi-permanent (likely completely, irreversibly permanent as well) mental (both in terms of cognition and mental stability/mental health), physical, chemical/biological, and potentially psychological damage/side effects. 

MDMA is sooooo bad for you when taken chronically more than once a month maximum and/or in dosages exceeding around \~150mg within \~60-90 minutes and \~200mg within \~12hr  (or especially doses exceeding \~200mg within \~60-90 minutes or \~300mg within \~12hr), that when using as often as OP states, the fact is that even when using MDMA tablet/powder/crystals that are basically proven to be ""bath salt""/RC stimulant/meth free, proven to contain at least a moderate % purity of either MDMA, MDA, or MDE, as well as proven to contain no commonly used semi-lethal or lethal drug like fentanyl/fentayl analogues, that using so-called euro street ""speed powder"" or ""speed paste"" INSTEAD of MDMA is still significantly less dangerous and damaging to your mind and body. 

\[Skip this portion if you don't use, or care to learn about, so-called ""speed"" powder/""speed"" paste\].

...(typically euro street speed is between only \~5-40% purity by weight, most often being between \~10-30% purity on the street, and almost always, arguably at least \~66-75% of the time, contains some amount of caffeine, ALWAYS contains at least 5-10% by weight but can be up to 90-95% by weight mostly non-psychoactive, hopefully side effect free inert fillers/binders/adulterants, often but   
notably less than \~50% or so of the time contains either a prescription stimulant/pseudo-stimulant such as ritalin, extremely rarely focalin, very rarely adderall, rarely dexedrine, occasionally meth, possibly modafinil/adrafinil/other modafinil analogues, possibly nicotine salts but I've never heard anything confirm that, or an actual new or existing stimulant research chemical such as  N-Ethylhexedrone aka hexen/hexen analogues, 2-FA/4-FA/related analogues, 4F-MPH and related analogues, Mephedrone and similar analogues, etc. etc., as well as of course roughly 50/50 racemix l-amph and d-amph, with d-amph being much more desirable as it causes substantially less physical negative side effects compared to l-amph, as well d-amph being roughly 4x stronger than l-amph mg for mg),...  
... In fact, I highly suggest switching over, though out of all 3-4 options I suggested, meth is definitely the least beneficial since it has moderate serotonin release. Even still, doing meth or say mystery street-speed at equipotent doses to MDMA at the same frequency of your current MDMA usage would be SUBSTANTIALLY less physically and mentally damaging to your body and brain, respectively.  I went on and on about typical european street ""speed"" purity and various adulterants to illustrate for you how dangerous/damaging chronic weekly or more MDMA usage is, and that's even assuming your E tablets are almost completely pure/contain standardized dosages. 

So yeah, seriously consider switching to another stimulant besides MDMA, preferably one that has little to no serotonergic activity (so not meth). Again, even then, street mystery speed and street meth would be substantially healthier for someone than chronic MDMA use. Get out now before your feel good receptors are fried for the rest of your life to the point than even after 5-10 years sober, you still basically feel like a so-called ""dry dunk.""",1

This isn't quite true, Opiates have long been known to not be the best answer to many types of chronic pain due to their addictiveness and a responsible doctor should be monitoring your intake to avoid abuse and trying alternatives like physical therapy to attempt to alleviate chronic pain. Opiates are not a suitable long term solution for many.

Purdue is not under scrutiny because they made a pill that people abuse. They actually did many things that contributed heavily to Oxycotin being abused. They promoted the drug *heavily*, smooshing doctors with kick backs and freebees. They had coupons giving away the first few pills free (like parents warned us drug dealers would do). They misrepresnted how long the pill would alleviate pain for by a factor of two. They did little to counter ""pill mills"", pharmacys that will essentially give the drug to anyone, some pharmacys in towns with a population of a few hundred were getting 10s of thousands of pills for years. Their marketing was always skirting the line of acceptability, they knew they're drug wasn't being as it should have been, but they actively allowed it to be misused in order to sell more of it.

There are lots of good articles on the matter, but [here] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622774/) is an impartial scholarly look at many of the things that they did wrong.

160,2019-09-20 19:01:01+00:00," A [Copa do Mundo de Rúgbi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/09/contratar-tecnico-neozelandes-vira-tendencia-no-rugbi-mundial.shtml), que começa na sexta-feira em Tóquio, deve girar em torno de determinar qual das outras 19 seleções tem o necessário para tirar o [All Blacks, da Nova Zelândia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/08/rugbi-e-materia-escolar-para-futuros-jogadores-da-nova-zelandia.shtml), vencedor dos dois últimos torneios mundiais, de seu trono.

 A Nova Zelândia caiu ligeiramente em agosto. E depois de uma derrota para a Austrália e de uma combinação de outros resultados na Europa, o All Blacks perdeu o primeiro posto no ranking do rúgbi pela primeira vez desde novembro de 2009. Por três semanas, eles ficaram menos de um ponto abaixo da seleção do País de Gales no ranking. Mas depois de uma derrota galesa para a Irlanda em uma partida preparatória para a copa do mundo jogada em casa, em 31 de agosto, o All Blacks voltou ao primeiro posto e o País de Gales caiu para a quarta posição.

 Uma semana depois, quando a Nova Zelândia massacrou a seleção de Tonga, que está na Copa do Mundo, por 92 a 7 em um amistoso, a Irlanda mesmo assim superou o All Blacks e tomou o topo do ranking, ao derrotar de novo o País de Gales. A Irlanda chega à Copa do Mundo como número um do ranking.

 Mas a maioria dos especialistas continua a considerar a Nova Zelândia como forte favorita para o terceira título consecutivo de Copa do Mundo, e seu quarto título geral. No entanto, há desafiantes formidáveis.  
 As 20 seleções estão divididas em quatro grupos de cinco times, e os dois primeiros colocados de cada um deles avançam para as quartas de final.

 Abaixo, um resumo sobre os grupos, com a posição de cada seleção no ranking do rúgbi em 9 de setembro.

 ### Onde ver

 No Brasil, o torneio terá seus 48 jogos transmitidos pela ESPN, entre 1h40 e 7h45, horários de Brasília. Não haverá exibição em canais de TV aberta. O Mundial será disputado entre 20 de setembro e 2 de novembro. A cerimônia começa às 6h30 desta sexta-feira (20), precedendo o duelo entre Japão e Rússia. A final está marcada para começar às 6h00.

 ### Grupo A

 **Irlanda (1), Escócia (7), Japão (10), Samoa (16), Rússia (20)**  
 A Irlanda é a favorita do grupo, apenas 18 meses depois de um título invicto na copa Six Nations da Europa, que se seguiu a uma vitória inesperada sobre a Nova Zelândia em Chicago, em novembro de 2016. Mas o melhor jogador da Irlanda, o ""flyhalf"" Jonathan Sexton, escolhido como melhor jogador de rúgbi do mundo em 2018, vem enfrentando lesões e fez muita falta no mês passado quando a Irlanda foi massacrada pela Inglaterra por 57 a 15 em um amistoso preparatório para a copa. Os irlandeses pareciam velhos e cansados, especialmente a linha dianteira, cuja idade média é de 34 anos e vem sendo liderada pelo capitão Rory Best, 37.

 Mesmo assim, a Irlanda ainda deve ser vista como favorita a vencer o grupo, especialmente porque Sexton parece ter recuperado a forma; Escócia e o anfitrião Japão devem disputar o segundo posto. O Japão vem impressionando em recentes partidas internacionais, e jogar em casa pode fazer dele a surpresa do torneio.

 O capitão dos Brave Blossoms, Michael Leitch, originalmente da Nova Zelândia, disse acreditar que sua seleção pode chegar ao título. Os japoneses provavelmente ganharam confiança ao derrotar os poderosos Springboks da África do Sul como azarões, na Copa do Mundo de 2015, uma vitória que muita gente definiu como a maior zebra na história do esporte.

 A Escócia não parece bem, recentemente, ainda que tenha encerrado o Six Nations deste ano com uma maravilhosa virada contra a Inglaterra. Os escoceses chegaram a estar perdendo por 31 a 0, mas marcaram 38 pontos consecutivos antes de ceder um empate no último minuto. Mas excetuada essa partida e uma série de duas partidas com uma vitória para cada uma contra a França, recentemente, a Escócia vem parecendo medíocre e é o time de primeira linha mais vulnerável à ascensão da seleção japonesa, e corre o risco de ficar de fora das quartas de final.

 Nem Rússia e nem Samoa devem passar pela fase de grupos.

 **Jogadores a observar no Grupo A:**

  * **Irlanda**: Peter O’Mahony (""flanker""), Conor Murray (""scrumhalf"")
 * **Escócia**: Jonny Gray (""lock""), Greig Laidlaw (""scrumhalf"")
 * **Japão**: Michael Leitch (Nº. 8), Kotaro Matsushima (""utility back"": ""wing"", ""fullback"" ou ""center"")
 * **Samoa**: TJ Ioane (""flanker""), Alapati Leiua (""wing"")
 * **Rússia**: — Andrei Ostrikov (""lock""), Ramil Gaisin (""flyhalf"")
  ### Grupo B

 **Nova Zelândia (2), [África do Sul (4)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/09/morre-chester-williams-heroi-do-rugbi-sul-africano-em-1995.shtml), Itália (14), Canadá (22), Namíbia (23)**  
 A primeira partida do Grupo B, entre Nova Zelândia e África do Sul, deve determinar quem fica com o primeiro e o segundo lugar do grupo. As seleções são duas das favoritas do torneio e disputaram diversas partidas espetaculares recentemente. A Nova Zelândia tem uma boa vantagem e parece ser favorita, mas, sob o comando do treinador Rassie Erasmus, os Springboks têm um empate e uma vitória recentes contra o All Blacks jogando na casa do adversário.

 A Nova Zelândia acredita que deveria receber o troféu Webb Ellis em caráter permanente, e ficou feliz ao recapturar a liderança do ranking mundial recentemente. O All Blacks prospera quando pressionado. A seleção tradicionalmente conta com o maior pool mundial de talentos, com múltiplos jogadores talentosos e experientes para cada posição.

 Beauden Barrett, duas vezes selecionado como melhor jogador mundial de rúgbi e que tem dois irmãos na seleção, é uma grande ameaça e foi movido da posição de ""flyhalf"" para a de ""fullback"" ou ""center"". Richie Mo'unga assumiu as responsabilidades da posição de ""flyhalf"" antes exercidas por Barrett, e as de chutador de penalidades e conversões, uma função nas qual Barrett enfrentava dificuldades.

 A África do Sul tem diversos defensores excepcionais, muito velozes, mas a força do jogo dos Springboks é sua defesa contra corridas e a capacidade de forçar perdas de bola pelos adversários. O ""hooker"" Malcolm Marx é especialmente bom nisso. O ""flanker"" Siya Kolisi, o primeiro capitão negro da seleção sul-africana, é um líder inspirador que acaba de retornar de uma lesão de joelho e parece estar em forma.

 A Itália é a terceira seleção de primeiro nível no Grupo B. Enfrentou Nova Zelândia e África do Sul 14 vezes cada, e só venceu uma partida contra a África do Sul. O placar coletivo da seleção italiana contra esses dois adversários deve subir a uma vitória e 29 derrotas na copa.

 Namíbia e Canadá vão jogar para vencer um ao outro e talvez apanhar a Itália em um dia de descuido e registrar uma segunda vitória.

 **Jogadores a observar no Grupo B:**

  * **Nova Zelândia**: Kieran Read (Nº 8), Sevu Reece (""wing"")
 * **África do Sul**: Siya Kolisi (""flanker""), Herschel Jantjies (""scrumhalf"")
 * **Itália**: Sergio Parisse (Nº 8, ""flanker""), Mattia Bellini (""wing"")
 * **Canadá**: Tyler Ardron (Nº 8), Jeff Hassler (""wing"")
 * **Namíbia**: Renaldo Bothma (""flanker""), Justin Newman (""center"")
  ### Grupo C

 **Inglaterra (3), França (8), Argentina (11), Estados Unidos (13), Tonga (15)**  
 Os Estados Unidos vêm recuperando o atraso com relação à elite do rúgbi mundial, mas os USA Eagles caíram em um grupo que certamente merece o apelido de Grupo da Morte. A Inglaterra, terceira do ranking mundial, está jogando de novo como candidata séria ao título, e a França rejuvenesceu seu time e parece perigosa; ainda que os resultados recentes da Argentina venham sendo decepcionantes, a seleção tem muitos talentos de classe internacional e foi semifinalista da Copa do Mundo de Rúgbi de 2015. Mesmo Tonga tem a capacidade de derrubar um time grande ocasionalmente.

 Mesmo assim, os Estados Unidos jogaram bem na recente Copa das Nações do Pacífico e, desde que o ""flyhalf"" A.J. MacGinty se recupere de uma lesão no tornozelo sofrida no primeiro tempo de um jogo contra o Japão, os Eagles devem disputar fortemente todos os jogos, e talvez vençam um ou dois deles. Mas parece improvável que vençam dois dos três times que estão acima deles no ranking, em seu grupo, para conseguir classificação.

 Dado o desempenho recente da equipe, e com talentos internacionais como Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje, Billy Vunipola e Courtney Lawes todos em boa forma,é difícil imaginar outra seleção que não a Inglaterra vencendo o grupo.

 **Jogadores a observar no Grupo C:**

  * **Inglaterra**: Maro Itoje (""lock""), Joe Cokanasiga (""wing"")
 * **França**: Louis Picamoles (""flanker"", Nº 8), Maxime Médard (""fullback"")
 * **Argentina**: Pablo Matera (""flanker""), Emiliano Boffelli (""wing"")
 * **Estados Unidos**: Malon Al-Jiboori (""flanker""), A.J. MacGinty (""flyhalf"")
 * **Tonga**: Paea Fa’anunu (""prop""), Siale Piutau (""center"")
  ### Grupo D

 **País de Gales (5), Austrália (6), Fiji (9), Geórgia (12) e Uruguai (19)**  
 O Grupo D deve ser uma corrida entre duas seleções pelas quartas de final, com o País de Gales como favorito do grupo e a Austrália preparada para avançar. O país de Gales conta especialmente com o avanço, depois de um ano em que venceu o Six Nations sem derrotas e recentemente conquistou o primeiro posto do ranking mundial (por algum tempo), derrubando o All Blacks.

 Mas os galeses e australianos não devem subestimar Fiji, que tem muitos corredores rápidos e fortes, hábeis em descarregar a bola e marcar pontos em jogadas longas de contra-ataque. Fiji é uma força dominante na versão do rúgbi para se",1

162,2019-09-20 16:02:25+00:00," Em seu nono disco, lançado na última semana, o paraibano [Chico César](https://guia.folha.uol.com.br/shows/2019/06/chico-cesar-faz-show-e-bate-papo-com-o-publico-no-sesc-guarulhos.shtml), 55, apresenta sugestivas opções para se lidar com as trevas. “Pedrada” e “Eu Quero Quebrar” são algumas das novas canções.

 A insurreição principal proposta pelo músico, no entanto, e que dá título ao álbum, vem de um caminho muito mais pacífico, e que permeia seus 25 anos de carreira: o afeto.

 “O Amor É um Ato Revolucionário” pretende rebelar por meio da arte. “Os agentes da nossa época querem acabar com a dança, com o beijo e com a poesia. Então, quanto mais a gente dançar, beijar e fizer poesia, mais subversivo a gente vai ser. Se só ficar fazendo passeata pela dança, pelo beijo e pela poesia, é sinal de que eles ganharam”, diz o músico.

 Mas quem são “eles”? “Esses que querem dizer como o amor deve ser. [Doria](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2019/09/doria-manda-recolher-material-que-cita-identidade-de-genero-e-fala-em-apologia.shtml), [Crivella](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/09/marcelo-crivella-manda-censurar-gibis-dos-vingadores-na-bienal-do-livro-no-rio.shtml), [Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/bolsonaro-diz-que-seu-filho-carlos-falou-o-obvio-em-mensagem-sobre-democracia.shtml). Só que a sociedade avançou muito nos últimos tempos, e isso não vai acontecer. Os negros não aceitam voltar para a senzala, as mulheres não aceitam voltar para a cozinha e os gays não aceitam voltar para o armário”.

 Para Chico, existem atualmente “muitas barreiras externas” que dificultam a criação. Mas, por considerar que é o papel do artista “procurar novas fronteiras”, debruçou-se sobre o papel logo após o lançamento do disco anterior, “Estado de Poesia”, em 2015, para construir o novo trabalho. 

 “Comecei a perceber muito antes do discurso de [Bolsonaro louvando ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/11/1830577-bolsonaro-diz-que-ustra-e-heroi-em-sessao-de-seu-processo-de-cassacao.shtml)[Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/11/1830577-bolsonaro-diz-que-ustra-e-heroi-em-sessao-de-seu-processo-de-cassacao.shtml) que a sociedade brasileira caminhava para um lugar muito escuro. A vida político-social do Brasil foi ficando nervosa, já havia a presença agressiva da [bancada do boi, da bíblia e da bala](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/12/bancadas-tematicas-tem-influencia-limitada-sobre-votos-de-parlamentares.shtml) querendo tomar o poder.""

 ""Eu já havia criticado o modo [como o Partido dos Trabalhadores lidava com a natureza](https://temas.folha.uol.com.br/projeto-amazonia/hidreletricas/prestes-a-ser-concluida-belo-monte-e-criticada-por-atingidos-e-especialistas.shtml), mas tive um pressentimento de que o viria pela frente seria muito mais pesado.”

 Quando apresentou em seu perfil do Instagram uma prévia do reggae “Pedrada”, antes do lançamento do novo disco, Chico enfrentou ameaças de opositores. Com um refrão que incita “fogo nos fascistas”, a música teve uma repercussão rápida.

 “Gente da chamada nova direita divulgou o vídeo no Facebook dizendo que tinham que me prender. Que não podiam mais me contratar para as prefeituras, que deviam me boicotar nas festas, e ir aos meus shows para agredir e impedir as pessoas de me escutar. Eu denunciei, porque não queria minha música associada àquela página."" 

 O músico acredita que, a princípio, a reação de quem escuta a faixa é de incredulidade. “Eles esperam que a gente fique só dançando ciranda no Largo da Batata, enquanto eles vão à Câmara e tiram os direitos trabalhistas. Daí vem esse povo paz e amor e diz uma coisa dessas.”

 Ele diz, no entanto, que não se trata de um convite literal. “Fogo nos fascistas obviamente não tem sentido estrito, fechado. É fogo com a nossa poesia, com a nossa visão de mundo, com o nosso afeto. Mas, se for necessário, é fogo mesmo, com coquetel molotov, greve, paralisações, sabotagem do sistema, parar as máquinas. Desobediência civil é fogo nos fascistas."" 

 Autor de sucessos como “À Primeira Vista” e “Pensar em Você”, Chico segue louvando o feminino em “O Amor É um Ato Revolucionário”. O novo disco traz homenagens às mulheres como “Mulhero”, “De Peito Aberto” e “Minha Morena”, escrita para sua companheira, a atriz Bárbara Santos.

 Importantes tributos em uma época em que, mesmo com todos os progressos da luta feminista, a [violência contra a mulher](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/09/brasil-registra-1-caso-de-agressao-a-mulher-a-cada-4-minutos-mostra-levantamento.shtml) escala a níveis preocupantes.

 “Quando um governo retira coisas que já havíamos conquistado, ele autoriza de certa forma atitudes mais selvagens e primitivas do macho. Quando você tem governantes que [se referem à primeira-dama de um país como ‘feia’](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/08/apos-ofender-mulher-de-macron-bolsonaro-diz-que-nao-a-ofendeu.shtml), e isso é [corroborado pelo ministro da Economia que diz ‘é feia mesmo’](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/09/ela-e-feia-mesmo-diz-guedes-sobre-mulher-de-presidente-da-franca.shtml), fica parecendo que um tipo de homem tem total liberdade para opinar a qualquer hora sobre como as mulheres devem ser.”

 “Isso vai dando poder para que aquele sujeito que você acha que é normal possa exercer seu lado psicopata e matar uma namorada, a ex-esposa, a família inteira do namorado da filha porque não gosta dele.”

 Chico define a sociedade atual como “precária”, do ponto de vista das relações, e “contraditória”, já que o momento é de mulheres na rua e no comando. “Não é à toa que atiraram na cara de [Marielle](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/denunciado-no-caso-marielle-coloca-apadrinhado-na-chefia-da-assembleia-do-rio.shtml)”.

 “O Amor É um Ato Revolucionário” traz “verdades inconvenientes”, entre elas o chamado a um mea culpa em todas as instâncias e que, para Chico, é fundamental no caminho para restaurar o cenário político. O artista provoca, por exemplo, quem, “com seu voto, ajudou a acender a fagulha” na Amazônia. “Agora vai lá na passeata na Vieira Souto e diz ‘olha, está pegando fogo’. Claro, meu amor, você soprou as brasas”. 

 E por todas as instâncias entenda-se também a própria imprensa, que teria tentado erroneamente “contemporizar e ser República”. “Bolsonaro não pensa a República, ele pensa o quartel. Depois daquele discurso defendendo Ustra, ele deveria ter sido duramente criticado por todo mundo. Num país minimamente civilizado, ele teria saído dali preso.”

 “Eu quero colocar meu filho na embaixada americana, vou colocar e pronto: isso é uma monarquia. Nem Saddam Hussein fez isso, [botar o filho na diplomacia em ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/07/eduardo-bolsonaro-diz-ter-apoio-do-chanceler-e-que-ja-fritou-hamburguer-nos-eua.shtml)Nova York. O Brasil foi caminhando para um lugar em que o único objetivo parecia ser tirar o PT. Tá, mas colocar o quê? Agora a gente vê onde está.”

 Chico se define como “um cidadão a mais, em um tempo de cidadania ameaçada”. Entende como solução a [soltura de Lula](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/04/lula-e-preso.shtml), “com todos os seus direitos políticos restituídos”, a cassação de Jair Bolsonaro e a convocação de eleições diretas. “Os militares precisam sair dessa enrascada que este aventureiro os meteu.”

 “Esperei muito uma manifestação republicana no segundo turno de Ciro, Marina, FHC, achei que todos iam marchar junto com Haddad. Mas decidiram não se misturar e esperar quatro anos. Por isso é importante que a sociedade civil marche junta, senão fica cada um defendendo a sua coisinha. A gente precisa ir de bolo, todo mundo junto. Dizer ‘vamos pelo amor’, e ir mesmo.”

164,2019-09-20 01:01:32+00:00,"This is rediculous an really doesn't do justice to actual addictions. A opioid makes a person feel better often for a specific ailment. My they got it because they broke their shoulder. But hey, look at that, back pain's gone... Feeling warm, fuzzy, like you got the world's deepest hug...

And you kind of start realizing how unwell you feel. Your bones are healed, but your back? Maybe another one, there's 30 doses in the bottle after all...

Then, suddenly you start to feel bad without them. You're condition's no worse off, but you feel bad. You take another. The feeling's gone. It comes back, you take another to chase it away. It comes back quicker, you ward it off with two.

It's utterly insideous. Doctors should be comfortable to prescribe what they want. But the fact that drug company schmooze up to doctors with fancy lunches and little perks/bribes is an ass kissing practice that costs people their lives. My 95 lb mother got 60 oxycodine, after she crushed a disc in her neck. It was oxycontin, produced by Perdue pharm. The first one was enough to send her into hallucinatory fits and we had the rest of the prescription properly disposed of. The fact she did fine without it and it had such a dramatic effect on her is enough of a case of it's own that the drug is dangerous and that alternatives should be considered first.",1

Mom was a oxy popper and dad was a cocaine addict. One of my uncles is currently heavily addicted to crystal Methamphetamine. Most of my friends became addicted to cocaine or heroin. I myself had a rough upbringing so I used cocaine to raise my self esteem and confidence because my parents bent me so bad I was mentally fucked and would get panic attacks in public. Cocaine got me laid many times, it made me friends. It made me to the person I always wanted. By age 17 I couldn’t stop. No one knew I was an addict or even used coke for that matter. Then one day I dropped 1500ug of LSD and had my world rocked so fucking hard. Kicked cocaine like it was nothing after that. Psychedelics and THC are the only drugs people should use when they feel emotional pain. Trust me anything else will only make things worse. I overdosed on Oxycotin once and literally died for 2 min.

When the media talks about fentenyl causing OD deaths, they are talking about illicit fentenyl made in other countries and smuggled in, not prescription from drs. Not only are the vast majority of OD deaths attributed to these ILLICIT opioids (not the same as prescription opioids) but as soon as their drug of choice is no longer so easily accessible, they will switch to something else.

185,2019-09-18 15:52:10+00:00,"I just watched the video clips of Aaron Carter on ""The Doctors"" and...oh. my. gawd.

To get even ONE prescription for a benzo (for panick attacks/anxiety) in my city - the most you can be prescribed is 30 tablets for 30 days - the smallest dose tablet (.5mg) AND it's closely monitored by the pharmacies and physicians... If you ask for a refill before the 30 days are up or if you visit a different doctor and ask for benzos - you are flagged. And no doctor will prescribe you a benzo for at least 6 months. BUT in those vids of Aaron Carter on ""The Doctors"" - he has 3 huge bottles of benzos (Xanax, klonopin, Lorazepam) that looks like about 3 years worth of benzos... never mind 30 days smh.

In my area, most doctors won't even prescribe any type of opioid pain killer unless you're literally dying (end of life care) or if you've had a traumatic injury (gun shot, broken bones) or a very invasive surgery. Up here, the strongest pain killer most people are prescribed is Tylenol3. Fentenyl is pretty much illegal now. But Aaron had opiates and fentenyl in his system, along with 3 types of benzos and marijuana. 

Are his physicians trying to kill him?? Shouldn't his medication and prescription history be visible to every doctor he visits, so they don't over medicate him... he's clearly in pain and self-medicating. But his doctors are basically prescribing him the same cocktail that killed Heath Ledger and many other people. Even if he's buying the opiates illegally, all the other medications he's being prescribed and taking daily - are a recipe for disaster. 

You're right - He's been through alot. Apparently abused by his manager when he was a child and abandoned by his parents. This kid needs help and intense in-patient treatment, before he hurts himself or someone else.

188,2019-09-18 12:08:45+00:00,"I'm going through an extended period of hernia related sciatica (it's the second time, last time was in 2016 and it lasted 5 months or so). This time it started back in April and has been getting progressively worse ever since. For the first couple of months I'd been able to do some fysio, yoga, nerve gliding, etc. but it didn't really make a difference. The painmedication (naproxen, tramadol and oxycodon) barely helped and there's not a single position releaving the pain. I'm more or less immobile by now, waiting for an MRI. It's pretty exhausting.

Out of despair I started experimenting with different medicines and 2/3 months ago I was able to acquire a couple of Prednisone 30mg tablets. I used a 12 hour shedule and took 30mg/15mg/15mg/7.5mg/7.5mg/7.5mg/7.5mg/. The result was very remarkable and the pain became a lot less for a 2-3 days after. I was able to repeat this for two more short periods with similar results.

So I started nagging my doctor for a prescription. They were very reluctant but after numerous visits, calls and writing a long letter they let me try it for a couple of weeks. It was the only time I felt relief and was able to stand up straight, legs together and without tilting my pelvis in some weird way. I could sit on the toilet again. I even quit the oxycodon and tramadol for a week.

I figured the way it works is something like this; the bulging or ruptured disc irritates the nerve and starts an inflamation. As a result there's swelling alongside the nerve which irritates it even further making the inflamation travel down en expand (so even putting a little pressure on your cheek will have you up against the ceiling). With the prednisone this inflamation is somewhat tempered and build up fluids removed, lessening the pressure on the nerve and releaving some of the pain.

With the tramadol/oxycodone it is obvious it just throws a bit of a blanket over the pain. But with the prednisone it feels as if part of the cause for the pain is remedied. It really felt different, better.

Sadly they wouldn't renew my prescription. I'm still fighting for it though. You might want to try it too, ask your doctor about it.",1

193,2019-09-18 07:23:51+00:00,"Spain went from an extremely strict policy towards drug use to an aggressive and ultimately successful [harm reduction approach](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3605010/). Spain was one of the first countries in the world to decriminalize drug consumption, but it's harm reduction policies were very late to be implimented and only were after the heroin epidemic of the 1980s.

In major cities, rather than ""sweeping the problem under the rug"" as other users have suggested is the policy, there exist spaces to safely use drugs called *narcosalas*, although the term can also be used for illegal ""shooting galleries"" as well. [These *narcosalas*](https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/madrid/2017-08-15/madrid-droga-sanidad-centro-ambulatorio-cocaina-heroina-jovenes_1428897/) have greatly reduced the visible and less visible impacts of drug addiction, but funding has been reduced since the *crisis* began and the ""Ley Mordaza"" enacted a few years ago is more repressive (and regressive) on drug use.

In terms of homelessness, there are at least two main factors to consider. One, the ""family responsibility"", meaning that parents are responsibly for their children's welfare until the child has become financially independent. So except in certain extreme cases, children have a home regardless of their relationship with their parents even after they are well into adulthood. Despite the extremely high unemployment Spaniards under 30, homelessness among this demographic is minimal.

The second element is that in Spain an individual is legally entitled to housing (along with education and healthcare). Thus regional and local government have policies requiring developers to included subsidizes housing for low-income individuals and families when new housing is constructed. Furthermore, these flats are typically sold not rented and can be resold at a subsidized rate or much later at market value. Unfortunately, construction of these *pisos de protección oficial* was greatly reduced during the *crisis*.

Finally, Spain has one of the world's most inclusive and effective public health schemes which greatly reduces the impact of mental (and physical) health issues on drug addiction and homelessness.",1

I watch the Hotboxing with Mike Tyson and just see how much of a different person he is, though I know he's experienced quite a lot of drugs, so it probably wasn't as hard of a choice for him to make, but he sure is a different person.   But I'd like to make sure that at least my first experience with psychedelics is a good one.  I grew up in AZ, and had a friend that lived on the reservation and he had access to peyote.   I lived in Oregon for 15 years, and knew where to go in Astoria to get magic mushrooms.  Now I live in Vegas (similar to AZ).   But, I do try to research as much as possible.  In the past I was on/off the oxycontin, morphine, percacets, etc.   almost committed suicide a couple times as I went through withdrawals coming off of those drugs, when they stopped working.  Dr. didn't really do anything to ween me off, so I went cold turkey.  Anyways, after finding cannabis, I can manage my pain levels.  But with doctors, insurance companies, etc.. You really don't know who to trust anymore.  I could have easily been a statistic for the oxycontin crisis, fortunately I wasn't, but I'm dealing with a lot of problems from it.   So I'm trusting others that have had an experience with something, and researching to find what things could work for me, not only that, but I do want to experience some cool stuff, even if I wasn't dealing with issues, I think I would still be interested in some of these experiences.  Just trying to live life to the fullest, have as much fun as possible.  Psychedelics is something I've been afraid of in the past, when I was younger, but now growing older, I'm more interested in trying and living the experience, as safely as I can.",1

204,2019-09-17 15:03:17+00:00,"&gt; Besides the Circus Maximus, there were at Rome still other Circi, among which the most celebrated was the Circus Flaminius in the ninth region, Varr. L.

207,2019-09-17 08:03:05+00:00,"None of these are the policies we need really. The feds do not have control over that many of the direct policies which HELP with the fentenyl crisis. NOTE: suing  drug companies does not, DIRECTLY, prevent an addict from ODing. Most of what can directly be done is PROVINCIAL juristidction is provincial. EG fentanyl regulation and tracking, naloxone programs; anything done on the municipal level, is ususlaly extended from the provincial level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Areas of EXCLUSIVE federal control are:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Imports:

Crack down on imports of fentanyl from china

\- Criminal Code reform

Whatever is makes it better, but criminal code is federal juristiction

\- International enforcement

Work with international law enforcement to shutdown smuggling rings and prevent fentenyl from getting here

\- Safety regulation and Drug Approval

Regulate all future pain-relief drugs for cancer in the future that are like fentanyl have some form of anti tamper property if possible/are only made in canada/some solution. Again, this is an area where parties should be focusing on, because it is an area where the federal government can actually be the ONLY one who can do something.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of proposed solutions are either not doing something proactive with federal power about the problem aka lawsuits, which anyone can launch or are throwing money to the provinces to do something, which again, is not really proper when you are running for  federal government",1
208,2019-09-17 07:44:24+00:00,"Fentanyl is legal, it's regularly used as a painkiller for cancer patients. 

Now if you're talking about recreational fentanyl that's a whole different ball game.  

Why dont we hold off before we try that? Given how its \[very difficult to predict what a lethal dose is\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl#Adverse\_effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl#Adverse_effects)), but that if you get it wrong, it can enter a feedback loop as they OD. Their breathing decreases, and the oxygen in their blood goes down. The lower blood oxygen causes more fentenyl to bond to opoid receptors, which makes them breathe slower. That lowers blood O2 even lower, etc. This feedback loop makes them crash very suddenly without warning. Unless naloxone is onhand, it is very hard to get them back. Lethal dose is ROUGHLY 2mg. I dont want my tax payer dollars funding anything which is going to come that close to killing someone, bc 2 mg is a very fine line, and the levels of tolerances some addicts can develop is very high. It can also change very rapidly, without them realizing it. That is when ODs happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I would rather the money be put to naloxone kits on every corner, and cancer pain control which is tamper proof so that dealers are not extracting the fentenyl from it to sell on the streets. Unfortunately, while people focus on chinese imports, dead grandmas fentenyl pills and patches are often a source of the drug",1

210,2019-09-16 23:32:50+00:00,"Its money they made selling drugs to desperate people. I'd wager *most* prescriptions for OxyContin weren't even to people with any real chronic pain. It was all a facade and they owe it back to society, they were drug dealers, not just a run of the mill pharma company. Bit of a conspiracy, but OxyContin was almost formulated FOR abuse. You can crush it so easily, so you can eat it as instant release with enough opiates to kill a naive user in a single easily crushable 80mg pill meant for a dependent person to be slowly released over 8 hours or so. You could crush it up more and snort it. You could NOT crush it, throw it on foil and it would slide along the foil BETTER than heroin. And of course, you could shoot it, with zero issues. Most XR/CR opiates do not absorb well into water, they turn into waxy/thick gunk (MScontin - morphine) OR be made of beads that are pretty much as hard as concrete (hydromorphone XR). There's some ways around this even with those, but it takes a lot more effort, and those pills definitely don't smoke or snort well. So they'd only allow users to crush and eat as an IR pill, or do a bunch of research and jump all the way to shooting up. Most people will not go from oral use straight to shooting up, especially shooting up a pill that takes a lot of effort to do it properly and if you don't you clog up your veins with waxy gunk, there's always a long stage of snorting/smoking in between, well almost always, I'm sure there's exceptions..

OxyContin was an enigma pretty much.",1

214,2019-09-16 20:30:42+00:00,"You don't know how taxes work huh? The majority of the NHS is paid for with corporation tax, VAT, and so on. Of course some of that comes from taxes on monthly wages, but it's a small amount in comparison to all the other sources of income the government has. The cost of running a hospital might be the same, but once you introduce an insurance company as a middle man, it suddenly becomes far more expensive. A nationalized system simply skips that step.

The data I posted shows what the NHS pays for pharmaceuticals, not what they charge patients. This is to simply show that they don't actually have to pay a huge amount for medicines, whereas the Insurance Companies and hospitals of the US will charge massive amounts for exactly the same products. I very much doubt that you could find a hospital or insurance company in the US which would compete with the £9 per item fee *or* the baseline cost of the medicine.

The US also has real problems with Pharma companies pushing their brand. Oxycotin is a really good example. We simply don't have Oxy here, and no Opiate epidemic as a result.

Since you don't know the game is rigged you keep on trying because your addictive nature leads you down that path. The entire amusement park is set up to draw you in with flashing lights and ""easy wins"" but then you have a mental health issue with addiction and you can't help but want to win the biggest stuffed animal on the wall. 

Amusement parks are set up like that and most people know they are a scam, but they still come back every year and make a lot of money. Scopely on the other hand has set up it's tents in your pocket and is constantly there dinging at you reminding you of how your team sucks, and how you could just maybe spend a few dollars and get (insert toon here) with the latest (insert capability here). Now, again, that's not the issue, the issue is the lying about the odds, so not only are they preying on the weakest among us, they are also deceiving them on top of this. Similar to how the Sackler Family lied to the public about the addictive capabilities of oxycotin. 

To your note about stopping the cashflow in the next cycle, I hear you, but that can only last for a few months, every toon they come out with is obsolete soon enough. 

For me I think the end will come when I am not able to get the latest free toon as a F2P guy with only a few coins from my monthly. I was very close to not getting Piper, then even closer to not getting Sergio, if I can't get this Zhu fella for free, then I am going to quit.

There is a huge difference between a person responsibly taking necessary medication, who is supported by a team of doctors- versus a drug addict binging on heroin, oxy or fentynyl. 

It's not nearly as much the opiod that is the risk; it's who and how they are using it while pregnant. 

My doctors (maternal fetal medicine, a high risk ob, pain management specialists and those managing my Ehlers Danlos Syndrome)- have all been clear that extensive pain is far more dangerous to a developing fetus than the morphine I have to take every 12 hours. 

Just wanted to throw that $.02 in. 

There's always a lot of negativity surrounding opiods, but for some of us- they make a life changing difference and we would have no quality of life without them. Thanks to endless joint subluxations and dislocations (especially my hips,ribs, knees) from EDS; before the extended release Morphine &amp; Dilaudid combo I've now been on for 8 years, I was unable to walk for over a year.

13 people with my condition have committed suicide in the last 18 months thanks to an inability to access adequate (or any) pain management.

The least amount would have been 2 or so hydrocodone), smoked pot (a lot of freaking pot. Most was 28 blunts from 5pm till 12am, for my uncles birthday) simultaneously every single day, and anti depressants with a few months of h (maxed at a gram a day) and a few months of Ice ($20-$60 or so a day). Both sessions with those were every day as well on top of the others, but when I quit this time I didn’t have one withdrawal symptom and I totally should have.

We don't even know if those bottles had anything in them! So to say Shanann had bottles of oxy laying around the house is probably not true and has yet to be proven.

The only mention in the Discovery (outside toxicology reports) was a search Chris did on his phone for ""80mg Oxycodon."" The search was undated and deleted. So I would imagine, just like the ""shadow"" video Chris now has that information. The reason for that search is known only to Chris and he's a lying liar.

The redness appears randomly. It covers the middle of my face with big patches of red that sometimes have smaller patches of dark purple at the center. My ears usually get the worst of it, turning crimson red and getting really hot. It doesn’t usually get too much worse than what you see in the photo.

On my lower back, I have a small patch of morphea. Even though it doesn’t feel or look the same as the redness on my face, I wanted to confirm it wasn’t spreading to my face and rule out autoimmune diseases, so I had my doctor do a full blood panel on me. When I expressed my concerns to him, he said that there’s no reason to see a dermatologist about the morphea since it would’ve spread by now since it appeared when I was a kid. He also said that my inflammation markers weren’t elevated, meaning it’s not an autoimmune diseases. Is that true?

I really want to find out what this is, but I have no idea what to do at this point. I’m so fed up with doctors disregarding what I say. I know how I feel, but my GP says I’m too young and healthy to be worried about chronic illness or autoimmune diseases. They run in my family and I’ve seen how serious they can be. It’s not something I want to mess with, so I prefer to find it early and address it before it gets bad.

Passou 45 minutos calado. Se aquele time do Internacional, campeão brasileiro de 1975, achava que o esquema tático era rígido demais, podiam atuar como como quisessem.

 No intervalo, o clube gaúcho perdia por 2 a 0.

 “Vamos combinar uma coisa? Com a bola, façam o que vocês quiserem. Sem a bola, façam o que eu mando!”, pediu o treinador.

 O placar final foi 3 a 2 para o Inter.

 Em seu apartamento próximo à avenida Paulista, em São Paulo, Minelli se diverte ao contar histórias como essa. Às vezes ele perde a linha de raciocínio, mas as lembranças fluem, assim como as opiniões de quem passa os dias assistindo às partidas pela televisão. A última vez que esteve em um estádio de futebol aconteceu em janeiro. Foi homenageado pelo [Palmeiras](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/palmeiras/), o clube onde, meio sem querer, começou a carreira.

 Quatro vezes campeão brasileiro por três clubes diferentes e revolucionário tático do futebol nacional, Minelli continua curioso. Todo esse interesse faz com que perca a paciência. Seja com a qualidade dos jogos ou com as queixas dos treinadores do país pela chegada de profissionais do exterior.

 “O futebol está feio, não é? É uma mesmice muito grande. Sem falar na violência, falta de respeito. Aí você olha o futebol europeu e é tudo totalmente diferente. Veja os jogos do [Campeonato Inglês](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/03/livro-sobre-premier-league-relata-revolucao-nos-direitos-de-tv-no-futebol.shtml). Parece que os jogadores estão lutando por um prato de comida. Aqui o atleta recebe a bola e não tem ninguém perto. Marcação é antes de o jogador receber a bola, não depois”, reclama.

 “O problema dos técnicos brasileiros é que antigamente eles tinham mercado e trabalhavam no exterior. Hoje não tem mais. E para completar, os estrangeiros chegaram e estão na frente no [Brasileiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2019/campeonato-brasileiro/serie-a/)”, lembra, citando o português [Jorge Jesus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/06/portugues-jorge-jesus-e-o-novo-tecnico-do-flamengo.shtml), do líder Flamengo, e o argentino [Jorge Sampaoli](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/08/sampaoli-trabalha-como-um-manager-e-dita-regras-no-santos.shtml), do segundo colocado [Santos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/santos/).

 Entre os campeões nacionais, apenas [Vanderlei Luxemburgo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/vasco-anuncia-acerto-com-o-tecnico-vanderlei-luxemburgo.shtml) e Lula (cinco conquistas cada) venceram mais do que Minelli, ganhador em 1969 (Palmeiras), 1975, 1976 (ambos pelo Internacional) e 1977 ([São Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/saopaulo/)).

 A memória não trai o veterano técnico para lembrar como suas equipes jogavam ou o quanto trabalhava. Os jogos, treinos e viagens para observar adversários fizeram com que perdesse os oito primeiros aniversários de sua filha. Anotava as informações em cadernetas, várias ainda existentes. Em época sem computadores, ser metódico o fez montar banco de dados de esquemas preferidos pelos outros treinadores e características de atletas que lhe davam vantagens em confrontos futuros.

 As viagens de férias à Espanha eram usadas para renovar a biblioteca com livros sobre futebol, uma paixão tardia de Rubens Francisco Minelli, formado em Economia e ponta de carreira discreta. Funcionário dos Correios, foi chamado para trabalhar nas divisões de base do Palmeiras por Canhotinho, ex-ponta esquerda que havia conhecido o treinador quando este comandava times da Faculdade de Ciências da USP (Universidade de São Paulo).

 “Canhotinho me ensinou como deve ser uma preleção. Curta, porque senão o jogador dorme na cadeira”, diz.

 O técnico paulista pode ser apontado como o mais vencedor da história do futebol nacional a não ter dirigido a [seleção brasileira](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/selecaobrasileira/). Ele era a unanimidade em 1977, quando [Oswaldo Brandão](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/livrariadafolha/2014/07/1472403-jornalista-conta-a-historia-do-tecnico-oswaldo-brandao-heroi-do-corinthians-e-do-palmeiras.shtml), um dos seus mestres, foi demitido. Seu discípulo era bicampeão brasileiro pelo Internacional. Naquele ano, conquistaria o tri, mas pelo São Paulo. Era o nome mais comentado do país.

 A então CBD (Confederação Brasileira de Desportos) escolheu o preparador físico Claudio Coutinho, que tinha pequena experiência como técnico, nenhum título conquistado e comandava o Flamengo. Minelli perdeu a chance de ir à Copa do Mundo de 1978, na Argentina. .

 Era a época em que ele estava na moda por causa do seu Internacional de inovações táticas, como o triângulo no meio-campo. Dupla de volantes formava a base da pirâmide no ataque quando o time tinha a bola. Na marcação, dois ficavam na defesa. A peça móvel era [Paulo Roberto Falcão](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2016/07/1791157-paulo-roberto-falcao-e-anunciado-como-novo-tecnico-do-internacional.shtml). Os adversários não tinham resposta para essa novidade.

 Também não sabiam como superar a linha de impedimento. Foi com o Minelli que o futebol brasileiro viu pela primeira vez um time sair em bloco da área para deixar os rivais em condição ilegal.

 “Eu copiei isso da Juventus, da Itália. Mas aqui ninguém sabia que existia. Comecei a treinar e deu certo”, afirma.

 Funcionou no Inter. Ele cai na gargalhada ao lembrar que tentou o mesmo ao chegar no [São Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/saopaulo/), mas não teve sucesso porque havia uma palavra-chave para que os jogadores saíssem em linha para deixar o adversário em impedimento. Geralmente era “curió” porque Minelli criava a ave. No Morumbi, o responsável por comandar o movimento era Gilberto Sorriso. Todos os jogadores saíam ao grito do lateral. Menos o próprio Gilberto.

 Aposentado há 20 anos, o técnico continua como referência. Convidado para ir à Academia de Futebol do Palmeiras em 2017, passou longo tempo trocando ideias com [Roger Machado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/05/preconceito-no-futebol-e-velado-assim-como-na-sociedade-diz-roger.shtml), então treinador da equipe. Foi chamado para dar palestra aos jogadores da seleção durante a [Copa de 2014](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2013/folhanacopa/). Contou a eles a história de quando pensou em contratar [Luiz Felipe Scolari ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/09/palmeiras-demite-felipao-por-desempenho-pos-copa-america.shtml)para o Internacional porque o zagueiro tinha a liderança que o elenco precisava.

 Não fechou negócio. Preferiu Marinho Peres, nome que sempre aparecia nas convocações para a seleção. Mas citou jogo contra o Caxias em que Felipão foi para o ataque nos acréscimos em um escanteio e chamou todos os seus companheiros para a área buscar o empate. O Inter fez a linha do impedimento e dez jogadores do Caxias ficaram impedidos.

 “Agora você me f..., hein?”, lhe cochichou Scolari, ao ver os atletas rindo em 2014 com a história.

 Campeão gaúcho pelo Grêmio em 1985, Minelli também chegou a ser cotado para substituir Evaristo de Macedo na seleção. A CBF contratou [Telê Santana](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/07/tele-foi-de-euforia-a-decepcao-e-sofreu-com-maradona-na-copa-de-94.shtml).

 “O Grêmio só foi campeão em 1985 porque o [Renato Gaúcho ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/07/nao-entendo-por-que-gay-no-futebol-e-noticia-mundial-diz-renato-gaucho.shtml)operou o joelho e ficou 60 dias afastado. Naquele período ganhamos o título. Ele era uma merda para o grupo”, detona Minelli.

 Daí surge a sua maior queixa no futebol. Algo que já existia na sua época mas que hoje, avalia, está em níveis insuportáveis: o jogador que deseja mandar na equipe. Ele desanda a contar histórias da época de Renato, que pensava ser diferente de todos os outros. 

 Minelli acredita ser imperdoável o astro que não se sacrifica pelo grupo. E quando teve chances de agir com relação a isso, não pensou duas vezes. Uma das vítimas foi o meia uruguaio Pedro Rocha, um dos maiores craques da história do São Paulo, em 1977.

 “Eu falei para a diretoria que com o Pedro Rocha não ganharíamos nada. Ele não marcava ninguém. Sem ele, fomos campeões brasileiros. Graças a Deus nunca fui técnico do [Sócrates](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2011/socrates/) e do [Rivellino](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2013/05/1282857-ha-40-anos-rivelino-vivia-situacao-parecida-com-a-de-neymar.shtml) também. Sempre jogaram para eles, não para o time”, recorda.

 A pergunta é inevitável para quem acompanha tão de perto o futebol atual e tem tanta experiência: e [Neymar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/09/aos-27-anos-neymar-ouve-nao-pela-primeira-vez-na-carreira.shtml)?

 “É um jogador estragado pelo pai, que botou na cabeça do filho que este tem de ser malandro. Só que ele virou um malandro-trouxa.”

 A visão do futebol de Rubens Minelli é pragmática. Defendida também pelo mesmo Renato Gaúcho que ele sempre achou prejudicial para a união do elenco de jogadores. Técnico bom é aquele que ganha campeonatos. O resto é conversa fiada.

 “Mas meus times sempre procuraram mostrar futebol. Com a bola, os jogadores sempre tinham liberdade para se express",1

They had to give him fentinyl, and wait for it to kick in before moving him, and he still needed a laughing gas top up for the ambulance ride.

I'm his mom, and spent the 2 hours with one hand behind his neck and one bracing his middle. The delay I believe was 1) getting an ambulance from the children's hospital rather than the nearest one and 2) the accident happened just before 5pm, so peak rush hour traffic. There's no doubt I'm raging about the fact - I think they should gave at least sent the nearest firefighters to do triage while we waited. The ambulance is the only part of his care I have issues with. The staff and fellow riders at the stables and the hospital afterwards both did everything they could for him.

287,2019-09-12 17:00:18+00:00,"La legalización parece ser el camino correcto para intentar encauzar los problemas del narcotráfico: al dejar que el estado regule el producto se supone que el tráfico ilegal disminuye, sin embargo la realidad es mucho, mucho mas complicada.

Dejar que la gente se meta cualquier cosa no es normalmente lo que hacen los gobiernos: recuerda que el objeto de un gobierno es manejar un conjunto de gente, propender por una buena vida, sana, con alegrias y permitiendo que la gente sea libre, que haga lo que quiera, etc. todo lo que dicen la mayoría de constituciones del mundo. Esto implica tomar decisiones que a algunos no les gustan como las prohibiciones. Es labor del legislador decidir cuales se prohiben y cuales no. Y el legislador es la suma de todos nosotros: jovenes, estudiantes menores de edad, niños, bebés, hijos que están por nacer, madres, padres, abuelos, etc. 

Por encima de lo que piense cada uno de nosotros hay que tener en cuenta, de manera respestuosa que no todo el mundo tiene la misma idea acerca del impacto de las drogas: unos se criaron con imagenes de degradación por las drogas y no quieren acercarse a 10 metros de lo que consideran droga, otros creen que un porro no es nada y otros juran y rejuran y consideran que tienen el derecho sagrado a meterse una pepa de extasis en plena clase.

Sumale que las drogas hoy ilegales son ... mas perjudiciales que el alcohol y el tabaco de acuerdo a multiples estudios. Entonces, como sociedad, como legislador, como aprobar venderle a la gente productos que afectan su vida ? el pais se compone de jovenes y adultos sanos mayoritariamente. Has visto Idiocracy ? es una parodia pero indica, de una manera exagerada claro, lo que pasa si no se cuida la salud de sociedad actual .

Como consecuencia obvia entonces algunos responden con molestia a la posibilidad de legalizar. Otros no quieren saber nada al respecto, otros reaccionan con rabia, otros con desprecio, otros con alegría y otros con indiferencia: no esperes que el que tiene dos hijos en pre-adolescentes esté 100% de acuerdo con la libre oferta de sustancias psicotrópicas, es pocoi probable que lo esté, mientras que el estudiante de bajo estrato no ve nada de malo en un periquito de vez en cuando. Decirle a la gente que ahora puede salir con sus hijos y ver la gente clavandose heroina en un baño de un bar porque ""es legal"" es ... crear mas divisiones en la sociedad y ya tenemos bastantes con la uribe y petro.

Usé estereotipos a propósito porque eso es lo que hay relacionado con la legalización: viste el problema que se armó por la tumbada del artículo del código de policia, por parte de la corte constitucional, acerca de la prohibición de las drogas en público ? un enorme grupo, mayoritario, no está de acuerdo con la legalización y el libre consumo.

Hablando estrictamente de nuestro país, la legalización entonces sería un problema social mayor: vamos a tener un grupo mayoritario, que no va a estar de acuerdo: como lidiar con ese problema ? cada momento que alguien salga a la calle va a encontrar gente en las drogas, ahora legales, te imaginas que puede pasar en esa situación en nuestro país ? si un grupo de paisas aprobó que bajaron la bandera gay (yo no estuve de acuerdo con la subida pero estuve en completo desacuerdo con la bajada, con la acción de desobediencia civil), te imaginas cuando un grupo similar se encuentre un parche de amigos empepados en la calle ? pana en los 90's salían a darle balines y pintura a los homosexuales en la calle, te imaginas que puede pasar ahora cuando hay mayor intolerancia ?

Ahora, sumale otros problemas (y le estoy dando la razón a los detractores): el control de las drogas legales siempre ha sido poco fiable en el país: el alcohol entra de contrabando a cada rato y basta con ir a cualquier sanandresito para conseguir mas barato el whisky que vale mas caro en Exito. Lo mismo pasa con el cigarrillo. Igualmente, chirrinche y biche se consiguen relativamente facil (el chirrinche es ""legal""), los alambiques no son permitidos pero hay. Entonces, te imaginas con la droga ? las farc y los cientos de pequeños narcos, y los miles de quimicos saben como hacer droga entonces la posibilidad de enfrentarse al mercado legal es real y continua tal cual: el mercado responde a las variaciones de precios es decir, si por ejemplo me venden una pepa de 2cb legal por $10.000 y una ilegal por $5.000 .... el mercado se mueve hace el barato. Si, hay unos que preferiran calidad asi como hay unos que pagan whisky sello azul de $500.000 la botella y otros la sello rojo de $50.000, pero el mercado ilegal continua por monton.

En ese caso le estamos es pasando el problema de antinarcóticos a la polfa porque ya entonces hablamos de evasión de impuestos y no de narcotráfico. Y no, conseguir la misma droga, legal, mas barata no es fácil por la característica que la ilegal actual es de calidad ""no profesional"", no es hecha con buenas prácticas de manufactura, etc. Si, la cocaina es de alta pureza pero es hecha en sitios ocultos, escondidos, con químicos que no son idoneos para un mercado exigente. conseguir droga de ""calidad"" es caro aquí y en todos los países entonces, el golpe para las mafias del narcotráfico no va a ser tan grande como se podría pensar.

Otra, los gringos. Podemos hablar todas las pestes que queramos de los gringos, que son hps, que son lindos, que son feos, que son invasores, que son imperialistas, etc. Pero lo real es: son el papá de sur, centro y norteamérica por dos razones: 1) porque tienen el mercado de 350 millones de gringos con plata que son consumidores desesperados, que botan todo nuevo compran  y compran y vuelven a comprar entonces son el mercado mas apreciado por el mundo entero (si, Europa es grande pero los europeos no son tan consumistas y china es enorme pero allá no se puede vender). y 2) tienen el ejercito mas poderoso del mundo ganandole los siguientes 14 paises (creo) que le siguen entonces .... cuando un man te puede quitar la papita, igual como trump está jodiendo a huawei o a venezuela o cuando te pueden parquear un portaaviones con f-35 en frente .... mejor llevarla suave con ellos. Es nuestra condición natural, no nos gusta, no es bonita pero tenemos que saber que irnos en contra el poderoso parido republicano, es decir de unos millonarios gringos con poder, plata y fanaticos religiosos (que combinación pa dar miedo), no es muy inteligente si queremos seguir vendiéndole el 27% de nuestros productos a los Estados Unidos (cifras de Proexport del 2018) y si queremos, esta es peor, seguir teniendo el derecho a comprar ciertos productos - de nuevo mire a huawei. Si, Uruguay lo hizo pero la region metropolitana de medellin es casi tan grande como uruguay entero entonces ... digamos que no cuenta.

Que pena la largura, quería expresar mis razones sopesadas para estar en contra, por practicidad no por convencimiento, contra la legalización en nuestro país. El día que los gringos lo hagan, el día que exista mas tolerancia y el día que se encuentren maneras de hacer drogas de manera económicas, con buenas prácticas de manufactura, que exista mercado mas allá de nuestras fronteras, que se logre eliminar o reducir el componente dañino para el cuerpo humano, tal vez podríamos considerarlo. 

En ese entonces no mas falta convencer los fundamentalistas religiosos.",1

I got Leaf Green back in MCM last May and decided a few weeks ago that I would try out doing a nuzlocke in each region, starting off with Fire Red/Leaf Green on my ancient GBA SP. I beat the game a little over 41 hours over the course of 3-4 weeks and my team was:  


Flora the Venusaur, Level 47  
\- Razor Leaf, Leech Seed, Toxic and Return

Quake the Rhydon, Level 50  
\- Rock Slide, Earthquake, Take Down, Tail Whip

Argo the Slowbro, Level 50

\- Fly, Tri Attack, Drill Peck, Pursuit

\- Strength, Shadow Ball, Brick Break, Yawn

This has got to be one of my favourite teams out of my 13 years of playing Pokemon, even with the lack of a lot of types. Snorlax was the absolute MVP of the team, especially the Elite 4 where he could demolish most members beside Bruno. Baymax and Slowbro struck fear inside all the Elite 4. For it being my first FRLG experience in more than 8 years, I enjoyed it but I did find the grinding and overall speed of the game was very slow + playing on a non-backlit GBA SP wasn't that fun.

All those people are grown up now, and don't want their kids to do the drugs that they did, so there is this sort of 'it's not fun anymore' kind of mentality. Nightclubs are very much a thing of the past in New York due to rents and insurance, but in the heyday of Peter Gatien night clubs it was the place to be (although people overdosed and died). 

Coke became played out and people switched to prescription pills like xanax and percocets and then on to crystal/tina/meth. 

It seems that drugs become popular, and then as the generation gets older, dies out as new drugs come on the scene. It's almost like at any one point in time, there is a 'new drug'. Right now, it's vaping and meth, a few years ago it was oxycotin.",1

In Germany, Oxycodon drugs are only available on a special recipe (not the usual one you need for standard drugs, but for drugs that can create addiction; those recipes are much harder to come by than those for normal, non-addictive drugs).",1
313,2019-09-11 07:28:38+00:00,"Have you tried a rehab and MAT? Highly recommend for opiate abuse.

I've done drugs for over two decades. I had/have a lot of demons. Book series worthy life events just dug me deeper and deeper in throughout the years. I knew I would either O.D. or go to prison before I would be able to stop.

I've everything I could get my hands on since the age of 14. I have lied, cheated, stolen...anything and everything to get a fix, all while maintaing (mostly) steady employment.

First big addiction was cocaine. By big addiction, I mean daily use by whateve means necessary. Selling seemed to be the way to go to feed my ever-increasing habit. I knew I could make more money without a job taking up my days, so I quit to sell full time. 

I had someone teach me how to cook crack. Bad idea. I went from wads of money in every pocket to not being able to pay back fronts to people YOU DID NOT want to owe. I got off it then, only because I had burned every bridge that lead to china white. At least for then.

At 16, I found out I liked pain killers, while simultaneously finding out my father figure liked them too. First time I had one, I stole the rest of the bag from him. (Long story about hidden sketchy adoption I didn't find out about until a few years ago. I told y'all I had BOOKS worth of some of shit that sounds to crazy to be true. I guess ""if it never happened I wouldn't be who I am today""-type uplifting shit should be said here.   Hooray.) 

I loved them, just didn't score that often. I found pretty reliable sources later on, thankfully. (sarcasm font)

There was not a day that went by that I didn't have a pocket full of various pharmaceuticals. I was great at self-prescribing. My days involved downing a mixture of opiates, muscle relaxers, and adderall. I even had a special pouch that was my dedicated pill bag. 

The first time I did meth, I didn't like it. Years later after I had already bought everyone's adderalls, I found out I fucking loved it. Really took the piss out of third shift, until I couldn't sleep during the days either. Best way to fix that, of course, was more meth. Adderall was now replaced with meth in my trusty pill pouch.

This whole time, I had been fooling almost everyone, so I had thought.

It finally took being called out on my shit. I had started dating someone that saw was happening. Why? Because our stories were similar, except for he got help. 

I remember that day so well. I had been withdrawing for about a week. I was broke, and even if I had money, everyone seemed to be out. Got a call back with good news finally, after dedicating days to mission of scoring. Fuuuuuck it if they were fake oxy 30s, I heard they might have fentenyl in them, and that was good enough for me!

I sold one of my power tools. Thanks to my tool hoarding, I never depleted my tool stash. (From my ""forema'am"" days. I made that word up after I retired ""forewoman"".) I spent all the money on the pills. I decided for the both of us, we weren't eating that night. He had had enough.

The thing we can laugh about today was the thing that made me cry harder in my blanket cocoon that night. ""I GUESS WE'RE EATING PILLS TONIGHT!"", he said. I cried myself to sleep that night, feeling awfully sorry for myself, I had such a mean boyfriend. He made me feel so ashamed, that I didn't do any of them that night. ""I am withdrawing, doesn't  he care?"" I thought.

Really wouldn't have mattered, though. Their weren't any opiates even in them. What was then on of life's cruel jokes, saved my life. A couple weeks later, my guy O.D.ed on the same batch. 

He got one full of fentenyl. He was only 19. 

I got into an outpatient rehab, with an all women's I.O.P. program. I would have been an inpatient, but no beds were available. Due to the crisis in my state, grants were made for those who wanted help, but could not afford it. I was accepted, because of basically the death rate from opiates being the second biggest killer in my state at the time.

I started classes immediately. 9-12 M-Thurs and started their M.A.T. program for suboxone therapy.

I would like to mention now, for all the people who want to say, ""Oooohhhhh replacing one addiction for another. Tisk Tisk!"", that when you have failed so many times on your own, and nothing has worked, suboxone is it. By all means, if you can do it with the other meds, please do. If suboxone is your last route, my advice is to keep the lowest dose you can stand, and begin titration as soon as you can. I'm down to 2mg, and about to go down again. 

Tough love helps, but wanting to quit helps even more. You have to want it. My opinion on why the success rates can be low, is because I was 1 of 2 people in a 30+ person class that wasn't there because of DSS or criminal charges. I'm not saying those people cannot WANT to be clean, I'm saying a LOT of them seemed to be doing the song and dance for what ever agency required them to be there. This is from my experience though, and only one I.O.P. stent, in one little city in the US. 

If you need tough love and aren't getting it, contact me. I will be there. If you don't know where to start, contact me. I will try to help. If you need to vent to a stranger, contact me. I want to hear you.

I have spent a lot of time typing this out on my phone. I have never shared this story before. I know this has jack shit to do with the topic, and I'm sorry, but I'm tired of addicts being shitted on. We need help, not hate. If this helps one person, the lack of sleep is worth it to me.

326,2019-09-10 17:19:15+00:00,"Darren Waller knew a bad game wasn’t possible. Not this game. Not this night. Not after what he received.
He was headed off the field and down the tunnel before Monday night’s game against Denver at the Coliseum. A fan got his attention and handed him something. It was a sobriety chip, a Raiders version, celebrating the two years clean and sober threshold he recently crossed. Waller had shared his story of overcoming addiction on the show “Hard Knocks.” Now he got to feel the impact of his transparency.
“That had me lit before the game,” Waller said, showing off his silver and black chip with a “II” on it. “Sent chills through me.”
Something big happened on Monday night, perhaps lost in the hype of the Raiders’ energetic 24-16 handling of the Broncos. Something bigger than football. Something profoundly inspirational.
Waller, who turns 27 on Friday, made his first start with the Raiders, and first in the NFL since November 2016. But that’s not why the night was big for him.
He finished with seven receptions on eight targets, both team highs, and totaled 70 yards receiving — all career highs. But that’s not why the game was so special.
Monday night was his debut. Not in the NFL, or with the Raiders, but as a new person in a big new role. It was the beginning of the next chapter of Waller’s story. In this one, he’s the starting tight end. In this one, he is reliable and trustworthy, maximizing his potential. In this one, he is giving hope instead of losing it.
He’s gone from dependent upon alcohol and prescription drugs to being dependable on third downs. He went from stocking groceries at Sprouts in Atlanta to blocking lineman and running routes in Oakland. He went from not liking himself and getting so high as to feel invisible to loving himself and getting so hyped as to feel invincible.
Wins in football are great, but triumphs in life are even greater. Waller declared victory on Monday.
“I loved it. I think we all here, everybody, roots for Darren Waller,” Derek Carr said. Having devoted his life to ministry, Carr livened up even more when he started talking about his new tight end. The magnitude was not lost on the quarterback.
“You know how many people that helps for him to be that vulnerable?” Carr said. “I said that’s unbelievable. That blesses my life to see someone that vulnerable and that open. It wasn’t hard for him. He was just talking (on ‘Hard Knocks’), telling people his story. Imagine if everyone could open up like that, how many more people could get help, how many more people we can help.
“To see him now transition to being a professional football player — not trying to get cut — he’s in professional football making plays on ‘Monday Night Football,’ starting tight end for the Oakland Raiders. I think that’s a powerful thing.”
It was Waller’s 23rd game since Baltimore drafted him out of Georgia Tech in the sixth round in 2016. But the previous 22 games were played with anxiety.
Monday was different. He noticed it. He felt it.
Anxiety tends to be about anticipating the future, being worried and concerned about what’s going to happen, what people are going to think, how things might go wrong. But Waller got to the spot he’s in by soaking in the now, by appreciating the present, investing in every moment and every decision.
That’s how “one day at a time works.” Waller said he knows it has become cliche. But he is evidence of its effectiveness. Being present and accountable every day, cherishing every moment and cognizant of how he’s feeling, has resulted in a responsible and productive man.
It hasn’t been two years clean and sober, but 730-plus days. Of giving his all. Of trying to do the right thing. Of considering others.
That’s a lot of victories, so it makes sense why his confidence is at an all-time high.
“I had like a calm that I never really had before playing football,” Waller said. “It was peace. I know I belong here. I know I can make something happen.”
It has also helped the amount of faith the Raiders have put in him. They said goodbye to Pro Bowl tight end Jared Cook because they believed in Waller. They handed him the starting job without even putting him through the pressure of being cut.
Second chances usually aren’t taken lightly for recovering addicts. Especially not Waller.
He remembers thinking he was going to die after swallowing pills he believed were laced with fetanyl in August 2017. He remembers being on Baltimore’s practice squad, hoping for an opportunity, before the Raiders added him to their roster.
To be given this chance?
“That’s all I need,” he said.
Waller’s speed was evident Monday. The former wide receiver lined up on the outside and blew past Broncos cornerback Isaac Yiadom for a 25-yard reception down the sidelines, putting the Raiders in the red zone on the opening drive.
But Waller also proved to be one of Carr’s favorite reads over the middle. The 6-foot-6, 255-pound tight end is a sizable target whose explosiveness keeps the defense off balance enough for him to curl and sit in the middle of the field.
Waller said Carr told Waller to win every route because he was coming to him. With no Antonio Brown, the complementary receivers become even more valuable. Waller took the advice from Carr seriously and their rapport got off to a strong start.
“We saw it all camp, the plays he’s able to make and the guy he is,” wide receiver Tyrell Williams said. “It’s awesome to see guys like that have success. That’s big. A lot of guys get the chance and they kind of mess it up. I can’t imagine how he feels and how his family feels.”
Adversity is sure to meet Waller on the field. The Broncos didn’t prove much of a problem for the Raiders offense, despite being led by defensive guru Vic Fangio. But the day is coming when it will be tougher, when the struggle comes in earnest.
But that’s what made Monday such a heartwarming night. Because Waller will be ready like he’s never been. He will be present and accountable. He will be in the moment, feel it, appreciating whatever comes his way because he is truly alive.
“This just tells you what is possible,” Waller said. “It’s a life worth living.”

Was trying to get the same kind of thing, just to have a fucking rest for 5 minutes and stop living on a knife edge. ""Er, sorry we only deal with people who've had trauma like a car accident in the last 2 years"" I kid you fucking not.

Made me epihpanize why tobacco isn’t scheduled? Lsd or shrooms wouldn’t have me like that. I hate being so full of anger and tension. American spirits gotta be the best. Natives and indigenous ppl never experienced the harmful effects we do from tobacco bc simply organic naturally organic shit isn’t full of unregulated pesticides and fertilizers to assist mass production that makes a radioactive product. I’m sure American spirits are bad too but compared to other commercial brands I’ll bet good money you’ll have a lower chance of health effects from them due to the lack of adulterants. I worked for a weed grower who rolled his own American spirits and he’s my idol, the chillest most level headed dude I’ve ever had the pleasure to become family with. I wondered “why does he always roll his own?” It makes sense to me now tho. Yeah the tobacco is organic (the only stoges I’d smoke) but when you’re heating up and practically vaporizing the filter and paper that’s all somehow unregulated that shit is obviously terrible to inhale especially compared to a raw 300 organic hemp paper lol. This whole spiel made me realize I wanna quit. The social damage nicotine does is comparable to many other scheduled drugs and I knew tobacco companies are evil but the consequences are so understated. My country (USA) mislead a whole generation you can smoke in fuckin hospitals bc their healthy. Then oxycodine came along promising your life back making you feel young again And the best part is it’s non habit not addiction causing! (According to 90s DEA/big pharma) and after a decade or so of vaping tbey say it’s causing fatal lung diseases killing people with the only correlation is that “thc was found in samples too” disregarding the fact that thc is safe to vaporize and ignoring how people vape shit like b12 for energy and who knows what other vitamins and unregulated additives that are the actual correlation between these fatalities. I can’t find shit on correlation. After over a decade of people vaping nic+pg/vg with no health problems all of a sudden 1/4 ton + people are experiencing life dying/fatal effects and the only info they provide is thc was found in samples?? Are they serious? Speculating it’s unregulated additives, regular h202 bleached cotton in pods or god knows  what I wish I knew. But they use these 1/4 ton of peoples injuries/fatalities to push their anti cannabis agenda instead of telling us “well a good portion of them uses x vape or x juice or vaped x vitamin.” But nope. No correlation. Just 1/4 ton of people are more magically experiencing life ruining effects from vapes.. but hey we found THC in some of the samples! Like I *need* to know correlation. It’s misleading, uneducating and spreading propaganda and doesn’t help anyone. But I’m not surprised they’re the ones who show the face. Name, kills, weapons etc of mass shooters after a killing like the stats after a COD match, but when it comes to any psychoactive substance besides alcohol,pharmaceuticals or tobacco (socially acceptable ones) their up arms using their data to attack yeah the crack, cocaine, heroin should be detrimented and shunned but when you add a statistic of THC It the purest from showned to be the safest (considering combusting ‘flame to fiber’ with anything = carcinogenic) it’s so fucking misleading and misleading will only raise the fatalities of the unregulated and toxic shit correlated with 1/4 ton fatal Injuires. I do my research with EVERYTHING but I’m clueless how how 500+ People are experiencing fatal injuries from something people have been using for over a decade and I damn sure well know thc has *nothing* to do with it. Hell is it my new novo? Do they use peroxide bleached cotton? Smoking flavorings from my reds ejuice? Or simply being too lazy to change pods for weeks bc ‘yeah it’s black and tastes like shit but works” who knows if I’ll ever know. Fuck suorin. Fuck the misleading media, fuck the DEA and all the holes Their shoving thier dick into. The media is for info and propaganda and they could give an f less about how all of a sudden these people are dying from vaping. Oh they found thc? *perfecf* that’s all we gotta mention and they’ll link vaping thc deaths and vaping deaths into their paradigm",1

I come from southern Canada in an area saturated with dairy farms where sentimentality isn't part of the process and people are serious about breeding good herds, generally of Holsteins, and aren't happy about the neighbour's bull literally fucking them out of the several thousand dollars that they could sell a well-bred heifer calf (or later as a bred cow) with the proper pedigree for if that beef bull hadn't bred the cow in the first place and ruined the farmer's work in planning herd genetics, ordering specific semen and planning out a mensuration cycle. The killing of rampaging bulls has been standard practice here for a century or more, though thankfully it's rarely necessary now since AS has come into widespread practice.

Not to mention that a bull in the process of breeding a cow in heat could kill anyone trying to stop it from happening, potentially putting the lives of a farmer or his/her hired man/woman in the pasture at risk when the bull jumped the fence.

What kind of operation is 'non-violent' and doesn't involve shooting anything? Why would killing a neighbours bull that's fucking up your whole operation be offensive to the farmer who's cows are being bred against their wishes? What do the Pueblo have to do with it? This sounds like some hippie hobby operation rather than a farm with someone who knows their business, no offence.

Also for the record I would say that your farmer buddy should be able to administer Ocycontin to induce abortion or get a vet to do so - feeding the thing special haylage wouldn't do anything - but it's generally not worth the stress to the animal to induce abortion.",1

However street heroin is not so well behaved, and the pH of the product can vary quite a bit. Adding a bit of an acid like ascorbic acid or citric acid (or Lemon juice) helps brings it all into solution.
And then there's the various other opiates that also dissolve better in slightly acidic conditions.


So most people will add a pinch of ascorbic acid or citric acid to adjust the pH when cooking up the heroin.

In addition even pure diamorphin hydrochloride dissolves much faster in acidic pH. You don't normally want to inject acidic or basic substances if it can be avoided.",1

Id take one tablet twice a day per instructions,  and i could tell my pain level was almost non existent about 30mins after taking my pk, but about 4 hrs later the pain would come back,  but gradually it seemed more excruciating every single time the oxy wore off.  Then someone intro'd me to snorting oxy, so id snort 15mgs, and soon started swallowing 2 or 3 to get through work. Everyone knows this slope... Id run out of my pain meds sometime's 20 days early,  my buddy that showed me snorting oxy was a quick easy,  yet amazing feeling,  got the og opana 40mgs. Moisten outer coating,  wipe it off,  smash,  snort.  I was dope sick and he came over and put 1 opana 40mg, and 6x8mg dilaudid on my table i wasn't too pharmecuetically saavy back then,  he told me what each were (oxymorphone, and hydromorphone) then explained how bioavailability works,  he also mentioned he had people calling day and night offering $12-$20 for the dillys, and $25\$50 for the opana. I thought that's insane how much do u pay for the rxs, he told me insurance covered every penny.  He got 30x3mg xanax xrs, 60x40mg opana, and 90 dillys a month.  I was def intrigued..  I took half the opana (20mgs), and 2x8mg dills, made a massive line,  and once it was in my nose,  the taste,  the good slight burn, breaking the tabs into the finest powder possible. I loved everything about it,  the colors,  shapes of the pills, the perperation of breaking em down,  then i started feeling the new opiate cocktail of which I've never taken either drug alone,  i was so happy,  sociable, optimistic nothing could bring me down..  Later i learned dilaudid were a waste to snort,  or swallow...  I did a few Google Searches and had unlimited access to needles cause my roommate had diabetes, i took 1&amp;1\2 hydromorphones crushed into powder placed in spoon, filled a 1ml syringe about 75%, put it on the dilly powder, mixed the solution for probly 15minutes, placed a clean cotton piece of cig filter in the solution pulled every drop of liquid through,  and noticed there was still a lot of powder,  fillers/binders etc.. So i figured i messed up some minute detail and didn't understand all the highly water soluble hydromorph was dissolved in the water,  and the powder was garbage.  But have it a try anyways.... Took like 7 or 8 tries b4 i registered blood,  but when i did i plunged down,  and fuck, i found my one true love...   Next i started shooting cocaine and dilaudid in the same shot, that iv rush is indescribable,  until some 1 gave me a ampuole of midazolam for iv use. I had 3 balloons of tar, 3x8mg h/morphone, so i made a shot 33units tar, 30 units midazolam,  and 1 dilaudid in one shot,  hot vein and registered 1st try, push the plunger way slower this time,  i made it to 14-15 units remaining thinking something doesn't feel right.. I woke up in the hospital from respiratory failure,  and was alone when i did the shot,  luckily my neighbor saw me drop &amp; called emts, otw id been long gone by now.  And even though they paramedics told me i was basically dead for multiple minutes,  i didnt care,  that feeling just b4 i fell out,  was as close to heaven i could ever imagine!  When I got to the hospital,  i told the dr i had walked 14 miles the day and night b4, admitted i snorted about 75-100mgs of heroin around 8am, and it was around 5pm at this point.  He asked if i got sick when i didn't use... I replied YES probably b4 he could get out his last syllable of the question,  i had an infection on my foot from a glass cut the top of my foot,  and i lived outside,  and only had 1 pr of shoes.  He saw it and told me i needed iv a\biotics asap b4 my blood also became infected which u can easily die from.  He told me the iv abiotics was a 24 infusion,  i told him fuck off, he interrupted and said first let's get u feeling better.. 
  He walked out of the room and reappeared just as fast.. With some thing clenched in his hand. He said left or right hand,  w his hands behind his back, i guessed left,  he had hydromorph ampules , and a cup with two watson lortab 10s in it.  He had me swallow the pills,  and then hooked the dilly into my pick line. Didn't take long and it was like the 1st time i ever felt that opi warmth rush, then as he was walking out of my room i said what was in ur right hand,  he said... Wouldn't u like to know...  And i noticed he had a mini paper cup same as contained the lortab, he opened a drawer and threw the other amp's in there  closed it and walked out.   I waited until the coast was clear,  and went opened the drawer, there was 2 OC 40s, 4 liq iv ampules, one morphine, 2 dilaudid, and 1 called pethidine (demerol) which i want familiar with at the time. So that night,  i pulled the iv line out, catheter , could only find my jeans and shirt,  no socks, shoes,  underwear,  or jacket.  Got dressed,  grabbed every drug in that drawer, later noticed there were 6 sample blisters each containing 1 scwartz(sp?) Pharmaceutical 2 mg niravam odt. I made it from the 4th floor where my room was,  to the ground floor,  found the 1st bathroom, i smashed down 2 oc 40s, and 2x2mg Niravam (alprazolam) broke into 2 lines,  one up each nostril,  and luckily i had one new needle stashed for emergencies. It was about 4 miles from the hospital I'm sneaking out of,  but 80mg oxy + 4 mg xanax were already making things possible.  
    I walked to where my emergency supply was hidden (contained 24x25mg librium, 2x10 blister packs containing 50mg tramadol, and like. 25 of mephedrone, and 1 individually sealed sterile BD 1\2ml syringe.

I remember laying at the bottom of the half pipe and realizing straight away that something was very wrong. My friend walked over and was laughing at me until he saw that my leg was very broken. 

I layed there for about 40 minutes until an ambulance came, they put me on a stretcher, and also gave me morphene which really helped because at that stage I was in an insane amount of pain. It turns out I had a spiral fracture and my femur was completely snapped in two. 

When I got to the hospital they set the bone which was just about the most horrific pain of my life, and then performed surgery on me by drilling two holes into my knee and putting titanium rods into my femur. I had a removable cast which was pretty amazing because if I was itchy I could just remove it. 

6 months in a wheelchair and then 2 more surgeries later I was finally able to walk again. I still have a limp, and I'm hyper conscious of putting any weight on my leg but shit I will be so careful skateboarding for the rest of my life, and I'm never touching a half pipe again.",1

Everything went well, no issues and she was perfect. 

I recovered well. I healed quickly and wasn't in much pain. I was in hospital for 5 days because I reacted to the drugs they gave me but that had nothing to do with the C-section, more with my body not liking morphine. 

I was eventually put on oxycodine and was good to go home. I was given parametomal, ibeprofine and 4 oxy. I took some parametomal and ibeprofine but never the oxy. The pain wasn't bad and from memory I stopped taking any painmeds 8 or 9 days after birth.

Cannabinoids and Flavinoids found in the flower are molocules that, when taken via their respective ROA's (nobody is injecting THC, trust me on this) they cause an effect that can typically last a window of several hours; and, as I would attest, wouldn't be any more or less harmful than having a beer without nearly as much negative health impacts as is caused by, say, fetal alcohol syndrome? 

Food and ""Legal Drugs"" also contain molocules that can be extremely unhealthy: take fast food, which has many saturated and trans fats that can increase one's risk of premature death from obesity, certain cancers and cardiovascular disease. The same is true of tobacco use as well via nicotine.

Have you ever heard of a woman losing her child during pregnancy due to cannabis use? The answer is no, unless you're law enforcement separating a mother from her child because of ""Durr Lauww!""

Pregnant mothers at risk.

The vaccine also doesn't last forever. I think 20 years? That's how the adults are now getting it. And insurance isn't covering the booster shots for older ppl. Maybe the elderly in nursing homes but I dunno. 

You didn't *need* the boosters cause it wasn't an issue where you could catch it from a kid. It wasn't something we needed to worry about.

We really have to learn to learn people. Learn about the things u put in your body, understand your body, its metabolism, how any drug works and study some basic pharmacology. Especially with ADHD meds. We ourselves need to be the people who will teach nitwits in the street or in the office why our use of these meds is morally defendable and to get there we need to be able to explain why it works, how it works and therefore need to be able to explain the neurology of ADHD.

383,2019-09-06 01:35:52+00:00,"Not sure if you're even going to listen since you seem so irked about the Scaling Argument, but I figured I should share the basics with you and anyone else who might be reading.

In a larger area, you have to worry about transport and distribution. Things have to be properly packaged and stored during transport. Everything has to be properly labeled for distribution on a large scale (like sending 500 boxes of Oxycotin and Marijuana to three different cities of varying distance) and on a smaller scale (taking one of the boxes' contents and making sure they are labeled and stored properly). All of this packaging and labeling takes resources of their own to make, and people have to put the packages and labels on. If the packaging is damaged or insufficient, the products inside could very well be deemed unusable, and can strain the amount of resources a facility has. Maybe the products are still ok but they went to the wrong facility in the wrong city. We've got to get those packaged back up and sent to the other city. If a truck or train that is shipping the products in bulk ends up in a crash or derailment then that's millions of dollars instantly down the drain.

All of this can be handled in a city, or a small state country where the population density isn't too high. But as the distance increases the time it takes to ship stuff will increase. Across the city might be an hour or two at the worst. Across the country of Portugal might end up being a dusk-to-dawn drive. From a distance of California to a midwestern state like South Dakota or Missouri could easily take two and a half days. Also, a higher population density will likely mean that you'll have more people demanding the service, meaning that it will be harder for a dispensery to build up a reserve to deal with a potential delay or destruction of products being shipped to them.

Logistics and Scaling are NOTHING to sneeze at. Just for example, look at some of the hiccups and headaches that Canada is dealing with after having legalized Marijuana. Here's an example, a few months old but still showcasing the headaches of distribution in a large nation, and that's one without a dense population: https://globalnews.ca/news/5186922/six-months-after-legalization-high-prices-and-supply-issues-boost-illicit-pot-market/ .",1

I have heard others tell me that this is the actual real quality stuff and I have to disagree. I have noticed while backing up the dose does make me feel less shitty, it also doesn't give me that positive and pain feeling effect I've come to expect from kratom. If I were to broker a theory, I would say the alkaloids aren't the same balance I'm used to receiving. I've only ever received that effect from cheaper, lower quality (and lower cost) kratom. In fact, the vape store I get this from has had similar complaints from others that are used to taking kratom and know what to expect.

In my experience, a good quality kratom will be potent, but it will be more difficult to get the wobbles and feel bad even at higher doses. A good, quality kratom will have pain relieving properties, a mild euphoria, some mild stimulating properties and help some with anxiety. Lousy quality kratom gives you the wobbles very easily. It can make you feel somewhat ill, achy, nauseous, etc. It's a lot like withdrawal, but not as bad -if you dose it just right, which is usually about half my regular amount. Even though you're not feeling the negative effects as much at the lower dose, neither do you feel the positive effects.

In a way this is all a bit frightening. Sometimes I do worry a bit. After all, in most places kratom is unregulated and you have to trust your vendor. I worry about some fool trying to cut an actual opiate like fetanyl or something into it. That could be disastrous.",1

   * block certain enzymes in the body that help make chemicals that signal pain. When these enzymes are blocked, you feel less pain.
   * Examples are Ibuprofen and aspirin
* Opioids work the other way around
   * They block the receptors so less of the 'pain chemical' reaches your brain, much like earplugs

440,2019-09-01 22:16:50+00:00,"I've been through more than most people, when I saw a psychologist it took 3 hours to outline it all.

 I had narcissistic parents who made my childhood hell, I actually didn't have a childhood as I  was never wanted so I was either verbally abused or just ignored.  At 17 I had a serious car accident leaving me half blind and a TBI.  2 years later I had a child who I gave up for adoption as the father all but killed me.  During labour I needed a caeserian but as it was an adoptive case they made me go through the birth naturally and I pushed my vaginal wall out and needed reconstructive surgery to try and mend it.  My parents refused to help me as they didn't care.  I tried to kill myself and my parents told me I'd inconvenienced them by having to go to the hospital and even having to sit with one another as they'd been divorced 20 years was bad enough.  Met a good man, desperate for a child but nothing.  Fell in love with my now husband, got divorced, eloped and married my husband and life was good. I had and paid for a Gastric by pass and on coming home within a week my step mother's niece got murdered by her partner so my dad and step mum and dad took custody of her children (wouldn't help me when pregnant).  My step father forged my mother's signature on mortgage documents and remortgaged the house as he was told he was dying and spent the lot on gambling and prostitutes.  I got sepsis and was very ill and my sister started taking coke and despite having sepsis, I had to help them all out. 

Moved 100 miles away for a fresh start and to get away from my parents and I got pregnant, ectopic and nearly died again as I lost so much blood.  Turns out the twins my father and step mother adopted, one had a genetic disorder and will never speak, doesn't understand or comprehend and my father was amazing with him.  Sister OD'd quite a few times on coke but always got through it. Parents barely bothered with me as too busy with their own lives which was good for me. 

I got pregnant and it all went well, had a caeserian and we both died and had to be resuscitated as he was laying on the vena cava.  Made it through and was so happy, my parents didn't even bother to visit, expected us to drive to them.  

We Flooded in 2007 and lost the complete downstairs of our house, moved into a flat whilst the house was being rebuilt, hubby worked away and I had a tyrant of a boss.  I remember my son getting chicken pox and she screamed at me as I had to take urgent holiday to look after him as he couldn't go to nursery. Finally moved back in, had a hysterectomy and you guessed it, I had an internal bleed and didn't die but had to have urgent blood transfusions but it was wonderful as I honestly thought passing out when you had periods was normal as well as going through super plus tampons every 20 minutes was normal as my doctor kept telling me every woman is different and some have it worse than others!

Saw my parents sporadically, my mum worked in a department store in the children's wear department and never bought my son a thing.  My dad and step mum were too busy with the twins so my son had no one but us as my husband is a fair bit older than me and his mum was in her 70s when he was born, she loved him so much but we always had to visit her due to age and that was fine, I'd also cook as she was so frail.  I was happy as I loved low contact with my family and then Christmas 7 or so years ago my dad and I fell out after he told the whole table what a disappointment I've always been and his new children are being brought up properly, unlike me as I was dragged up as my mother was a bit h yada yada yada.  I've always been so scared of him but I lost it and I vented 43 years of pent up feelings and told him i never wanted to see him again, my husband said he had never see me lose my temper like that as I was so scary as my voice goes low and I never shout.  So finally, NC with Dad - yay.

Unfortunately my mum is still enabling my sister, she even took my step dad back after he got the £30k out of the house and between him and my sister, stole all her jewellery and anything of value to fund their habits.  She never bothered with us at all unless she needed help.  When my step dad passed I had to deal with it all despite having a then 33 year old sister and 30 year old brother as she just molly coddled them. 

I then get cancer, the tumour was the size of a honey dew melon and it had encapsulated my kidney.  If it had spread it would be deemed incurable but thankfully it hasn't spread so I had it removed.  Due to having the gastric by pass removing the tumour and all the fat and tissue etc left me in pain 24/7 and the doctor put me on oxyxodone as he didn't read my notes and oxy is absorbed in the small intestine, which I don't have so I was accused of being an addict because I was telling them it didn't work. Mum upset as my sister won't come off coke but she did come up for 3 days to help look after my son whilst I was in hospital.  I got sepsis again so was in a lot longer than planned but I survived so life is good and I'm very lucky.   I had to leave the job I loved and take ill health retirement as I can't sit down for 2 hours without being in agony.  Also the tiredness was too much so it was a relief but it was lonely. 

5 years on and I have a lot of health problems as you can imagine, they've found shadows in my R lung but are waiting to see if they spread, but despite morphine patches, I was always in pain.  Put on fentanyl and OMG I can do things, finally not much pain, it is bearable but you know the war on opiates, they want to take me off them so am currently fighting my doctor.  In the meantime my blood pressure is roughly 50/20 or 60/30 (taken in hospital) so always tired and often feel dizzy .  Endocrine system is in bits, only go to the toilet once a month and feel a-sexual with no desire and cannot have the big O so health wise I'm a disaster.  

It was my 50th in May and we decided on a small get together and my mum booked and paid for her and my drug addict sister to go to Turkey for 2 weeks two days before my birthday, told my husband she considers me a friend not a daughter so I told her I was done, she sent some really nasty messages which I ignored.

There is so much more but I'm still surviving because I have a 14 year old who depends on me and he is my world.  My husband is amazing but its been a hard struggle to get to the point where I genuinely don't give two hoots about my family of origin. 

If I can get through that there is hope for us all and I'm still smiling, might be through gritted teeth at times but still smiling 😊",1

We were stationed on Jurong Island. Only time in the Army there was no outfield for almost a month, air-con bunks, only 3 hours of work a day, chilling in the nice, windy guard tower watching the beautiful seascape, lit up so much that it looked like a city on water. And of course the ice-box with cold drinks, hot water and Maggi, ample snacks, PC and PS delivering food to you wah fuck lah you're really triggering my nostalgia for one of the few truly good times I had in the Army

Not so sure about the Guards thing though, in the SAF all infantry units are trained in amphibious warfare (fucking tell me about it, I once had to jump into a literal river of shit that was waist deep wah lan eh), like the one I was in, 3SIR, which was light infantry (and yeah bro I also wish I was motorised infantry or amoured infantry). I would say 1GDS and 3GDS are more like the Singaporean version of the 75th Ranger Regiment, being elite, heliborne light infantry that while not special forces are a cut above ""normal"" infantry
