Much more dangerous than heroin what they're selling down there these days. I used to do heroin a lot years ago and I don't even like to touch the shit these days because it's all bs like that now. The variation in strength is much more than it used to be so it's much much easier to overdose. At the very least if he refuses to go to rehab and get clean you should get some narcan to keep in the house Incase he overdoses you can administer it while you wait for the ambulance to try to bring him out of OD.

So an inexperienced doctor in scleroderma could of given that diagnosis if they are asymptomatic. So I wouldn't hold onto that if they diagnosed based on antibodies. Now Scleroderma does have a genetic component if you are native there is a connection there. There is also known things to increase your changes like silica. It may be worth seeing a scleroderma specialist to be safe. You can find them on [scleroderma.org](https://scleroderma.org) or you can find a scleroderma center. Now as for the Raynaud there are two types primary and secondary. Secondary Raynaud's is what I believe you get with scleroderma and is caused by it for the systemic forms. Morphea patients can have Raynaud's but for them its primary and not related. Autoimmune diseases run in families but sclerderma in most doctors opinions does not have a genetic connection some say it increases your chance by 1% but theres no proof. Considering you have some of the clinical symptoms id see a specialist and get their opinion,3

I don't know what you're into, but I guarantee no matter what hobby you have you know of stupid laws and restrictions that just don't make sense. Like marijuana being scheduled as more dangerous than opium or fetanyl. Or like gun laws banning AR-15's for being ""high powered assault rifles"" even though it isn't powerful enough to even legally hunt deer in my state.

Now think about that with this virus. Think about everything they tell you that's not adding up.

""We all masked and social distanced enough to all bug get rid of the flu, but we are still seeing millions of cases of covid because we aren't masking and social distancing.""

Despite every suicide prevention hotline saying they have been much more busy with calls about covid and lockdowns, and pandemics historically causing suicide, suicides haven't gone up. Strange. Good, but definitely weird. 

How come all these drug abuse centers are saying that covid has lead to a spike in overdoses, but we aren't seeing more overdose deaths, just covid deaths?

Why are we using any death within 30 days of a covid test, when if you used the same method for something completely harmless, you could make something harmless seem dangerous. Imagine if they kept weed illegal because of all the deaths 30 days after weed use must mean weed is killing people. 

And if we are counting every death within 30 days of a positive covid test as a covid death we should count every death within 30 days of a vaccine as a vaccine death so even if the data isn't perfect, it's an apples to apples comparison and people can decide if it's better to be vaccinated or risk the virus, but yet the government won't let us have accurate data, or even comparable data. Why? 

I'm not okay with choices being made for me, especially not when it comes to injecting chemicals into my body, especially not when it's from a government that has proven itself to be incompetent at best, malicious at worst.",1

is oxy really more bad than codein withdrawal? Normally codeine must be worse because the syrup and sugar is super unhealthy and even tho oxy is a little pro drug because one part must be metabolized to Nor-Oxycodon codein must be metabolized 100% so its much worse than oxy for the organs. Oxy is nearly harmless  for the body and yeah that doesn't mean the turkey isnt bad but codeine fucks up your organs aswell and that hurts even more and the syrup is a problem too I always heard codeine is a little bit badder than Oxy

42,2021-05-30 12:41:42+00:00,"HBO's documentaries aren't by definition bad. Political or social documentaries, probably. When you're making a documentary and you can say HBO picked it up, a lot more people are going to agree to be interviewed. The credibility, funding, and wide audience base HBO brings with it lends towards more people agreeing to be interviewed which helps the overall quality of the documentary by having the full picture from those who were a part of it, not just one side. Of course current employees of Perdue were not interviewed because their lawyers obviously wouldn't let them.

You shouldn't dismiss it solely  because HBO purchased distribution rights to a documentary about the unethical practices of Big Pharma and how corrupt government institutions are and how little the feds care and do to hold Big Pharma accountable. There's a bit where they talk about this bill that was written for the Big Pharma by an ex DEA agent who specialized in Pharamaceuticals on the black market. In short, the bill was worded in a way and titled as to actually be ""pro"" regulations and safety to help prevent pharmaceuticals  being sold on the steers. In reality, it did the opposite because a soulless ex-federal cop helped write it in a way that would change how something was legally defined and in effect prevent the DEA from stopping the distribution of a drug for the purpose of an investigation into the pill mills. It essentially was represented as helping the effort to stop legal drugs being sold illegally but in reality was pro-Pharma. Basically, no one reads these bills which (we already knew) and the government is woefully incapable of not being incompetent and  corrupt. 

You would agree these are all true points. Why would you immediately dismiss a documentary because of who threw money at it when it clearly demonstrates the issues and hypocrisy were all well aware of and during a time when Pharamaceutical companies are backed by the government in suggesting every group of people get a vaccine that makes the companies billions of dollars?  To further elaborate, it goes on in talking about how the owner of a fentanol drug pushed (like a tyrannical leader) a multitude of unethical and illegal practices to get his drug marketed and approved for a wider range of patients and not just cancer/terminal patients because it wasn't making any money. A vaccine that is recommended for every person on earth is the most profitable drug a company can have. If you don't see the parallel of profits taking precedence over safety being drawn in current times then I can't change your mind.

However you probably won't have a really hard time with WDs because of how slow you weened yourself. 15mg MsContin is the lowest dose they make, it's a perfectly fine dose to jump off of with very minimal withdrawal. However if you've been on opiates for 20+ years what'll probably hit you the worst is the mental aspect. Idk if you've heard of ""pink cloud syndrome"" but it's basically a time during detoxing that people have no cravings and life feels super great because it's new and fresh.

Über das fliehen aus der Realität habe ich vorallem zu Beginn viel reflektiert und oft dokus über Drogen geschaut und gedacht yo aus der Realität fliehen und sorgen / Probleme unterdrücken mach ich ja nicht

Im nächsten Moment hab ich aber auch gedacht dass mein größtes Problem ist nicht genug oxycodon zu haben. Weil genug gibts in dem Sinne sowieso nicht. 

Früher dachte ich dass das nie ein Beweggrund war.

Aber ich will sagen dass ich mir da heute nicht mehr so sicher bin. Eine Altersbeschränkung finde ich heute umso sinnvoller.

Um ehrlich zu sein hab ich noch nie wirklich opioide entzogen auf 0

Das Ding mit Heroin ist aber dass die Leute ein falsches Bild davon haben. 

Ein großer Aspekt ist die konsumform (ROA).

53,2021-05-29 20:42:27+00:00,"#*Pressed pill inquiries are not permitted under any circumstances.*

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

56,2021-05-29 15:54:27+00:00,They say that fent analogs (which is different from pharmaceutical fentalyl) stores in your fat cells for up to 72 hours or longer. Which is typically why doctors recommended at least a few days of withdrawl before inducting subs. Especially if you’re using heroin they assume that it’s mixed with fent. I got lucky. I ended up taking the 8mg strip at 12 hours and was completely fine. I don’t recommend that to anyone else tho use the COWS scale and if your over a 10-12 then you should be good.,1

Ich kann nicht behaupten trotz 12 Jahre körperlicher Abhängigkeit je einen ernsthaften Versuch unternommen zu haben aufzuhören.

Es war eher so, dass ich eine zu gute connection hatte durch die ich quasi unendlich oxycodon und flunitrazepam bekommen habe.
Danach war ich auf ~240-280mg oxycodon/Tag und zusätzlich 6-8mg flunitrazepam (hab mal geschaut - die Dinger gibt es praktisch nicht mehr und wenn kostet eine Pille irgendwie 200€)

Als die connection geplatzt ist hatte ich Schwierigkeiten. Große. Zuletzt habe ich von der gleichen noch pharmazeutisches fentanyl bekommen. 
Als klar war dass ich von dort nichts mehr kriegen werde - habe ich mich umgeschaut un dieses fentnaly Labor entdeckt. Das war fatal aber in dem Moment das einzige was ich mit der Toleranz finanziell stemmen konnte.
Needless to say meine Toleranz war danach auf einem Level dass ich mir im 20 Minuten tackt chemische Waffen in die Nase gezogen habe.

78,2021-05-28 02:26:21+00:00,"You are getting into a discussion of why bees swarm.  It’s not completely known why, but if is related to the crowding of the hive and space available.  This will trigger the hive to start making “royal” eggs.  Once the royal eggs begin hatching, the old queen will take off with half the population to start a new hive.  The rest of the hive will stay with the new “queens” while they kill reach other off and destroy any other royal eggs that might remain.  If the old queen remains (too old to fly far) then they will fight her to.

Once that is done the remaining hive population is imprinted on a new queen.  She will then fly off with her entourage for a mating flight, preferring non hive drones but sometimes it’s any port in a storm.  The one flight is enough to provide her with eggs for likely her egg laying career.

Bee keepers typically rotate new queens to their hive to prevent swarming and ensure genetic diversity.  Young queens are better layers and less likely to swarm.   Bees aren’t picky about who the queen is, they just need the sweet queen heroi… pheromone in their life.",5

I was bullied and lied to by medical staff who didn't want me to labour at home. I was lied to about serious conditions that weren't even noted in my chart as possibilities and had no basis in fact. I had morphene, an epidural and yet it was excruciating. I had 2nd degree tares PPD PPA PPR and PTSD from the experience.

My second labour was intended to be a home birth so we were prepared. I had had braxton hicks and hyper emesis  for weeks leading up to labour so I didnt realise I was in real labour until I was in active, very real labour. I delivered my son myself at home and it was entirely redemptive. (Delivering unassisted was not the plan, midwives just couldn't get there in time but arrived 3 minutes after he was born)

My son had the cord around his neck, and a knot in the cord. There were no other issues and tbh I don't know that these are issues but I mention them to be clear about the experience.

The experience I had with my first was totally debilitating, it rocked my confidence for years, terminally changed my personality. My second labour was redemptive. My bedroom filled with a midwife and doula team moments after my son arrived and we were cared for with a tenderness and care I have never experienced. I was petted and congratulated not scolded and shoved around like a thing in the way. 

Labouring at home was easy, painless, uncomfortable, but the pain felt like stretching not ripping as it had in hospital. Mt recovery was hours. Not weeks. I was up, walking, and energetic within the hour. I had guests and had significantly less issues activating to motherhood of 2 than I expected given my previous experiences. 

I am now pregnant with #3 and am experiencing the same pressures I had with my first from traditional medical doctors. PTSD symptoms are returning and it's really hard to know whats accurate information and what is a lie from people who are not comfortable with home birth. I have had to fire two people responsible for my care because they lied to us about gestational dibeties effects, scheduled a csection without my consent, and transfered my care from midwife to OB without my knowledge. 

I am in canada where midwives are highly skilled, trained, specialists in labour and delivery in both home and hospital settings.

The mechanism is pretty simple:  he stresses you out, making you fearful and confused, then turns around and is sweet again, causing your system to be flooded with oxycotin hormones.  Those hormones give you the trademark euphoric high.

And that high is incredibly addictive.  Your system will crave it just as a junkie craves heroin--seriously, you might as well be shooting up.  The addiction will drive your life, just any other kind of addiction does.

And addictions LIE to you.  They tell you that you can't live without the object of your addiction, that no one understands how special it is, it's the only thing that truly loves you.  Your trauma bonding will compel you to do things you never thought you would ever do in order to keep you close to its dealer.

I don't use that phrase lightly:  your abuser is also your dealer.  That's why it is so hard to pull people out of abusive relationships:  the trauma bonding has terraformed their brains, convincing the victims that they will die if they don't hang on for that next sweet, sweet hit of euphoria.

Leave.  Leave quickly.  Leave completely.  If you live together, gather up only those things of greatest importance and LEAVE.  Talk to someone at either loveisrespect or thehotline for advice on how to safely leave.

Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  If you won't leave for yourself, leave for the people who love you, who don't want to lose you to an addiction.

Leave.",3

I offer ketorlac, but that requires an IV (as opposed to quick intranasal fenanyl via an atomizer) and some time to work. So, it's going to be an extra 15-20 min of starting a line, pushing the drug, and waiting a bit. Or we can just go ahead and move them but it's going to be agonizing.

 A abertura de apuração partiu de pedidos dos senadores Eduardo Girão (Podemos-CE) e Luiz Carlos Heinze (PP-RS). Apoiadores do presidente Jair Bolsonaro na CPI, eles dizem que foram vítimas de calúnia e injúria.

 No artigo de opinião, Celso de Barros afirma que o presidente Bolsonaro é defendido por senadores que buscam “tumultuar a investigação mentindo sobre medicina”. O grupo foi chamado de “Consultório do Crime” pelo autor.

 Girão e Heinze são os principais representantes desta ala dentro da CPI, segundo o colunista da **Folha**.

 Nesta terça-feira (25), Celso de Barros informou à Polícia do Senado que não irá participar da videoconferência marcada pelos investigadores.

  “Não é atribuição da Polícia do Senado investigar supostos delitos contra a honra de senadores da República”, afirmou o sociólogo, em petição assinada pelos advogados Luís Francisco Carvalho Filho e Phillipe Alves do Nascimento.

 O colunista da **Folha **declarou, na mesma resposta, que os senadores são integrantes da bancada bolsonarista, ""empenhada em instituir no Brasil um regime de arbítrio e de intimidação, conspirando permanentemente contra a liberdade de expressão e de imprensa”.

 Os senadores integram a tropa de choque de Bolsonaro dentro da CPI e defendem o uso de medicamentos sem eficácia contra a Covid-19, como a hidroxicloroquina e a ivermetina.

 Durante as primeiras reuniões da CPI, Heinze e Girão [citaram estudos científicos inconclusivos, erraram dados ou omitiram informações ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/05/tropa-de-choque-do-governo-cita-estudos-inconclusivos-sobre-covid-19-na-cpi-veja-checagem.shtml)sobre trabalhos que mostrariam benefícios do tratamento precoce.

 O senador pelo Rio Grande do Sul registrou boletim de ocorrência contra Celso de Barros no último dia 10, data em que o artigo foi publicado na **Folha**.

 Heinze disse aos investigadores que o colunista tentou criminalizar a ""defesa legítima"" que faz na CPI, ""escudado em manifestações de renomados médicos e cientistas"".

 Girão procurou a Polícia do Senado no dia seguinte. O senador afirmou que sofreu calúnia ao ser apontado como ""cúmplice do Presidente da República na morte de mais de 100 brasileiros durante a pandemia”.

 No artigo, Celso de Barros disse desafiar ""Heinze, Girão, Osmar Terra (deputado federal e ex-ministro de Bolsonaro) ou qualquer outro cúmplice de Bolsonaro"" a apresentar um estudo em que o presidente seja responsável por menos do que 100 mil mortes até o fim da pandemia.

 Os congressistas defendem que os supostos crimes devem ser apurados pela Polícia do Senado, pois se consumaram dentro da Casa.

 O órgão, então, abriu um termo circunstanciado sobre a coluna publicada na **Folha**, instrumento usado para apurar infrações de menor potencial ofensivo.

 Celso de Barros faz alusão no artigo ao “Escritório do Crime”, grupo de assassinos de aluguel que atua no Rio de Janeiro, do qual faria parte o ex-policial militar Adriano da Nóbrega, morto em fevereiro de 2020.

 O presidente Bolsonaro disse, dias depois da morte de Adriano, que o ex-policial [era um herói na época em que foi homenageado pelo senador Flavio Bolsonaro.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/bolsonaro-diz-que-miliciano-morto-era-um-heroi-quando-foi-homenageado-por-flavio.shtml)

 Celso de Barros afirmou à **Folha** que os senadores tentam intimidá-lo. Ele disse ainda que o assédio judicial é uma rotina na ""era Bolsonaro"", assim como em governos que inspiram o bolsonarismo.

 ""Para uma turma que se dizia contra o politicamente correto, os bolsonaristas são sensíveis demais. Os senadores não querem ser responsabilizados diante da opinião pública por suas posições na CPI. O que está em discussão não é brincadeira. Quase meio milhão de brasileiros morreram"", disse o sociólogo.

 O criminalista Carvalho Filho afirmou ser ""lamentável"" que senadores não se conformem com o direito de crítica e acionem a Polícia do Senado para intimidar o colunista.

 Procurados, Heinze e Girão ainda não se manifestaram. O presidente do Senado, Rodrigo Pacheco (DEM-MG), também não respondeu à **Folha**.",1

Sex and love aren't synonymous. You can be deeply in love and have a not so perfect sex life and that's ok. Don't put unnecessary stress on yourselves for an idealistic view of what sex is. Or, try not to. It's not easy.

Sometimes things move too fast and all the sudden it feels like I'm being locked down and the adventure is over. She likes me, I like her, we've had sex, it's going great...and now I'm bored. It's a weird thing some of us do, I don't know why, but it has nothing to do with the other person and it's something inside of ourselves.

The second possibility is that this guy is a drug addict, and was enjoying you like a drug for a while, but in the end had to return to his true love (whatever his drug of choice is). I know this sounds crazy, but when I was younger I had an oxyconten addiction and I just immediately drifted away from this girl I was dating one day bc I got so into the drug.

All I can say is, it's probably got nothing to do with you, and everything to do with him.",1

If you have these you should be looking into finding a specialist just to be safe. If you have not been misdiagnosed morphea will never turn into systemic scleroderma but as noted misdiagnosis is pretty common.   


Oral steroids work well for getting you out of a flare and stopping the spreading which in most does not go away. Phototherapy has worked wonders for many morphea patients and is worth trying. AIP and other diets can work because they reduce inflammation or can single out food triggers some have.

I personally had a very rapid skin progression so was treated with methotextrate and steroids for a month then methotextrate and hydroxiqlorquine and now just methotextrate till October.

Now that person needs opiates to function to survive further Chemo, and those drugs are now being refused due to fear of a court case.

 He was on parish council, helped individuals with substance abuse problems previously, was a fundraiser and a great member of the community, but this has happened. Now I am looking into THC and CBD alternatives to help as there are treatments available proven to work and help against cancer. But we won't allow cannabis consumption (and even project 21 is not fully legal yet) because the individuals in power have an invested interest in a company known as British Sugar, the world's largest producer of cannabis. But hypocritical of the government and law makers if you ask me, making fuck loads of money off of something illegal.

Makes you wonder who the laws are there for... Certainly not not for Victoria Atkins an MP who previously held a role in government in regard to drugs ,and her husband Paul Kenward who is the MD of British Sugar. This was all outed in 2018, and magically she moved departments at the same time. Fucking corrupt as Russia.

Times need to change. It's 2021 not 1971. Your argument is a hindrance on progressive research for possible treatments because ""the law"" is correct all the time and must be followed. No, times change and people need to change with them. Prohibiting substances has not worked, ever. And when our ""betters"" earn money from bending and breaking the rules when they want to deal in those substances, what the hell is the law there for in the first place?

173,2021-05-24 06:35:37+00:00,"I can't find that post/comment of yours you mentioned. I'd be interested in that info.

You really should read Chasing the Scream by Johann Hari. It seems you believe that someone's dependancy is to blame on the Heroin and not a combination of the withdrawals they cause and bio-sociological factors like not having a job that makes you proud or not having a goal in life, family or friends you want to be present for.

I don't understand your line regarding the supposed pretty picture I painted? What is pretty about being on methadone for 5 years, having to loose limbs, getting abscesses and being financially ruined while failing at abstinence at least twice...

The people I got to meet at that place had been on street heroin for decades and will possibly never stop but if they wanted to they'd be helped by the Diamorphin Programm to get into treatment.

I can't believe you use the term junkie to describe people with a dependancy on opiods. I'm 99% sure most of the people in my HAT would be called that by outsiders too but from someone with experience that's a fucked up choice of words imo! You should know better. For some reason it seems you think you're better than these people or that they are less worthy of being treated with dignity because they don't want to be abstinent? 

You can't tell me that any of your friends in the HAT were better off without it, can you? Just a legal dealer... That means no more stealing for heroin, no more jail cells or fines, no more abscesses and no more street garbage punched with fent. Just a legal dealer... 

I'm pretty sure the children you speak of would prefer their parents be in HAT than using street heroin, risking jail time or loosing custody wouldn't they? 
I'd assume they're spoiled ignorant brats but I'll wait for your link before I assume anymore. 

Lose all hope of getting better... You mean abstinent correct?",1
174,2021-05-24 04:55:03+00:00,"Parece que é ignorado o fato do crack ser uma droga altamente destrutiva e que mesmo em paises desenvolvidos  é uma droga que causa muita dor de cabeça ao poder publico.

Concordo que a situaçao social desfavoravel do país  acrescida da omissao do poder publico é um agravante , mas nao creio se um problema apenas das autoridades , o crack é uma força que transcende o lado social e humano , o pais pode ter a melhor medida relacionada ao consumo de drogas do mundo , se existir crack ou heroina ainda havera uma grande luta a ser travada.

Trabalhei por um tempo como voluntario e ouvi desbafos de muitas pessoas em situaçao de rua na regiao da cracolandia e uma vez um morador disse.

"" Fumar crack é como perder uma perna,  ja estamos com uma sequela e até podemos voltar a correr mas a maioria nao vai conseguir e os que conseguirem vao precisar de apoio pro resto da vida.""

Entao no meu ver as medidas ao combate de drogas so mais um fator do problema e passa longe de ser o principal fator. Enquanto isso existir vai ter gente perdendo tudo pro vicio ate no lugar mais preparado do mundo.

Nunca houve uma medida solida que foi eficiente na cracolandia em nenhuma gestao. Houveram sim esforços mas nem de perto amenizaram o problema.

Quando eu fazia trabalho voluntario na luz haviam alguns albergues da prefeitura que serviam para abrigar essas pessoas , sabe quem usava esses albergues ? os traficantes para vender drogas e prostituir as dependentes na luz do dia no meio dos corredores. a prefeitura nao podia fazer nada pois nenhuma conversa ia convencer os dependentes a procurarem ajuda ou tirar os traficantes dali.

Infelizmente desisti do trabalho por conta de ameaças , pois nao é de interesse dos traficantes que as pessoas sejam recuperadas pra cada um que procura ajuda eles dao pedra de cortesia pra outros 10. Hoje infelizmente sei por N motivos que o jeito de resolver esse problema nao é definitivo e nem Humano.
Nao vai ser politica de drogas flexivel nem sarau de poesia de jovem burgues ou oraçao de crente que vai resolver aquele problema",21

I broke my leg in October 2019 but since I was 17 at the time they wouldn't give me any painkillers or anything and set my leg while I was fully awake and feeling everything. Was the worst pain I felt in my life. Had to have surgery the next day on it and the first time they set it the day before the local er didn't set it right I guess (probably because I could feel everything and physically couldn't stay still) and at the downtown main campus hospital they had to reset it again but again since I was under 18 all I was given was a small vicodin dose which helped a tiny bit but still felt almost everything.

229,2021-05-23 21:16:16+00:00,"That's an assumption on your part and a horrible idea. If you get addicted to heroin and have to switch to an opiod that doesn't give you what you seek, 9 times out of ten that person will consume street heroin in Germany.

Giving that person access to diamorphin directly prevents further trauma, which can be the cause for a worsening dependancy!

But those are actually the guidelines here (which the docs want to loosen because too many people fall through the cracks):


I had to be on street heroin or methadone for at least 5 years. 

I had to have failed at least two attempts at getting clean or therapy. 


But that's completely fucked up. That's 5 years (10 in my case) of life your condemning someone to unnecessary pain!

This has to accessible as soon as you get addicted to street heroin. If you get addicted to methadone I'm sure that person is OK with methadone treatment but if he wanted to switch to diamorphin, what's the harm!?",1

The feeling is pure bliss. Felt like the first time I shot up. 100mg  of diamorphin + I believe 300 mg Substitol gave me energy for the day and made me feel happy not depressed. Saving the 30€ a day I'd spend on street heroin was the cherry on top.",2

Its not like Governor Stitt and Managed Medicaid would be a subject for that discussion. Hell didn't we have a pioneering lawsuit with Drug companies that criminally peddled Fentayl? What is the status on that with our government possibly electing to hand them patent rights to a vaccine we federally researched and funded. Oh, there are going to be an end to additional federal unemployment assistant and we are not protecting people from mass eviction &amp; foreclosures.

You can put on whatever shoes you like to choose but dont say I made you wear them. Honestly, it irks me about how people are naive about the government and willing to take this stuff for wholesale. Ultimately, I think the politicans and larger media sources that are promoting it are the only racist that they thinly cloaking it under Red Scare baiting. Sorry if you get red ears on the matter its not my intention. 

I provided you with a thought out post and just mainly think its up to Mods to remove this naive stuff. Hope that if you are such a curious person you don't leave it to reddit to do your work. Hopefully you can see bigger economic matters at play as you continue your work with the homeless.",1

233,2021-05-23 19:06:30+00:00,"Thanks for sharing. My ideal world might be legalization with a government monopoly on supply to keep the prices very high -- but that is impossible because the black market would readily develop. There's much less of a black market in tobacco due to volume and logistics -- the volume of (say) fetanyl needed to overdose the entire global population might fit in my car. Compare that to the logistics and land needed to grow many tons of black market tobacco. 

I think you're making more of a case for legalization (or decriminalization) of possession for personal use, rather than full legalization of the sort that would make the black market disappear.",1

237,2021-05-23 15:56:05+00:00,"Money, propaganda, as a tool of control, to placate, to numb, to lead you to feel you actually have worth working for when the weekend comes because you go out and spend all your money on something that alters your perception if reality for maybe 4 or 6 hours during the only 48 hours of the week you get to yourself.

Honestly, all that is true, but what I still don't get too well, is how it's the only hard drug to have ever been illegalized, then re-introduced back into the market, when we've had such a hard time getting Marijuana legalized even for the sickest of sick.

(Actually Marijuanas illegalization was due in no small part to an immense propaganda campaign and the belief by American Christian missionaries who would 'spread the message' in Mexico at the time, that the hispanic people were smoking Marijuana and that it had made them savages. (Really, what it was they were doing was simply every-day things, however our missionaries of course saw normal human behavior through the lens of good Ol' homegrown racism.

Marijuana was illegalized in the US before it had even really had a chance to become introduced and take any sort of root in our market.


However, back to the point.

I get that prohibition was dangerous, and ultimately failed, and was also the opportunity to collect more taxes, as well as prevent people from doing stupid black market things.

I don't understand why we STILL haven't taken a page from say Norways books and decriminalized all drugs (or atleast the most detrimental to us currently, methamphetamine, especially Heroin). And then introducing not 'safe-injection' sites, but 'safe-use' sites where people, if they choose to keep using, arrive twice a day and are given a usable, medical grade dose of pharmaceutical Diacetylmorphine (heroin), where they can then use it in the vicinity of other people, in case they overdose (which should rarely if ever happen), especially because it will he pharm. Grade, from a pharmaceutical company, no risk of adulterants like fentantyl, research chemicals, or cuts that could kill you.

Personally, I believe it's probably people's either inability or unwillingness, to see heroin use in the context of the situation I was previously talking about. And are unable to see the clear and present, proven facts, that when we decriminalize drugs, and reroute people who are found to have them or a problem with them, to resources like social services, etc. Instead of jail; especially when combined with safe use locales that function basically as a doctors office for safe, medical grade drug use. (Which, medical grade heroin lasts much longer, has less negative side effects , leads you to be able to go further in-between doses...)


...all together, resulting in a situation where addicts A) don't have to spend all of their time scheming how to make their next buck, breaking the law, stealing, committing property crimes, etc. All to B) afford their next hit of unclean, unpredictable drugs of varying purity. Leading them to C) turn into (as proven by the models represented in European countries over the last few years), functioning, productive members of society no longer taking up tax payer money to be in and out of jail, because another perk is that when you legalize heroin, you obviously destigmatize the addiction, hence they have a safe place to do it and it no longer harms their social and familial lives. And the cleaner drugs on a 2x a daily prescribed schedule, all the while covered by insurance or either either much cheaper than an actual drug addiction, so they no longer commit the petty crime largely committed by addicts either in the throes of withdrawl or planning to avoid.


Idk where I'm going with this, I just strongly believe in decriminalizing all drugs. Any chance I have to maybe spit something out that could lead a dissenter to maybe look into what I'm saying, and see the benefits greatly out-weigh any potential cons, and possibly lead them to see the light and logic of it all, I will, lol.",1
238,2021-05-23 15:37:28+00:00,"Margaret's arms ached as she reached down for another leaf of the damp, low grade pulp they called paper. As she tacked it to her makeshift easel she could not avoid spoiling the sheet further with her stiff and clumsy fingers. Her hands were unrecognisable to her - once spotlessly clean, pink and manicured, now filthy and putrid, with open sores and swelling where the toxic paint had seeped into her flesh, permanently staining them forever. She will be lucky if she has any hands left by the time this war is over. But she mustn't stop. She can't stop. She straightens her back on her stool and braces herself. After allowing herself a moment to collect whatever is left of her strength her voice waivers as she calls out, ""Bring in the next one""

After last night's shelling she was one of only a small number of artists left in her regiment. She had no time to mourn for her lost friends - the botched counter attack of this morning saw to that. She was on her 24th portrait already, and she knew her day was far from over. Mercifully by the time they arrived in her tent most of the men had lost consciousness or had been dosed with morphene so that she was spared their dying screams. She wondered if the rumours were true that the morphene was running out and shuddered. It was bad enough painting their mutilated bodies when they weren't writhing in pain or screaming for their mothers.

An exasperated medic called Johnson brought in the next soldier and Margaret almost fell over as she leapt back from her stool. He was wheeled over to the bench and Johnson started unloading the man's separated body parts from his trolley and attempted to position them in a way that looked natural. Johnson wretched and vomited as he did this, adding to the already thick and stinking air within the tent. When Margaret was drafted the sergeant told her that she would be thankful for the fumes of her paint one day, and now she knew why. She looked into the soldiers open eyes and knew that she had to work quicky as they started to flutter. If the painting didn't capture his essence then it wouldn't work and he would be trapped until it was done properly. That was why she was here. They tried to teach the men to paint each other's portraits but most lacked the ability to paint a fence, nevermind their friend's Release Portrait. The ones that were capable were rendered useless by the damage done to their nerves by the war. 

Margaret sat back down and checked her pallet and saw only the earthy colours that she needed. Black, brown, green, red. On the occasions where she could see a mans exposed teeth or bone then she could use white, but she had to be sparing. This was her worst case yet. Margaret takes another breath and reminds herself ""You must release him Margaret. He has a mother who needs his picture  you must be strong"". She repeats this as she wills her aching hands to the grip of her pencil and starts to outline the shapes as closely as she can, this way she can apply the paint without having to look at her decaying model. 

The set, as they called it, is kept as simple as possible so that the paintings can be done quickly. She can do thime set by memory, and does so a quickly as her ruined hands will allow. She starts to paint the dismembered man in the bench. As she focusses on her work a blood curdling scream explodes from the man, the blood that had been pooling in his mouth is sprayed over the tent and Margaret screams ""Johnson! Johnson! Quickly, Johnson, please, please hurry"". After too many moments of horror Johnson arrives and injects the man with morphene. He looks apologeticly at Margaret. Johnson stays until the man is settled and asks Margaret if she's ok. She isn't, but another scream outside means that Johnson is needed elsewhere and he bolts through the opening of her tent, leaving her om her own again.

Margaret sits down again to finish her portrait and sees the man's arm on the floor. She knows what she has to do. She can't call Johnson for this. She moves over and holds her breath. She bends down and pinches the sleeves of the arm so that she can pick it up without touching the skin. It's heavy. The weight reminds her of lifting a baby from its cot but she expells the thought from her mind as quickly as it came to her. ""Don't you dare Margaret. Not here"". 

Margaret replaces the arm as best as she can and resumes her seat. She finishes the portrait and sees the man finally release his last long breath. Margaret breaths and turns to ring a bell to signify she is finished. As they remove the body she removes the painting with her shaking hands and pegs it up on the line at the back of her tent. The man's name and rank will be written on the back, right next to the splatters of his coughed up blood. Margaret shudders at the thought of the man's family seeing it when his portrait is handed over. She moves back to her stool and lifts another piece of paper. She sits for a moment and collects herself.

""Bring in the next one""",4
239,2021-05-23 15:20:08+00:00,"I mentioned growing my own stuff to rebut the ""spending all my paycheck"" deal. Doing heroin daily will cause significantly more damage to you than cannabis, but no, it still wouldn't mean you're addicted. 

Addiction is not just a nasty habit, addiction is a complex psychological and physiological construct. It is characterized mainly by intense withdrawal, resulting from a newfound dependency on the item. No different than how it would feel to be hungry, the substance has become a regular and recognized addition to your biochemistry.

Using something daily does not guarantee addiction however likely it may make it depending on the substance. I am not addicted. I know that factually, as factually as I know my leg isn't currently broken. Addiction would be just as obvious. 

I smoke daily. A good amount too. But I've taken plenty tolerance breaks and each time I was fine. Worst I felt was some morning sweat and nausea. Indeed anything you do daily and kick for any amount of times will cause some sort of withdrawal, but this does not classify addiction. 

Beyond that, cannabis is not chemically addictive where heroin is. You can become somewhat addicted or dependent psychologically to almost anything, but substances like heroin are highly chemically addictive.

Mainly because they're designed to illicit an unnaturally intense dopamine reaction. This can't really be achieved by cannabis unless you do an extremely significant amount in a short period of time. Cannabis is, of course, just a plant, where heroin is a chemical compound called dimorphine that is explicitly designed to be extremely sedative and dopamine rushing. 

There just really is no comparison. Refer to active/lethal dose and dependency charts, you'll see cannabis and heroin are at completely different ends of the graph. Literally. Heroin is at the worst portion (most dangerous and addictive) where cannabis is at the best (least dangerous and addictive) second only to the safest common drug, shrooms.",2

248,2021-05-23 14:13:46+00:00,"It's really simple:

Give people what they're dependent on until they can and want to stop themselves. It's not a perfect solution but it's much better than the alternative.

Thanks to universal healthcare my all my meds are paid for. If at all I pay what is called a ""Rezept Gebühr"" of 10€ every two months.

Canada is definitely doing a better job at caring for people than the US but it's still a far cry from where it needs to be. Hell even here in Germany things are moving to fucking slow.

It's been over 10 years since diamorphin treatment was legalized and we only have about a dozen treatment centers that care for ca. 800 people (there are 80.000 people in Methadon Programms in Germany), it's completely fucked.

We're talking about lives and the health of millions of people worldwide but the UNODC bullies nations into repressing their own people to this very day.

Diamorphin Maintenance Treatment is what people that shoot up methadone need! I doubt any of them would prefer methadone over Pharmaceutical grade Heroin.

I'm trying to understand this obsession with sobriety.

Is it jealousy, parroting or some form of deeper understanding of opiod dependance treatment that scientifically proves why feeling euphoric or good is a bad thing (especially if a dependancy already exists!)?",1

Du kannst dein Leben lang täglich Diamorphin (Heroin) konsumieren, wenn du es als Reinstoff hast, der nicht von Kriminellen Druglords, sondern von einem pharmazeutischen Hersteller unter den Bedingungen, die auch für alle anderen Medikamente gelten, hergestellt wird
 https://medikamio.com/de-de/medikamente/diaphin-10000-mg-pulver-zur-herstellung-einer-injektionsloesung/pi     

und ein ganz normales, langes und gesundes Leben führen, ohne das der Stoff irgendwelche Schäden anrichtet. Klar, wenn du dich überdosierst und nicht schnell Hilfe bekommst, dann wars das. Die Muskulatur, die zur Atmung nötig ist, funktioniert nicht, weil sie gelähmt ist. Oder du liegst auf dem Rücken und bist weggetreten und erbrichst, woran du dann auch erstickst - typischer Rockstar Abgang halt. Man muss schon seine Dosis kennen und  wissen, was man nicht tun darf.

Ich bin seit nem halben Jahr im Diamorphin Programm und mein Leben hat sich in so vielen Bereichen drastisch verbessert:
-Gesundheit, Blutwerte, speziell Leber, ich habe wieder  normalen Appetit und Hungergefühl

-Finanziell, das Geld, das vorher für junk draufgegangen ist, kann ich jetzt benutzen um zu Leben
Hab meine Schulden bezahlt

-Keine Straftaten mehr, weil ich versorgt bin. Ich kann bis zu 3 mal am Tag dahin. Am Anfang wurde die Dosis  in kleinen Schritten erhöht, bis ich gesagt hab, dass ich zufrieden bin. Ich hab eine max. Dosis mit der ich mich richtig Breit machen kann, wenn mir danach ist. Das wird dann auf 2 Spritzen aufgeteilt zur Sicherheit. Außerdem hab ich noch ein Rezept für Substitol, dass ist retardiertes Morphium.

-Sozial, seit langer Zeit, vieleicht sogar zum ersten mal, fühle ich mich als Teil der Gesellschaft, ich kann aufrecht stehend meinem Gegenüber ins Gesicht schauen, ohne Scham oder Hintergedanken, ich gehe durch Geschäfte ohne zu scannen, wo die Kameras sind oder wer ein Ladendetektiv ist
Ich habe wieder Kontakt zu meiner Familie, besonders zu meiner Tochter.
Ich muss  keine Umwege mehr gehen, weil irgendwo
die Polizei ihre Streife zieht
Hab wieder Kontakt zu Freunden, mit denen ich seit Ewigkeiten nicht geredet hab

-Beziehung, meine Libido ist zurück. Wenn ich meine Freundin anschaue, sehe ich wieder die Schönheit in ihr, physisch als auch geistig,. Charakterlich und seelisch. Das Verlangen nach ihr ist wieder so stark wie vor Jahren, als ich mich in sie verliebt habe.
Ich bin unglaublich dankbar, so eine Frau an meiner Seite zu haben, die so viel Scheiße mit mir mitgemacht hat und dennoch immer zu mir gehalten hat.

Keine Ahnung wo du das mit den epileptischen Anfällen 
gehört hast... Wahrscheinlich meinst du die sogenannten  ""Shakes""?! Die bekommt man von Stoff, der mit Rattengift gestreckt ist, also auch wieder Stoffe, die nicht da reingehören...
Sowas gibt's wohl in den USA, die haben aber auch anderes Zeug. In Europa gibts nur die braune Heroin Base, die mit sogenanntem Laufmittel gemischt ist um es auf Alufolie rauchbar zu machen. Zum spritzen muss man es mit Ascorbinsäure aufkochen, wobei man die Base in Hydrochlorid umwandelt und wasserlöslich macht.
Ich habe fast 20 jahre Erfahrung, aber von epileptischen Anfällen hab ich noch nie was gehört....

If you include kratom as substance abuse(I certainly do) then i havent been a day sober in almost 10 years. Started on ocycontin and traded addictions until I ended up here.

And also, my job field is in its busy season currently, and in working like a madwoman just to stay caught up. Lastly my boyfriend travels for work but is quitting next month, he is gonna ensure my ass stays on the couch the first few days and hold all my money to stave off temptation! 

I'm actually excited in a way to quit, I want to know myself again and lose a lot of this self hate I have for being an addict. Thank you for listening",1

283,2021-05-23 00:50:18+00:00,"If able I would try and go into an inpatient program. I tried quitting meth and herioin many times and the only thing that has helped was being somewhere safe that was structured. It was a lot of fun and after 120 days I moved into a halfway house. Lived there for 9 months. These interventions allowed me to live through the urges, cravings, and feelings that I would have acted on if I was in my normal using environment. I would have 100 percent used. I injected meth and heroin for years, and thought I was just hopeless and had to rock it until the wheels fell off. I found out that is not the case, recovery is doable but you need to take some suggestions from others who have been there. It's not a secret skill you have to learn somewhere. It's simple just listen to what people in the rehab suggested and carry out the instructions. That's how I have been doing it (so far).",2

305,2021-05-21 21:02:26+00:00,"This is so true. I worked as a hospice aide before and I can 100% concur. 

Another point to this, though, is that we treat pain differently in the hospital. Our goal in the hospital is to stay ahead of the pain rather than treating pain when there are signs i.e. grimacing, moaning, thrashing and so on. Usually, when someone is dieing in the hospital, we have them in an IV drip which is continuously feeding IV morphine and/or fetanyl along with some saline to keep the vein from collapsing. This way, we can keep the patient from getting to the point of pain where they're moaning or thrashing. 

At home, people tend to medicate when there are signs of pain which leads to needing more medication to get the pain back under control. This means the person is showing more signs of breakthrouhg pain as their medication is going through peaks and valleys. If you're watching your loved one thrash around and cry in pain, you're gonna give them as much as you can until they're not thrashing around and crying anymore.",2
306,2021-05-21 19:40:48+00:00,"As a medical professional who specializes in oncology and hospice, lemme just add a little insight for you on how death is handled, at least in my state. Sorry for formatting, this might be a long one,  etc. etc. 

One of the biggest ethics ingrained into medical professionals from day 1 is ""do no harm."" I and many of my colleagues interpret this as sustain life as long as life is sustainable. Another big ethics rule is the patient has the right to choose. Now, I know there are doctors and nurses out there that are just awful and pushy but when you get to the hospice level of care you're going to be working with people who are truly passionate and care deeply about their work. 

A LOT of people choose all of the machines and ventilation and life-sustaining stuff, up to a point. Death is scary. Especially when you're staring down the double barrel of the grim reaper. And as a medical professional it is my job, within reason, to accommodate my patients wishes for themselves. Not just medically but also spiritually, familialy, and mentally. Death is a whole ass journey with many facets being very person specific. Curated death, so to speak. 

There is always a point where the doctor says we're out of options but at every step of the way, the patient has the right to choose. If you just wanna die and not take that next course of chemo or get those kidney drains placed, here's some oxy and fetanyl patches, maybe some ativan if you're anxious. And trust me, when you're on hospice or actively dying, we make sure you're comfortable. We have an ethical obligation to not let you overdose in the hospital but if you wanna go home and slap on all your patches and rail all your pills for one last hurrah, we are not stopping you (unless you have the Karen of all hospice nurses but they usually don't last long in the hospice world cuz we are all about dying with dignity which means death on your terms).

On the flip-side, what if you for whatever reason cannot choose for yourself? Say you were in a horrible car accident that damaged multiple organs including your brain and the only thing keeping you alive is a vent system... who do we ask then? Obviously next of kin which could be a spouse, parent, sibling or child. So what happens when you don't get to choose, your mom does and she's not ready to let go? Well... legally we're required to follow the wishes of whoever is the court mandated medical decision maker. So your ventilated body ends up in a long term care facility with all the accoutrement. Feeding tubes, ng tubes, IV nourishment, ventilators, the works. I cannot stress this enough. Very rarely does somebody choose to end up there. I cannot think of a single case where an individual rather than a next of kin has chosen that. 

In emergency situations, when a patient is unresponsive and we cannot reach next of kin, we will perform life sustaining treatment. Usually just up to a point to stabilize a patient enough to then either ask the patient what they want or reach next of kin. Yet again, you do have a choice. Go to your primary care and ask to fill out a form called a POLST, which is a Physicians Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. Then register this form with your local hospital. This dictates your choices if you're ever in an emergency situation where you're unable to verbalize your choices for medical treatment. 

Sorry, again, I know that was long but it's incredibly important to understand that death is not a one-size-fits-all situation. When you're traversing such a deep gray area you have to make choices that benefit the most people and can accommodate the myriad of variations therein.",46

Second I watched the trial (court video) and based on my knowledge of toxicology (master's) and martial arts, a person not on drugs would not have died from that. Fundamentally there are 4 ways of suffocating someone: vascular constriction (what they called it a ""blood choke"", a person passes out due to lack of oxygen to the brain within 10 seconds and it takes about 3 minutes to do damage to the brain), breaking the trachea (very visible damage), oxygen deprived environment (eg drowning, also quite easy to tell), and chemical (depriving the blood from cycling the oxygen, e.g. carbon monoxide poisoning and fentanol overdose).

341,2021-05-20 15:32:51+00:00,"Was letztlich eigentlich nur ein Argument pro Heroin ist:

Tabakwaren sind reguliert und dekriminalisiert zu erwerben, das Risiko quasi schon so niedrig wie es bei der Natur der Sache geht. Und selbst damit ergeben sich zum Teil höhere Sterberaten als bei Heroin aus mehr als zweifelhaften Quellen, die aus Profitinteresse auch gern mal mit giftigem Stoff strecken (Fentadope) und stark schwankende Reinheitsgrade haben, je nach Quelle, Charge etc, was die Risiken einer Überdosierung erhöht.

Es ist übrigens auch nicht richtig, dass die reine Überdosierung das größte Risiko sei. Sie macht einen sehr geringen Teil der Todesfälle aus, fast vernachlässigbar. Die meisten Todesfälle kommen durch Mischkonsum und additiven Wechselwirkungen zusammen. Inbesondere durch Benzodiazepin+Diamorphin-Kombinationen. Ist vielen Konsument\*innen wenig bewusst, dass auch Benzos die am Tag zuvor eingworfen wurden durch ihre lange biologische Halbwertszeit gefährliche Wechselwirkungen mit Heroin haben können, da beide Atemdepressiv wirken und damit die Symptome einer Überdosierung hervorrufen: Atemstillstand, Bewusstseinsverlust, Tod.

Heroin wird heutzutage in Deutschland übrigens kaum noch gedrückt, das dürfte eine der seltensten Konsumformen geworden sein. Hier und da finde ich mal noch Spritzen in den Ecken wo ich so unterwegs bin, aber am gebräuchlichsten ist mittlerweile das Rauchen von Heroin. Das birgt weniger Infektionsrisiken (wenngleich es wie alles, was geraucht wird, nicht gut für Zähne und Zahnfleisch ist) und ein deutlich geringeres Risiko der Überdosierung, da der Konsum dauerhaft einigermaßen intakte Motorik bedarf. Genauer gesagt wird es nicht geraucht sondern von einer Folie verdampft, mit Feuerzeug darunter, und mit einem Röhrchen inhaliert. Wenn du langsam am abdriften bist, kriegste das nicht mehr koordiniert und unterbrichst den Konsum damit sofort. Da beim Inhalieren der Effekt nahezu sofort eintritt, ist auch die wirkende Aufnahme damit zeitnah unterbunden und tödliche Überdosierungen sehr selten. An zweiter Stelle dürfte das Schnupfen folgen, aus offensichtlichen Gründen. Das geht sehr bequem heimlich.. erst dann dürfte Drücken kommen, Schlucken schließlich als letztes wegen der unglaublich schlechten Effizienz und so billig ist der Stoff dann auch nicht ;)

Bedenkt mensch all diese Faktoren, so spricht alles für eine Dekriminalisierung und Regulierung, da damit *alle* Risikofaktoren angesprochen und verringert, zum Teil gänzlich eliminiert, werden können.

356,2021-05-19 22:56:24+00:00,It's legal in my state but back in 2016 it wasn't. I applied months to bestbuy before hand. I got super stoned and the next day they called for a interview and I was hired lol. They did a drug test and they didn't day anything and I still got the job. As long as you're good in the interview and don't smell or high ur good. Unless they are super strict the main point of the drug test is for hardcore narcotics like meth herioin and some prescribed drugs. Which if It's prescribed as long as you have a real doctor's note for it you will be fine. So I wouldn't worry about it.,1
357,2021-05-19 20:43:22+00:00,"Recovery may be possible, but some of the things do make you a permanent failure at life. Some acts aren't forgivable. My ex got hooked on fentanyl and meth by a junkie crowd. They stole over $100,000 from our home and spent it all on you guessed it, drugs.

Home invasion robbery, and it left me barely able to walk after being injected with drugs, kept out for days, beaten while I was out.

I was just about to open up a small business and get custody of my daughter. Now I've lost that costudy, what I was putting into her 529 account, my mobility and strength, and lost my fiancee to meth and fentantyl. 

They're miserable pieces of shit, wastes of space that if they continue their behavior, will die, and the world will be a better place for it. There's no forgiveness, and there's nothing they can do to solve my CPTSD, spinal damage, neck damage, tailbone damage, small fortune gone, custody of my daughter gone, small business gone, and ex gone now to being pimped out by you guessed it, more addicts. Those things make them permanent failures at life. One mistake can cost you that much, and the drugs, when you do them, don't cause you to make those choices. They definitely skew things to enable you to, but the responsibility ultimately lies with the person(s) doing them.

Let's not pretend that it's just about the addiction and rug part, because it's not. It may be a disease, but it doesn't negate responsibility for the horrible actions that so many addicts are okay with while they're high.",4
358,2021-05-19 20:39:43+00:00,"I rejected the epidural option and they only let me be on opiates for 30 hours post-surgery, then switched me to Tylenol because of a family history of everyone but me in my immediate family becoming addicted to either alcohol or cigarettes and only one of them successfully quitting. I used the dimorphine pump just barely enough to numb the worst pain a little because of my fear of becoming addicted to anything, and the fact it turned my anxiety up to 11. I’m asking for the epidural for my J-pouch surgery in hopefully a few months and just hoping it works for me at all, because it hasn’t worked for anyone I know who has gotten one.",1

394,2021-05-19 13:02:02+00:00," O Brasil está imerso em várias crises. A primeira e mais importante é a crise da democracia. Após décadas de construção democrática bem-sucedida, gerada pelo consenso em torno dos resultados eleitorais, a capacidade de implementar políticas sociais bem-sucedidas e maior confiança na democracia. Todos esses elementos se desintegraram rapidamente após o processo de [impeachment da ex-presidenta Dilma Rousseff](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2015/brasil-em-crise/o-impeachment-de-dilma/), cujo ponto de partida foi o não reconhecimento dos resultados das eleições de 2014.

 O processo de erosão da confiança na democracia foi também um processo de hiper-expansão das prerrogativas do sistema judiciário e das instituições de controle, muito além da desejada e necessária autonomia para a democracia. A Suprema Corte, especialmente, acumulou prerrogativas a partir de 2012 e começou a usar essas prerrogativas politicamente. Enquanto isso, a [Operação Lava Jato](https://arte.folha.uol.com.br/poder/operacao-lava-jato/), inicialmente uma operação anticorrupção, tornou-se uma operação fortemente politizada. Nas eleições presidenciais de 2014 e 2018, o então juiz Sérgio Moro agiu politicamente.

 Finalmente, ressurge o problema militar. O Brasil deixou o problema da interferência militar na política sem solução durante sua transição para a democracia. O [artigo 142 da Constituição ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/06/entenda-a-discussao-sobre-o-artigo-142-da-constituicao-que-trata-das-forcas-armadas.shtml)permite a intervenção dos militares para garantir a lei e a ordem. Desde a desastrosa missão no Haiti, a liderança de um setor antidemocrático nas Forças Armadas foi fortalecida. Os principais líderes da missão no Haiti, os generais Braga Netto e Augusto Heleno (este último acusado de graves violações dos direitos humanos no Haiti) ganharam proeminência na liderança das Forças Armadas, que hoje entra na arena política e exerce pressão sobre as instituições democráticas.

 Jair Bolsonaro e seu governo são o resultado dessas formas de relativização da democracia pelas elites políticas, judiciais e militares no Brasil. Bolsonaro foi uma figura política inexpressiva até 2017. Até então, o bolsonarismo era mais um movimento do que uma forma de governo e a candidatura do capitão reformado era vista como uma candidatura de protesto.

 Bolsonaro catapultou-se para o centro da cena política em alguns episódios: no julgamento do impeachment da ex-presidente Dilma, ele ganhou destaque ao defender a memória do torturador [Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml); no episódio do julgamento do habeas corpus do ex-presidente Lula da Silva, ele fez parte da articulação do Estado-Maior das Forças Armadas que pressionou a Suprema Corte. Finalmente, Bolsonaro e sua comitiva se beneficiaram da intervenção militar no Rio de Janeiro e do grande impulso para as políticas das milícias que ele tornou possível.

 O problema de Jair Bolsonaro desde o início de seu governo tem sido estabelecer alguma relação entre o movimento para atacar o sistema político que ele dirigia e algo que expressasse minimamente uma certa capacidade de governar. Bolsonaro trouxe poucos políticos com qualquer capacidade gerencial para seu ministério como Sérgio Moro, Onix Lorenzoni ou Luís Henrique Mandetta, mas quase imediatamente o foco da ação governamental foi em ministros fortemente ideológicos como o ex-ministro da Educação Abraham Weintraub ou o ministro do Meio Ambiente Ricardo Salles.

  Desde o início da pandemia do coronavírus, a ideia de substituir políticas públicas metódicas por formas ideológicas de gestão tem impactado o Ministério da Saúde com resultados trágicos para a população brasileira. Bolsonaro havia nomeado Luiz Henrique Mandetta para o Ministério da Saúde, um ministro com perfil centrista e formação técnica na área, em absoluta dissonância com quase todos os outros membros de seu ministério. Assim, a crise do coronavírus caiu nas mãos de um ministro centrista, em um governo que quase não tem centristas, e de um ministro com capacidade técnica.

 Jair Bolsonaro investiu para interromper a resposta brasileira à pandemia. Primeiro, ele investiu contra a política de isolamento social e, em 16 de abril de 2020, o capitão conseguiu implementar sua política anti-vida com a demissão do ministro da Saúde Luiz Henrique Mandetta.

 Após a posse do novo ministro, general Eduardo Pazuello, o governo desativou as inter-relações federais no momento decisivo da luta contra a Covid-19, depois concordou em prescrever à população remédios de eficácia não comprovada e finalmente desorganizou completamente a campanha de vacinação no país. O resultado, ou mortes, não demorou a aparecer e até este momento o Brasil está vivendo sua maior crise de saúde, que é também uma crise política.

 O governo Bolsonaro enfrenta dois conflitos que já selaram seu destino como um governo fraco: um conflito com o Congresso e um conflito com a Suprema Corte. Bolsonaro teve episódios diferentes com o Congresso durante seus dois anos no cargo. No início da administração do capitão, a tensão entre o governo e o Congresso estava sobre as agendas relacionadas com armas e educação superior, ao mesmo tempo em que o presidente da Câmara viabilizava a agenda econômica do bolsonarismo.

 Estamos vivendo agora um confronto de dimensões muito maiores: com a abertura de uma [comissão de investigação no Senado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/cpi-da-covid/), a oposição e os membros independentes da Câmara estão assumindo a liderança nas investigações sobre o desempenho do presidente e de seus ministros na pandemia.

 O segundo conflito do presidente é com a Suprema Corte. No primeiro ano de governo, a Suprema Corte manteve uma posição de equidistância do governo, intervindo ocasionalmente em alguns conflitos. Com o início da pandemia, os conflitos entre a Suprema Corte e o governo Bolsonaro se intensificaram, especialmente após a decisão da corte em favor da autonomia dos governadores e prefeitos para lidar com a pandemia. A relação tornou-se ainda mais tensa com as ações do decano da corte em relação à interferência política do presidente.

 Esses dois conflitos que o presidente Jair Bolsonaro enfrenta são incomuns em uma democracia em funcionamento. São a expressão de um populismo autoritário que procura reforçar as ações de um presidente que não tem nenhuma preocupação com a governança ou que a transformou em opiniões sobre a pandemia, a vacinação e o pacto federal.

Plus the superiority complex present in conspiracy theorists as well for having found the truth most others don't.


So if it's someone deep into the homeopathy church, I won't say anything anymore. Just not worth my time. If it's a random person coming to the pharmacy and asking for Arnica D30, read from a note, then yea I'm gonna tell them to just not buy anything. It's bullshit and explain what homeopathy is.


Them there's the even crazier people like this kinda alternative couple coming in with a bottle of water with what looked like mud and some Amazonian rainforest plant that was supposed to cure Diabetes.

They wAnted a homeopathic remedy made from that.

I tried explaining to them, that even for homeopaths that would be a crazy idea. If said plant did treat diabetes, then making the homeopathic dilution would make something that causes diabetes.

But whatever, the money they offered was enough for me to go through all the bullshit steps of making their remedy, and at the dilution I made it, it wouldn't have mattered if they had given me a bottle of hemlock 'tea'. Nothing dangerous in it anymore.



The anti intellectualism that has been festering in all western countries is a huge danger on its own as well.

Luckily don't encounter many antivaxxers as arguing at work, cause vaccines are done by physicians here, and we provide the vaccines directly to the physicians unless it's rarer stuff not paid for by insurance, like traveling into rabies infested areas and getting the rabies vaccine.
But if someone hands me a prescription for that, the doctor must have convinced them that it's a good idea.



Though there've been people picking up their narcotics mentioning some random news about vaccines and how they wouldn't be putting that stuff in their bodies... Yea sure. You are being prescribed 160 mg of oxycodon a day, I don't think vaccines are in any way a danger to you..",20

481,2021-05-18 09:59:59+00:00,"Before you jump in to a pump, you should be on an ER version of an opioid. A pump is really a lot to go through and there are risks involved that no doctors will discuss. Granulomas in particular, hard *sharp* deposits of biologicial material (white blood cells, antibodies, etc) that can literally saw in to nerves or the spinal cord. I knew a guy for a short time that was in a wheelchair from that very thing happening and the worst part is he was a Pain Doc before it happened. They've known about this issue since at least the 70's.

There are other drugs besides opioids that they'll use in a pump. Prialt is only used in them. If I am not mistaken most pumps these days have a button you can hit to trigger a rescue dose, but how often you use it makes a difference in the refill date. And its not like you can walk in to any pharmacy and get it filled. Come to think of it, even the pills can be hard to fill at some pharmacies.

You'd probably have a difficult time getting Xanax and morphine at the same time. There's a 1.5% chance of respiratory arrest which most docs think outweighs the benefits to the patient. You can't really depend on what a medical provider tells you about the relative strength of an opioid. A Percocet is enough to knock out a 200lb man if they've never had any experience with an opioid. It was many years ago but my 4'11"" 90lb grandma was put on Brompton's Syrup (Morphine and Cocaine) at home just before she passed and she was zooming around the kitchen and rest of the house like it was nothing. Just like pain, pain relief is all relative. This was before the ER drugs came out. You should talk to your doc about something like MSContin before you let them carve to put in a pump. Just about every opioid there is now has an extended release version that prvide round the clock relief. If your present medication regimen isnt cutting it, it's important to notice how its inadequate. Is it not strong enough or does it just not last long enough? Or both? You can be stable for a long time on an adequate dose of an ER opioid with no fuzziness whatsoever.....",1

First of all, drugs are a vice.  They sell addictive powders out of every house in my town.  We don't even have gangs shooting each other over ""turf"" that, i just saw a comedian point out, ""neither of them actually own!""

I, however, don't have much bank these days.  Addictive powders are above my tax bracket.  So i only do free ones.  Hey-even the fetanyl people occasionally share.

Why can't you get a job?  I worked ""for real"" by fifteen.  Mowed lawns, shoveled snow, whatever i could get paid for before then.  No matter, i'll try to help you spend less on drugs instead.

Basically, choose wisely.  I never advocate ethanol to anyone under 25.  It takes that long for your brain to fully develop.  Start killing brain cells before then, you're literally trimming rather than enhancing your intelligence.  But beer is cheap and legal, it's almost impossible to od on it, and you can buy it damn near anywhere.

Green is my go-to.  That counts as medicine as much as a drug.  I love blunts but will never smoke tobacco again.  Quitting that one was a nightmare.

In the us, there's an oddball legal one called, colloquially, hippie crack. Technically, it's no2.  Laughing gas.  It has a bad reputation as a brainkiller, but that's undeserved.  Yes, it displaces your oxygen.  For one deep breath.  That's it.  If skipping one deep breath killed brain cells, i wouldn't be able to tie my shoes by now.  I swam competitively for over a decade.  Just stay away from nitrus masks.  No2 is easy to come by, o2 is impossible to get.  Only do the mask if you're with a dentist and having fun in the chair after hours.

And i don't inject.  Because science.  I don't know how to make an antibiotic; no way am i going to risk a blood infection to get high.  In my country, i'd then have to get two professionals, a doctor and a pharmacist, to give me some pills to fix it.  And both of them understand the above paragraph.  I wouldn't expect a lot of sympathy from them.

I think that's good advice overall, as you start out on your psychonautic journey through life.  Stick to the cheap ones until you earn better.  Watch your addictions until you have enough life you won't throw it away.  Good luck.",1

But that was heroin, fentanyl is another story for me. When heroin wasn't available anymore, I would snort the fenanyl constantly just to satisfy my cravings. And the high would only last about 30 mins, maybe? It was fucking pathetic.

I'm so happy I go on methadone and now currently tapering down 5mg every 2 weeks. Its been a struggle but I know ill get there eventually. One day at a time is how we addicts have to take it. Methadone has prevented me from using heroin for 1.5 years, longest streak ever! 

But now I'm finally ready to move on and started my taper a few months back. Using marijuana and on rare occasions, xanax, to help with the anxiety/withdrawal when it comes to tapering down off methadone.

525,2021-05-16 07:18:25+00:00,"All forms of scleroderma are diagnosed based on clinical symptoms blood tests can be used to look at antibodies which can be used to guess potential progression but not everyone with scleroderma has the antibodies we currently know of. 

&amp;#x200B;

For systemic scleroderma they will be looking for internal symptoms that are common include: raynauds, GERD/acid reflex, GI issues, abnormal nail bed capillaires, difficulty swallowing, PAH, shortness of breath, and much more. Generally you wont have these with morphea it can happen but these symptoms would lead a doctor to believe a patient has the systemic forms. 

&amp;#x200B;

Systemic scleroderma is a progressive disease so most will eventually have organ involvement unless they are fully in remission but you can come out of remission at any time. Most have the disease managed with medication to at the very least slow progression. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your mother should see a scleroderma specialist they know how to diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and to use the few tests we do have to differentiate the types like nail fold capillary tests. You can find scleroderma scecialists online by going to [scleroderma.org](https://scleroderma.org) or googling to find a local one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally have morphea mine was progressive with rapid skin involvment  and is now in remission with methotextrate. I had many other symptoms as well like itchiness, joint pain, fatigure and more. Morphea also ususally skips finger involment. However, there are other localized forms of scleroderma like linear scleroderma. So to get a proper diagnosis get her to a scleroderma specialist. This isnt a death sentence anymore there are many medications and treatment options to slow progression and even put individuals into remission.",2

529,2021-05-16 03:05:22+00:00,"I have an MCAS diagnosis and it was much worse when I first started transitioning (now it’s pretty mild). By the time I had top surgery I had a long history of having reactions to -codone and -morphone drugs, which is a common MCAS issue. For the weeks leading up to surgery I was extra careful about taking my meds (I was on h1 and h2 blockers, 4x the normal doses for both, and singulair). I gave my surgeon a list of commonly problematic drugs so the anesthesiologist modified my anesthesia a little bit. I got IV meds pre op to prevent issues (h1 and h2 blocker and I think a steroid). Instead of a -morphone during surgery I got fentanyl. Post op, I was given tramadol (instead of vicodin or oxycodone, which is what most people get). For my first couple days post op I also was given scheduled hydroxyzine (I react to benadryl) and zofran to prevent any issues in addition to my normal meds, and my post op antibiotic was one I had taken before without issues. Once I stopped needing the tramadol I switched to tylenol instead of an NSAID. Everything went smoothly, but I’d definitely suggest waiting on surgery until your symptoms are reasonably under control (I.e. not having frequent asthma attacks or frequently using epipens or anything like that). 

I’m not on gel T so I don’t have advice for that specifically, but I’d suggest asking your doctor if you can do your first dose in the office with supervision if you’re worried about a serious reaction. I was initially started on T enanthate shots and I ended up reacting to the oil it’s suspended in (mildly, I just got a rash on my leg). I switched to T cypionate shots and have had no problems.

530,2021-05-16 01:58:46+00:00,"I've had a psychiatrist look me in the face and say ""But you look fine!"" I had a therapist over the phone say ""well...You don't sound depressed."" I guess I was supposed to be a sobbing mess? I've had one therapist actually care and helped me get hospitalized in the psych ward when my SI was getting stronger and stronger and I wasn't seeing a way out of my situation - and overwhelmingly thought my husband would be better off with someone else. Fun times. 

But the worst response I ever had was from my father. I was 14 or 15 at the time, I was suicidal from all of the abuse he was putting me through, my mom was bed bound from having a stroke, and my dad thought it was a great idea to get back into drugs, alcohol, and run off with different women and come home when he felt like it. 

There's a lot more to this story but somehow he found out I was suicidal. I was in the kitchen and he came up to me with all of my mother's pills (Trazadone, oxycotin, etc. Sorry idk how to spell them lol) and one by one he put them in front of me and he said ""this one will stop your heart."" I blocked out the rest of the conversation except for the ending ""If you're going to kill yourself then kill yourself stop being a coward and kill yourself."" 

I haven't seen or spoken to that thing in over 10 years and I don't plan on it. My therapist once asked me if he was on his deathbed and he apologized and took responsibility for everything if I would forgive him for it. 

Idk what forgiveness is. But I said I would not. Nothing he says or does will ever undo the shit he did and what it did to my mentality. All I can do is when I have children to not raise them the way that I was, and I have to keep on living for as long as I can. Otherwise he would win - he would be right - and I'd rather go straight down to the pits than for that to happen.",1

537,2021-05-15 18:39:14+00:00,"I am one of those. I don't necessarily believe all of them, but I believe some of them to believe self evident. In a nutshell, I think that the ""powers"" or the ""dark energy forces"" or ""whatever name you want to use to describe decay and negativity use a multitude of tools to dumb down and depopulate the human race. ""They"" want to keep us in the dark. I think we agree that alcohol does just that. I always ask myself, and others, how could a logical and intelligent society have liquor stores on every single corner and sell substances that kill millions of people annually. Alcohol has killed, and will continue to kill, lots more people then a virus; either directly or indirectly. Well, the answer is money. The alcohol industry brings in tons of money and employs tons of people in the industry. This industry has lots of power. Not to forget, how can a government boycott a substance that the majority of the population actively uses...they can't. People would continue to use, as they did in the prohibition era, regardless of the laws. Humanity is also being dumbed down with the food that we eat. There is nothing natural or good from eating manufactures food that comes in a package and box. The level of poison that we take in is on a spectrum and obviously alcohol is higher on the spectrum than some Taco bell or Hamburger helper.

&amp;#x200B;

It's interesting because I am against having our freedom of choice taken away. But something tells me if Alcohol was banned society would be much better. Yet, that is impossible because one can make their own alcohol. Alcohol is addicting and once our primal brains get that hit of dopamine we only seek it more. Then we need more alcohol to fight off the anxiety that alcohol has caused by making our brains chemically out of whack. To me, selling alcohol is comparable to selling heroin, cocaine, or fetanyl at the local store. It has potential to do serious damage quickly. I guess when it comes down to it the only thing we can do is be personally responsible and not drink if we have issues. I certainly can't drink..I did a lot of research.

Congrats on your sober time. That is a huge accomplishment that not everybody gets to experience. Takes a lot of courage.

I've slowly come to one of the conclusions, that I have been more stressing on the goal to complete a game, then the way towards it and enjoying myself, what gaming should be all about. The more I think about it, the more I think it's a simple case of FOMO.

I think I also have come closer to the answer why I don't finish games:

1. Reading through all the comments made me realise I'm not the only one, which helped a lot.

2. My CD-ROM cases and old gaming laptops are filled with spreadsheets with data like stats with Football manager, build orders on RTS, etc. Basically data to fully optimize the best possible playthrough. That I currently work as a data analist/improvement manager actualy makes sense now. However looking back and evaluating my current playthroughs, this is leaning towards obsessive. I also recognise this in my work. Something I'll have to work on.

3. I seem to set the bar too high. Looking at my save files of the installed games on my PS4, all the loot based games have 100% filled storage with the intent to check/compare all the stats to have the best items. But I seem to quit the game as I can't find the energy/mood to go through all that data as it comes close to the work I do 40+ hours a week.

I'm not going to fool myself by saying I've/you've fixed me. But for now I'll try to focus more on enjoying playing games instead of obsessing on finishing the game.

I'll also take a break from games I will know I lose myself in stats, data and such. As I'm already seeing a therapist due to my illness and mental side effects of oxycodon, I'll address the obessive behaviour on being perfect on both gaming as work.

I wish to thank all of you who took the time to comment.",1

554,2021-05-14 18:16:56+00:00,"Not saying no physicians were to blame, but it's a bit more nuanced than that. Individual physicians don't set prescribing guidelines and at the height of the opioid overprescribing, pharmaceutical company-funded studies claimed that you couldn't get addicted to Oxycotin. 

There was a huge push to call pain the ""fifth vital sign"" and that there was an epidemic of untreated pain. Medicare reimbursement was changed to be partially based off of patient satisfaction surveys that included pain control, so hospital admins were also pushing physicians to prescribe more.

It should have been noticed sooner and some physicians definitely made a ton of money essentially being pill mills, but your average everyday physician was just following changing guidelines.",9

La CIA claramente intervino en política europea con GLADIO y otros organizaciones que abarcaron a grupos de ""inteligencia"" europea. Mataron a civiles en las plazas en Italia, robaron bancos en Bélgica y hicieron trato con las mafias para traficar heroina. Italia hubiera votado por el partido comunista si no fuera por estos intervenciones.

Fueron los comunistas que vencieron al Hitler y es solo gracias a una campaña mediática que se ha desprestigiado al contribución soviético. Las encuestas en Francia al final de la guerra afirman que Stalin venció a Hitler no sólo en la realidad pero en los ojos del pueblo europeo.

El plan Marshall era distinto, en vez de matar izquierdistas - los gringos buscaban aumentar el estilo de vida y condiciones en Europa occidental con fines de tener un mercado para sus exportaciones y servicios financieros y consolidar un bloque antisovietico (el OTAN). EEUU dio bastante financiamiento a Europa occidental y sus políticos implementaron programas sociales y beneficios laborales que no se ve en muchos lados capitalistas como método de satisfacer al clase trabajadora y mostrar un supuesto superioridad (que ignora el sufrimiento en el sur global necesario para mantener sus puestos relativamente privilegiados)

Ahora a treinta años de la caída del URSS podemos ver que Europa occidental ha retrasado en sus derechos laborales y programas sociales porque no ha habido ningún competencia fuerte o cercana.


Recién el mundo se dio cuenta que China es el futuro y entonces las cosas podrían cambiar. La Hilary Clinton recién dijo en Chatham House que los Chinos les están ganando y que hay que retomar los medios de producción.

A publicação, que foi feita no ano passado e voltou a circular agora, traz uma fotomontagem com o título alterado de uma reportagem da rádio Jovem Pan. No texto original, a chamada é “Recuperado, Dr. Roberto Kalil revela que tomou hidroxicloroquina e defende uso em casos graves” e, no post, “Recuperado, Dr. Roberto Kalil revela que tomou hidroxicloroquina e defende: ‘Tem que ser utilizada'”.

 Na entrevista à Jovem Pan, o médico contava como foi sua recuperação da doença e afirmava ter tomado hidroxicloroquina e outros remédios. Já naquela entrevista o diretor-geral do Centro de Cardiologia do Hospital Sírio-Libanês dizia: “Minha opinião é que, independentemente das ideologias, devemos procurar minimizar o dano à população e evitar mortes. Se existe medicação com evidências que pode haver benefícios, aliada a outras medicações, numa situação desta, tem que ser utilizada e pronto. Não tem conversa”. Em nenhum momento ele defende a hidroxicloroquina como a única ou principal responsável por sua recuperação.

  

 Em 10 de abril, dois dias depois da entrevista, [Kalil afirmou para a Folha que não era “garoto-propaganda de nada”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/nao-sou-garoto-propaganda-de-nada-diz-kalil-que-usou-outros-remedios-alem-de-cloroquina.shtml) e que seu tratamento incluiu uma combinação de remédios, não apenas a cloroquina.

 O post tira as afirmações de Kalil de contexto e utiliza-as um ano depois, quando o conhecimento sobre o uso da cloroquina contra a Covid já está mais avançado. Em outubro de 2020, a OMS (Organização Mundial da Saúde) afirmou que o tratamento é ineficaz e, em março deste ano, passou a contraindicá-lo em casos de Covid. No mesmo mês, quatro das seis fabricantes de cloroquina no Brasil já [não recomendavam o remédio contra o coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2021/03/maioria-dos-fabricantes-brasileiros-de-cloroquina-nao-recomenda-o-remedio-para-covid-19.shtml).

 O Comprova tentou falar com Kalil, mas sua equipe informou que ele não poderia responder às perguntas.

  Quanto ao autor da postagem no Facebook, a rede social não permitiu o contato direto com o perfil.

 ### Como verificamos?

 Buscamos as reportagens da rádio Jovem Pan sobre as declarações do médico Roberto Kalil Filho, e o vídeo completo da entrevista concedida por ele ao veículo, no ano passado.

 As assessorias de imprensa do médico e do Hospital Sírio Libanês, onde ele atua profissionalmente, foram procuradas, mas disseram à nossa reportagem que o cardiologista não teria disponibilidade para uma entrevista.

 O Comprova não encontrou declarações diretas do cardiologista sobre o uso da hidroxicloroquina em pacientes da Covid-19 após a publicação de diversos estudos que atestam a ineficácia do medicamento nesses casos. Por isso, buscamos em entrevistas e colunas assinadas por ele, em diferentes veículos, declarações recentes que dessem pistas sobre a visão dele sobre o assunto.

 Também buscamos os posicionamentos da OMS e de fabricantes da cloroquina e verificações nossas para averiguar o que mudou sobre o conhecimento científico que se havia em maio de 2020 e no mesmo mês deste ano.

 ### Por que investigamos?

 Em sua 4ª fase, o Comprova verifica conteúdos de redes sociais ligados à pandemia e a ações do governo federal. Priorizamos informações suspeitas que têm grande alcance, como o post analisado nesta checagem.

 Embora não tenha eficácia comprovada, a cloroquina vem sendo amplamente defendida pelo presidente e seus apoiadores. Isso pode significar um risco para a população já que as medidas eficazes conhecidas até agora, além da vacina, são o distanciamento social, restrição de circulação, uso de máscaras e higienização das mãos. Só assim o país vai diminuir os índices de contaminação e morte pela doença.

 No ano passado, quando o post com Kalil foi publicado, houve 183 mil compartilhamentos no Facebook. Desde 8 de maio de 2021, quando ele voltou a circular, já foram 6,6 mil compartilhamentos e 12 mil interações.

 Enganoso, para o Comprova, é o conteúdo retirado do contexto original e usado em outro de modo que seu significado sofra alterações; aquele que confunde, com ou sem a intenção deliberada de causar dano.

 ***O Comprova fez esta verificação baseado em informações disponíveis no dia 12 de maio de 2021.***

I had many symptom besides just spreading of the plaques, this included fatigue, joint pain, weird muscle fatigue, generalized itchiness. I noticed joint pain went from all the time to 2 days a week at the 8 week point of treatment. I initially was also put on presidone 10mg a day to get me out of a flare. At the  8 week point when I still had some joint pain we added hydroxychlorquine and after a month I was joint pain free. The itchiness was gone on the presidone but came back turns out i also got ezcema at the same time and would a year later be diagnosed with hydradentits suprativa. At 4-6mths mark on methotextrate i noticed my plaques slowed down. At 8 mths they stopped and I would say I have been in remission since. I will begin tapering in October to see if I stay in remission med free. I have also been off hydroxychloriquine for months now and that seemed to be what was aggrevating my HS.

Youll also be prescribed folic acid for your off days only take the amount  prescribed it interferes with the methotextrate and so does the hair meds. So you have to talk to your doctor about what youll  be allowed to take with it. Another thing to not is folinic acid is sometimes used in the case of more severe side effects.

Its like me as a person just left and someone else was in my body. Telling you this doesnt do it any justice to how fucked i was. I know you wont listen to me. If that was me asking this question back then i wouldnt have. But fuck dude trust me when i say before you know it will have taken everything from you. Especially if your self medicating man. If your depressed heroin is a big no. Withdrawals are hell man. But after withdrawals its not like your back to normal all is good. Your still addicted just not dependent. A surprisingly large number of people dont know that. Addiction is so hard to explain. I can tell you but it doesnt do it justice. Addiction is a life of pain and lonliness you get trapped and feel like theres no way out you lose control whatever you feel now it gets way worse. And btw its mostly fentnyl now extremely dangerous especially for someone who doesnt use a strong opiate. Cuz you never know how much is in there. But anyways so if you do decide to do trust me man dont make it a habit if you see yourself doing it more take a break from it for a while. Space it out so you dont get withdrawals. Addiction creeps on you and you dont even realize. Heroin is just too good. Dam dude sorry this is so long and its probably everywhere my adhd fucks me up😂 but i wish you the best man and btw kratom is nothingggg compared to heroin. Stay safe.",3

This makes for a smooth withdrawal, with minor discomfort instead of accute withdrawal symptoms.  I've used this method to get off kratom, oxycotin, dilauded, and various times in my life.  I didn't use these drugs recreationally mind you, I've had major surgeries and chronic pain, so when it was time to stop taking them I simply stopped taking them using this method.

The reason people become addicts who can't help themselves is more psychological than physical.  You're too afraid of discomfort, you have emotional issues you're hiding from by being high, typically low self esteem, guilt, depression, anxiety or other such issues.  This is why people become ""addicted"" to non addictive substances.  Deal with those issues and quitting drugs will be simple.

But after the second time I dug into the prescription monitoring program we had and back counted how early she was getting some of her fills in the past year. Just alone on early refills allowed by the pharmacy chain is 2 days per month x 12 months so ~ 1 month there. Then on top of it she would switch between morphine and oxcodone when she didn’t think they were working well enough for her anymore. So I flat out refused to fill it early the second time and told her I was only filling it on the day that she ran out.

634,2021-05-10 22:03:02+00:00," As [ilhas Seychelles](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/11/o-lugar-paradisiaco-que-tenta-acabar-com-uma-das-epidemias-de-heroina-mais-graves-do-mundo.shtml) impuseram novas restrições para conter a pandemia, apesar de serem o país com a maior taxa de vacinação em todo o mundo: 67,7% tomaram ao menos uma dose, e 61,1% estão plenamente imunizados.

 Um surto no final de abril, que elevou a incidência do vírus no país para números acima [dos da Índia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/05/covid-escancarou-estruturas-precarias-de-saude-e-saneamento-basico-da-india.shtml), coloca em dúvida a sua abertura ao turismo, bem como a eficácia da vacina da AstraZeneca, produzida na Índia, e a da empresa chinesa Sinopharm.

 “Apesar de todos os esforços excepcionais que estamos fazendo, a situação da Covid-19 no nosso país está crítica neste momento, com muitos casos diários relatados”, afirmou a ministra da Saúde, Peggy Vidot, na conferência de imprensa de terça-feira (4), quando foram anunciadas as novas medidas a que as 115 ilhas no Oceano Índico que formam o país estarão submetidas durante as próximas semanas.

 O arquipélago, que já tem 61% da sua população vacinada com duas doses, voltou a ser atacado por um surto de Covid-19 no final de abril, que fez o seu número de infecções duplicar num espaço de três dias, passando a registrar 1.068 casos ativos no dia 3 de Maio, segundo a Bloomberg. Em uma semana, o número dobrou de novo: nesta segunda (10), o país soma 2.486 pessoas em tratamento de Covid.

 Os cerca de 100 novos casos diários no país insular, com uma população de quase 100 mil habitantes, estão pressionando o sistema nacional de saúde local. Reagindo à situação, as autoridades impuseram o fechamento das escolas, apertaram as restrições de horários e proibiram todas as comemorações e atividades esportivas em grupo.

  A situação está sendo tomada como um sinal de alerta, sobretudo no que toca à eficácia das duas vacinas, que levaram as ilhas a estar no topo das campanhas de vacinação do mundo, estando prestes a ter 70% da sua população vacinada –e com isso a [esperada imunidade de grupo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2021/02/imunidade-de-rebanho-esta-longe-mesmo-com-avanco-das-vacinas-dizem-especialistas.shtml).

 Mas a subida de casos põe em dúvida “o alcance a que temos de chegar para obtermos a imunidade de grupo”, afirma Yanzhong Huang, um especialista em saúde pública e membro do Conselho de Relações Exteriores dos EUA. “É caso crítico para se considerar a eficácia de algumas vacinas”, acrescenta, citado pelo Washington Post.

 Cerca de 60% da população de Seychelles foi inoculada com a vacina da companhia chinesa Sinopharm, cujas doses foram doadas pelo seu aliado regional, os Emirados Árabes Unidos, ao passo que a restante parte tomou a vacina da AstraZeneca, produzida na Índia.

 Ambas as vacinas são [consideradas de menor eficácia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2021/04/vacinas-com-eficacia-de-95-nao-podem-ser-comparadas-as-de-50-veja-explicacao-em-video.shtml) quando comparadas à da Pfizer e da Moderna, que garantem uma proteção de cerca de 95%. A Organização Mundial da Saúde atribuiu recentemente à vacina da Sinopharm uma taxa de eficácia de 78% nos adultos, não tendo retirado conclusões para os mais idosos. Também na da AstraZeneca o valor ronda os 79%.

 O cenário nas Seychelles contrasta com o de outros países que têm campanhas de vacinação igualmente avançadas, [como o Reino Unido](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2021/05/abracos-estao-liberados-diz-boris-ao-anunciar-novo-relaxamento.shtml) ou Israel, e que têm visto as infecções por Covid-19 caírem bastante.

 Segundo escreve a Bloomberg, Daniel Lucey, um professor na escola de medicina da Darmouth College, em New Hampshire, refere mesmo que “há implicações globais para o que está acontecendo agora nas Seychelles, dada a utilização internacional generalizada destas duas vacinas”.

 Ainda assim, as autoridades das ilhas revelam que 65% dos novos casos são relativos a pessoas que tomara uma ou nenhuma das doses. A sua incidência de mortes também continua baixa, com 28 entre os mais de 6,000 casos registados ao todo.

 Na entrevista coletiva de terça-feira, o comissário da Saúde Pública do país, Jude Gedeon, disse que é incerto quanto tempo demorará até que a tendência das infecções se inverta, mas sublinha que “isso dependerá de como as novas medidas forem respeitadas”, disse, citado pela agência de notícias do país.

 Paralelamente à sua campanha de vacinação acelerada, as ilhas paradisíacas foram também um dos primeiros países a retomar a sua atividade turística, registrando um boom de turistas, especialmente desde o começo de maio. O cumprimento das novas medidas de restrição não está, assim, apenas nas mãos dos residentes.

 “Desde que reabrimos as nossas fronteiras no dia 25 de Março, chegaram cerca de 3.000 visitantes, através de diferentes companhias aéreas, num espaço de quatro dias”, disse à revista Der Spiegel a diretora-executiva do Conselho de Turismo do país, Sherin Frances.

 Os turistas não estão sujeitos a quarentenas à entrada do país nem são obrigados a estarem vacinados, tendo apenas de apresentar um teste PCR negativo realizado nas últimas 72 horas. “Acho que o fato de sermos um dos países com uma maior vacinação tem tido um papel-chave na retoma dos turistas, as pessoas vêem-nos como um país seguro”, afirmou à Spiegel um dono de um hotel na região, Robert Payet.

 Frances revela, contudo, que apenas 10% dos casos ativos de Covid-19 são de turistas. Isto pode derivar do fato de que uma grande parte dos visitantes vem de Israel –o segundo país com a maior campanha de vacinação, com também cerca de 60% da sua população vacinada. Contudo, admite que as vacinas são “muito eficazes na prevenção da doença grave e da morte, mas são menos boas na prevenção de infecções”.

 As Seychelles dependem fortemente do turismo, que geram 25% do seu PIB, tendo sofrido uma quebra de 13,5% na sua economia em 2020, de acordo com o Banco Mundial.",1

 O maior expoente é [“Cidade Invisível”, série da Netflix que põe cuca, curupira, saci e iara no centro de uma investigação policial](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2021/02/em-cidade-invisivel-marco-pigossi-encara-saci-perere-e-uma-cuca-bartender-no-rio.shtml). O projeto, o primeiro com atores de carne e osso de Carlos Saldanha, diretor das animações “A Era do Gelo” e “O Touro Ferdinando”, acompanha os passos de um fiscal ambiental, vivido por Marco Pigossi, depois que sua mulher morre de forma trágica num incêndio florestal.

 A produção, que estreou em fevereiro, ficou entre as mais assistidas da plataforma em 40 dos 190 países em que foi lançada, o que lhe garantiu renovação para uma segunda temporada, ainda sem data.

 No cinema, papa-figo e perna cabeluda, criaturas populares em Pernambuco, dão o tom à investigação sobre o desaparecimento de um rapaz em “Recife Assombrado”, em cartaz no Canal Brasil, outro que ganhará continuação.

 Já na literatura, romances infantis e juvenis, antes inspirados pela cultura europeia e americana, agora incorporam o folclore nacional. É o caso de [“A Arma Escarlate”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/livrariadafolha/1139788-editora-aposta-em-novos-talentos-na-bienal.shtml), de Renata Ventura, protagonizado por um garoto que se descobre bruxo ao receber, durante um tiroteio numa favela carioca, o pombo-correio de uma escola localizada dentro do Corcovado e habitada por criaturas como o saci-pererê.

  Lançado na Bienal do Livro de São Paulo há nove anos, o livro teve todos seus exemplares vendidos em poucas horas e já ganhou duas das cinco continuações planejadas.

 Ainda inspirada por “Harry Potter”, há a [trilogia “As Aventuras de Tibor Lobato”, de Gustavo Rosseb](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/livrariadafolha/2017/01/1815895-serie-teen-ambienta-personagens-do-folclore-nos-tempos-modernos.shtml), protagonizada por dois irmãos órfãos que se mudam para o sítio da avó e lá conhecem boitatá e saci.

 As semelhanças dos livros com a obra de Monteiro Lobato, aliás, não são coincidência. Foi ele, afinal, que [popularizou o folclore, motivado por um forte sentimento nacionalista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2021/02/acusado-de-racismo-lobato-transformou-o-saci-no-primeiro-heroi-negro-para-criancas-no-brasil.shtml).

 “Lobato era muito briguento. Ele implicava que numa praça houvesse anõezinhos, que não tinham nada do folclore brasileiro, em vez de sacis e curupiras”, diz Marisa Lajolo, uma das principais pesquisadoras da obra do autor, que leciona na Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie.

 Hoje, essa tendência é liderada por artistas jovens, que poucos anos atrás eram influenciados pelo mercado a escrever sobre o mesmo folclore estrangeiro, de “Harry Potter” e [“Percy Jackson”](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/folhinha/2014/09/1518619-confira-dica-para-decorar-o-nome-de-todos-os-personagens-de-percy-jackson.shtml?cmpid=menupe), os padrões de sucesso da época.

 É o caso de Carolina Munhóz, 32, e seu marido, Raphael Draccon, 39, que começaram a publicar no final dos anos 2000. Ela escrevia sobre fadas e leprechauns, e ele, sobre dragões, até Carlos Saldanha encomendar a trama que originou “Cidade Invisível”.

 “Somos da geração que precisou provar que escritores nacionais poderiam competir com estrangeiros. Quem nunca ouviu alguém dizer que não gosta de livros ou filmes brasileiros? O preconceito pode ainda existir, mas não é mais consenso. Por isso, artistas brasileiros estão mais livres e aptos a contar histórias com elementos nacionais”, diz Draccon.

 Ainda assim, o casal, que vive em Los Angeles, nos Estados Unidos, diz que há uma preocupação para que as histórias despertem um interesse no público que vá além da nostalgia. A estratégia, avaliam, é recorrer às origens sombrias das criaturas folclóricas.

 “O público, que já conhece o folclore brasileiro, fica surpreso quando o vê desconstruído. Sempre que se modifica algo conhecido, isso chama atenção”, diz Munhóz.

 As mudanças, porém, podem gerar conflitos, já que algumas criaturas têm origem em crenças indígenas consideradas divinas. Ao ser lançada, “Cidade Invisível”, por exemplo, foi posta no banco de réus ao lado de obras menos populares e até de clássicos como “Macunaíma”.

 “[Mário de Andrade deturpou crenças indígenas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2014/06/1475564-mito-indigena-conta-que-macunaima-nasceu-no-monte-roraima.shtml). O brasileiro se enxerga nele, mas o indígena vê sua crença na lama. É preciso ter responsabilidade com imagens que não lhe pertencem. Mas o que manda é o mercado. Não estão preocupados se alguém vai ficar chateado, ainda mais se for indígena. Falar de Maomé ou Jesus é terrível, mas de curupira não tem problema, ‘porque é lenda’, como se indígena não tivesse religião”, diz o [escritor Yaguarê Yamã](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/ilustrada/39657-projeto-conta-historia-indigena-em-idioma-falado-por-6-pessoas.shtml).

 O que para uns é uma tendência, para Yamã é a base de uma carreira. Aos 45 anos, 22 dos quais passou escrevendo, ele é autor de 30 livros, entre contos e romances infantis e adultos, além de dicionários e gramáticas, todos sobre seu povo, os maguarás, que vivem no Amazonas.

 Suas reflexões ecoam nas palavras do antropólogo João Pacheco, do Museu Nacional, da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, que estuda cultura brasileira e memória indígena. Ele frisa, porém, que a cultura “não é um conjunto de objetos em que se pode dizer o que é de fulano e o que é de sicrano”.

 “Eu não conseguiria traçar uma diferença radical entre o que é puramente indígena e o que é concebido por indígenas com a sociedade brasileira. Tentar separar é legítimo num contexto político, mas a cultura ultrapassa isso”, diz.

 Eles citam como exemplo o saci, indígena, que ganhou interpretações diferentes, sem interferência do mercado, ao se espalhar pelo Brasil cafeeiro, e a cuca, de origem espanhola e portuguesa, que virou um jacaré loiro e, com ou sem vacina, trabalha como bartender numa ocupação da Lapa em “Cidade Invisível”.

 Mesmo preocupado com a folclorização, Yamã diz acreditar que essas histórias podem desconstruir preconceitos contra indígenas.

 A chave, segundo ele, é ter o bom senso de não ser desrespeitoso nem apagar as origens das crenças e contratar indígenas para tornar as produções representativas.

 “O povo é muito ignorante sobre a própria cultura. O folclore passou muito tempo esquecido”, diz. “Ainda acham que o indígena vive nu, e essas histórias ajudam a conscientizar [que não é isso é verdade]. Falta ao brasileiro olhar para o espelho e ver o indígena dentro dele.""",1

649,2021-05-10 01:55:03+00:00,"Sadly trading one high tolerance st level with cause you to try to match on the new med (krstom in this case) but being unregulated (thankfully and unthankfully in terms of reliably potent and standardized doses and types) you would want that regular opioid dose tapered to where your going to start w/d and then find the dose to prevent that and then slowly taper the Kratom use down with half doses or as mentioned 1-2 day breaks until you can try to break to minimal krwtom.use before discontinuing that as the w/d.  Maybe some magnesium could.help as its good for pain and maybe the receptors ability to work or bind properly for opiate receptors but it's trading morphine or oxcycodone for illicit analogs as in the same receptors are being hit 4ven though different subunits with different t amounts and different affinities but the tapering has to begin to avoid the risk of w/d in the long term.

I feel for you as I'm prescribed meds that I couldn't walk to the bathroom in the morning without them cause spinal damage and congenital conditions. I'm not sure your full.story but if you were dependent or addicted to say morphine, hydro or oxy-codone or morphone than you can legitimately ask a pain specialist about BuTrans ( buprenorphine in a 3 or 7 patch that less risk abuse cause of being just partial mu agonist and also only fent or fentalogues can displace the high binding affinity for the mu receptors bupenorphone has.  With that said they also the same patches or chemical in subutex/subuxone but add the antagonists in case someone wanted to try shooting it the antagonists would block it while through the skin the antagonists isn't t needed as you wouldn't be able to really take the full patch at once. 

I'm only recommending to try this as a potential way to lower tolerance to both typical and atypical opioids(krstom) but if it helps prevent the krstom.w/d and you stop the bupe within a few days after stopping kratom you you might save yourself from significant w/d. They already give subutrx/subuxonr and for people w/ addiction to opioid and the patches for chronic moderate  pain &amp; they can choose different dose butrans patches of mcg/hr. And so idk if that dependency ir rehab/opioid replacement therapy is in your file or not.  If yes than asking for subuxone for a clinic isn't abnormal and BuTrans and other Rx versions is the goto for addiction-risk patients requiring REAL pain relief. This is a step under fentsnyl patches but would allow you to avoid w/d and lower krstom use. 

It would take discipline but once your first batch of subutex/subuxone/ butrwns is active you should recognize a major dip in the Kratom w/d and need.  I'd say use the minimal dose to just remove that or see if you can abstain completely as that would be best. If you can get past the kratom w/d time frame (1-2 weeks with the bupreborphine to help prevent w/d) with that said once you know thr w/d from Kratom is nearing completion or no longer required;  give it another day of just the bup-basws medicine and start taking partial dosages of the bupe-medicine or less than prescribed because even though it's less likely it can still.causw physical and psychological dependence if used long term consistently. You'll feel as you start skipping a dose or 2 with the buprenorphine levels are low but you take logs of responses without the bupe or time until any w/d  start and minimal dose to prevent. Ideally extending and lowering with each break in use to just prevent w/d. The half-life is decent so less redosing and longer times between doses allow the habitual aspect of needing x every so often. If this can be accomplished (substitute/avoid kratom w/d with bupe medicine), and find the point where the lowest bupe dose can prevent kratom w/d for x period of time. Slowly working that down to w/d not starting again allows you to taper off the shortly used bupe meds until you have minor or barely noticeable withdrawal at all. It's going to take discipline to not get high off krstom and the bupe meds or overuse them to see but with the partial agonist part their is a ceiling effect I believe. 

I.think that by using either rehab or pain based clinic with buprenorphine treatment (more accepted and safer than Methadone) you may be able to get a week or a month of the subutex/ subuxone. But they should prevent the w/d with hopefully substance your naive to internally. That will help overcome the original w/d bases on the w/d time from kratom and if done in less than a month could potentially lose the risk if w/d from.bupe or have them as minor as possible from a) short term use, b) using just to prevent w/d and not to standard or excessive dose at first until w/d starts to die, avoid ideas to use both or see ift you can get a buzz as rn the goal is to become less dependent and any dose buzzwords could push that back for time and make it harder. Keeping the tolerance to the bupe meds as low and minimally used as possible to just use for w/d effects should allow relief within a few days.  If you can get past the kratom physical w/d then you start self weaning off the bupe meds even faster than most doctors as you can recognize a w/d starting and subutex is sublingual and works within minutes and may even be cut into smaller doses potentially based on brand/manufacturer.  You may feel something from subutex as h and other opioid addicts observe some sensation but both the full agonist effects like morphine and typical pain medication. It looks bad now but sign the hippa form (if in us) not to share thus data intl your medical record lsnifnyou go for the rehab side but you could IMHO kick both the krstom.w/d and then the substitute meds I'm 2-4 weeks optimistically.  Bup3 binds stronger than other opioid except fent so it hangs on and in tapering you want as few doses as possible to break the mental cycle of drug.prep and use.  We all get that pre use feeling of excitement sp dropping that to a.minimal and no more kratom would be ideal. Plus now your doses are standardized so you can split them or cut them.and know exact dose needed to prevent w/d for x time.frame.  at one point you may say drop to every other day or every two..ifvyou.can get there than I'd say take a small partial last dose of.the bupe and give yourself 3 days and see how you feel. The potential short term dependency to the bupe will be easier to overcome than the kratom.w/d and you can do.this safely if done following this type of procedure to replace the agonist and taper the substitute down. Your self honesy with what's w/d vs craving also has to.be taken into effect as does behavioral pattern but if you can get partial doses or doses of subutex to prevent the kratom.w/d . Those krstom.w/d will dip away slowly and then let this new drug taper to nothing responsible any you may avoid w/d in general if the use of bupe/subutex/subuxone/BuTrans is limited to less than a month. Some ppl also vary and don't become.ohysically dependent to some meds after 1-2 month daily while other develop after weeks.  I feel this would be safest and most privacy saving method as you can specifically put on hippa form not to share any drg/alcohol rehab information or his info.  Idk if the krwtom story will be enough if the Dr are unfamiliar but claiming any opioid dependenceal at a rehab should get you on subutex/subuxone specifically cause your scared of w/d. That's one main reason they moved to that from methadone as methadone ends up increasing over time and bupe can get ppl dependent but it's not a full.agonist so less OD and side effect risk.and will wlso.hold the receptors and prevent h or morphine from binding due to increased affinity so they look at it as safety measure.

If you can substitute w/d off the first krstom and taper the subutex/ subu/butrans w/e within a month thebw/d if any may just be uncomfortable


The real issue is whether you were self medicating from original addiction to krwtom addiction and if so BuTrabs could be the pain relief without addiction you need.  If jt was just drug abuse then subutex/ subuxone would be first line treatment but if they're not testing for kratom you may need to dose yourself even minimal opioid bust to get that to show opioid use disorder and say you don't want methadone and want to try the newer treatments so you can come.off it. From.there it's discipline and even now.just minimal kratom to prevent ÷ w/d now and the doses should get lower if your pushing towards feeling w/d coming. The only thing you may want change is saying something analogous like heavy doses of oxy or hydro as you don't want them upping you to heroin or fentanyl doses of bupe but enough to prevent w/d as standard practice but some places test urine for the dependency claim so ppl don't randomly walk in and resell the subutex but in this case could help you a) quit opioid if possible(pain mgmt) and b) avoid kratom w/d via opioid rotation to a partial.agonist and then @gmail.com 7th 6th yonce you don't feel kratom craving ornw/d start coming off the bupe as you can still get hooked but over short period it can be used to overcome.one w/d until that's out and done and then taper off or CT the bupe to prevent any tolerance or decency on bupe before it develops.

If you came off hard real opioid addiction via kratom leverage that for subutex tonovercome w/d and stop subutex 2-4 days after no w/d symptoms and watch for any from the bupe but you should be OK if disciplined and I got faith you can do it.",1

The fact is that there is a long history of approved meds causing horrific problems. While the analogy is not exact consider that thalidomide was billed a perfectly safe antimorning sickness medicine for pregnant women, only to lead to awful birth defects. 

Or as another example of an approved drug, oxycotin, which has caused millions to become addicted and has now been pulled from the market in Canada because of the havoc it causes.

Just because something is approved does not mean it is safe.

No I’m talking about the perversion of the weed growing process to rationalize the legalization, regulation, and profit to justify the supply and demand whether for recreational or medical use. 

It happened there was a mention of conservative states pushing for medical marijuana and the argument that they care above making a profit or cut in this industry. Smoke another one if you think politicians care. It’s more about money, lobbying, and special interests.

Some growers use crap products or plant growth regulators (pgrs) to throw/spray in the fertilizer and manipulate the growth cycle. In general, weed can also be laced with other drugs like fetanyl, coke, heroin, etc as a means to get cash to make it faster, sell it quicker and create a dependency. 

With OP mentioning “thousands of strains,” that’s the very reason you should question what’s in your weed because it’s even easier to manipulate now versus the few strains that we’re available decades ago.  

The bigger the companies, the closer to special interests and $$$, then you’ve got more incentive to change up the product and not necessarily for the good. 

Yes this does happen. To say that every single weed product is pure is ignorant. Weed today for sale has contamination and has been cross-bred at some point. It’s what some will do to turn over quicker profits like lacing or manipulating the growth cycle that makes this “conservative state push” that much more alarming. 

Not every politician, grower or distributor is a bad actor, but when you’re dealing with mind and life altering products, you have to address the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Plain and simple.",1

Oil--Drugs--Sex. 

For example in Vietnam it was Sex (the ""exotic"" asian women) and Opium production in the golden triangle  (to Marseilles i.e. The French Connection but then the French were replaced by U.S.).

In Iran it was oil. We paid the Shah billions and he let us pump trillions in oil profits until he was deposed in Feb. 1979

In Afghanistan it was Opium. Afghanistan produces 82% of the world's opium. Consider that opium production was sky high (forgive the pun) until the Taliban took control of opium fields so that they could be destroyed in 2000. When Taliban lost control after 9/11 the opium came back until Taliban reappeared off and on. My thought is that since we produce heroin in pills now (Oxycotin) we don't need opium from Afghanistan any longer. 

Now both the Iranian and Afghan women being gorgeous (the video provides evidence of that beauty) was one reason the Caliphate wanted to cover that beauty up and make those ladies beholden to rigorous Islamic laws which favor and demand male domination.",-9

ich schaute in die scheibe gegenüber, und da war so ein wesen, von kopf bis fuß verbunden und sehr erschöpft wirkend, richtig abgefuckt. ich erkannte nicht, daß es mein spiegelbild war.


auf jeden fall spürte ich da so eine wesenheit hinter meiner schulter, die auch mich aufpasste, damit mir nichts passierte. nach einer weile wurde ich zu dieser wesenheit, und schwebte zur decke, und sah auf mich nieder. ich war von kopf bis fuß verbunden, und nur eine groteske geschwollene lippe schaute heraus. ich verband jedoch nicht mehr soviel mit dem wesen in dem bett.

In diesem moment wußte ich, daß wenn ich wollte, dann konnte ich jetzt ganz friedlich ins licht gehen, und alles wäre vorbei und ich hätte es hinter mir. ich mußte mich nur loslassen.

dummerweise wollte ich das jedoch nicht, da ich noch einiges zu erledigen hatte. und außerdem mag ich es zu kämpfen, die herausforderung. also ging ich wieder zurück in meinen Körper. und der nächste tag war wieder back to buisness und durchgangssyndrom. keine stressfreien friedlichen gefühle mehr wie kurz vorm sterben.

Lustig, wie sehr das Überleben vom Charakter des Patienten, von Launen, von Zufällen abhängt, nicht?


Besuch Nr 2:

Die Pfaffenbesuche sind mir richtig auf die Nerven gegangen. Ich konnte leider nicht Nein sagen, da ich ja Zeit hatte. Ebenso hat mich so eine Geistheilerin besucht, die mir am ende irgendwelche Fruchsäfte verkaufen wollte.

Ich weiß ich bin selber groß, aber ich wünschte, daß mich ab und zu jemand gefragt hätte, ob ich wirklich möchte, daß diese Pfeifen mich besuchen und so tun als würden sie irgendwas für mich tun, während ich sie in wahrheit einfach nur nicht vor den kopf stoßen will. Die haben mich hochgradig genervt mit ihrer aufgesetzten Sorge um meine Seele. Ich hab mich 1000 mal lieber mit der Pflege unterhalten. Ich weiß daß sie nicht viel von dem Tom hielten, dem Rettungssani (so ein kleiner bärtiger dicker mit vw Phaeton), der auf der Intensiv ausgeholfen hat.

aber er hat viel geschwatzt mit mir und ich glaub das war richtig gut für mich. Dickes Lob an Tom und Helga und die dicke nette Schwester, die versucht hat, mir den schlauch reinzuschieben.

Kälte:

Man darf nicht unterschätzen, wie saukalt ich es oft hatte. vor allem während des verbandswechsels, eigentlich wann immer ich ohne decke war. Ich hab richtig gefroren, ich kann mich an eine situation erinnern wo ich in einem Rettungsflugzeug versorgt wurde, und die Frachtluke war offen, und draußen war Schneesturm. Sie befestigten irgendwelche Sachen an mir, und mann, ich hab echt gefroren.

Heulen, weil ich in der scheiße liege:

einmal weinte ich, weil Niemand kam um mich sauber zu machen, nachdem ich ins bett gemacht hatte. Die schwester lüftete die laken, schaute nach, und meinte, da sei nichts. Ich war total verwirrt. Ich glaube, daß es schon vorgekommen ist, daß ich in meiner scheiße lag, aber halt eben nicht so oft wie mein gehirn das wahrnahm.

ebenso bildete ich mir ganz lange ein, daß mir mein linkes bein fehlen würde. Auch da sagte mir die schwester, daß ich beide beine hätte. ich verstand gar nichts mehr.

Frieren, weil man so viel schwitzt

Ich hab geschwitzt wie ein schwein. nachts war überall da, wo ich schwitzen konnte, das laken vollkommen nass. dann fror ich, weil das laken nass war. das wr allerdings die übergangszeit zur normalstation.

ich bekam die meisten medikamente, und wollte einfach nicht ruhig sein:

es stellt sich heraus, daß viele medikamente / schmerzmittel bei mir nicht wirken. ibuprofen, paracetamol, triptane, novaminsulfon, oxycodon, und noch ein paar andere. ich habe erhebliche schmerztoleranz gegenüber stumpfen schmerzen (spritzen und spitze schmerzen sind was anderes), aber dafür wirken viele medikamente bei mir nicht. Ich werd auch von kaffee nicht wach, gerade eben hab ich einen getrunken, und es ist fast 2 uhr nachts. ich glaube, ich bin non responder. anscheinend gibts sowas, aber das ist irgendwie kaum erforscht.

Fentanyl und Dipidolor sind das einzige, wo ich richtig was merke. Und ich weiß nicht, ob ich einfach nur high werde, weil, ganz ehrlich, schmerzen hab ich dann immer noch. Können sie sich an meine verbandswechsel erinnern, wo sie mir sagten, ich hätte doch schon dipidolor bekommen? ich warf ihnen vor, mir Placebos zu geben. man sagt, oxycodon wäre so wirksam, aber davon wurde ich einfach nur euphorisch, ich konnte trotzdem nicht schlafen und hatte schmerzen (bei einer Korrektur op im st georg leipzig).


naja puh, ich könnte ihnen soviel mehr erzählen. eigentlich wollte ich mich nur bei ihnen bedanken, weil ich das gefühl hatte, daß sie sich richtig um mich gekümmert haben (und wenn ich sie gerade verwechsele, dann gilt das trotzdem).


ich wollt ihnen auch berichten, daß es mir richtig gut geht - noch 13 Monate, dann wäre meine Ausbildung fertig (ich unterbreche aber, um mein trauma zu verarbeiten - von daher auch diese mail. ich fühl mich ok damit.)

Letztes jahr hat mich jemand um zelten überredet, und ich war kanufahren, hab in der hängematte übernachtet, und ich war so verdammt häppi, das können sie sich gar nicht vorstellen. dieses jahr habe ich selber campingplatz reserviert, ich freue mich total.

die zeit auf der intensivstation war sehr schlimm, aber sie haben mir geholfen das alles zu bewältigen.

komischerweise möchte ich die zeit nicht für eine million euro eintauschen, weil sie hat mich zu dem gemacht was ich bin, und ich mag mich trotz allem irgendwie. ich kann mir garnicht mehr vorstellen, normale Haut zu haben. Nur die ALT lappen, das war eine Scheißidee.


Bitte grüßen sie mir alle die mich noch kennen, und die die Hand über mich gehalten haben und beschützt haben. ich war sehr gerne auf der intensivstation und habe mich richtig behütet und umsorgt gefühlt. ich hatte zeit, über mich nachzudenken, und konnte Abstand von meinem manipulativen Eltern gewinnen.


ok das wars,


mfg und danke für das was sie tun,",13

Furthermore you would have to prove he was regularly using the same levels of fentnyl frequently 2 months prior to his death. Honestly the most obvious explanation is that Floyd tried either swallowing and/or dropping all the drugs he had on him at the time which of course can lead to overdose. And there is even evidence of that along with video showing white stuff in the back of his mouth.

I stayed up all night All I did was black out and have rage/panic attacks/cry a bunch and kept falling down. I thought my BFs heart was going to stop and he had been a longtime xan addict and was experienced with opiates. Someone so experienced that he was cocky and since he’s made it out okay previously, already had a couple of beers before chewing the whole goddang bar. He’s had the ish being pressed down in south austin and assumed it was the same— even after i told him about what my friend went thru just taking half. It was like she was on a motor but also kept nodding off/collapsing. Ive seen plenty of people on various drugs before and the behavior she was exhibiting was some next level stuff. Im assuming my friend is in the same situation as I am when it comes to having such an adverse reaction to anti psychotics, but for others who react normally, will definitely be KOed or dead :c one of the reasons why I know these bars weren’t cut with fetanyl is that I already take gabapentin so I really should have not had the reaction I did if those xans were laced with fet.

697,2021-05-07 16:55:24+00:00,"I’m not saying they are idiots.  in the case of alcoholism I am saying they were handed a culture that doesn’t work for them or their health.   When it comes to the opiate epidemic they were handed a pill to make the pain go away instead of being told by the medical system that, yes it will hurt but it will get better.  

Even twenty years after ocycontin was identified as highly addictive we still have a massive opioid epidemic.  Breaking your leg hurts.  Healing a broken leg hurts.  Giving people opiates keeps doctors and nurses from having to provide care and support - and saddles a good number of people with addictions afterwards.  And if uncle Jim or aunt Susan has a hookup for pills the next thing you know you are a junky.  

Idiots? No.  Creatures of habit and convenience?  Yes.  I pity the poor because nothing they even see, even at church these days, teaches them how to lift their head out of the muck and when someone does? Their own “culture” teaches them to drive it away and call it immoral.",-9

I started to notice a lump on my right side of my neck and I didn't think about it, later down the track so I went to the doctor had  2 ultrasounds and he said don't worry about it it's nothing and anyway it kept growing for months i went back for a second opinion (Different clinic) the doc sent me to the hospital because he knew it wasn't normal. 

Near the end of last year November / December I started to see a specialist and I had 2 biospy done, 4 little pieces out for the first time and second time had to go deeper due to my neck is 2mm thick 7x7cm this was in the morning before I had my work Christmas party . I am on medication as well methotrexate prednsilone and ointment.

Ai u mor peng nga Sulltan Murati dhe luftoi për Perandorinë Otomane si gjeneral deri më 1443, vit në të cilin u largua gjatë një beteje, duke u rikthyer në Krujë.

Në vitin 1444, mblodhi të gjithë princërit shqiptarë në Lidhjen e Lezhës, ku u vendos unanimisht të luftohej për marrjen në zotërim të trojeve shqiptare kundër Perandorisë Otomane.

Në krye të ushtrisë shqiptare, pas fitores së parë kundër otomanëve në betejën e Torviollit, Skënderbeu do të korrte 22 fitore të mëdha kundër osmanëve në vitet e luftës në krye të ushtrisë së vet, që kishte si kryeqendër Krujën.

Heroi kombëtar do të njihej për luftën e tij të paepur në një vend kyç mes lindjes dhe perëndimit. Ai do të njihej si besnik i mbretit të Napolit në traktatin e Gaetës, ku mbështeti mbretin Ferdinand të Napolit në luftën civile të viteve 1460–1461.

Në vitin 1463 ishte komandant i forcave të kryqëzatës së Papa Piut II, ndërsa vdiq më 17 janar 1468, në moshën 63-vjeçare.

Gjergj Kastriot-Skënderbeu konsiderohet nga shumë vende të Evropës Perëndimore si heroi që pengoi Perandorinë Otomane të pushtonte Perëndimin e Evropës dhe si modeli i rezistencës së krishterë ndaj otomanëve.",5

Also for the future, it’s alright to show/post your score but never ask if it’s real or fake. If somethings suspect bout your pills we will warn you, I‘d HIGHLY SUGGEST you get yourself fent test strips for the future pick ups, if you are not sure if it’s real or not.

748,2021-05-05 11:04:56+00:00,"Hello friends! Today is my daughter's birthday. She is 12 years old and I really can't believe it. Her birthday is so very special and meaningful, because her coming into this world saved my life. 

You've heard me share how I had been clean since 2009 before, well that was due to the birth of my daughter. I am so very grateful that I did not do permanent damage to her, as she was directly impacted by my opioid addiction during my pregnancy. I used while I was pregnant, and she suffered from withdrawal when she was born. I'm so very thankful that she has not suffered any long term effects as a result of my choices. She is beautiful and smart beyond my wildest dreams.

I carried so much guilt, shame, and pain with me about this for a long time, because I could not stop using, even knowing that I was growing a life inside me. The disease of addiction is so fucking powerful. I hate, accept, and respect the power of it.

Thanks to my daughter, I was able to get clean when she was five months old. I was finally able to accept what I had done and become honest about it for the first time with anyone ever when I worked my 5th step with my first sponsor in 2010. I then started weaving my story into my leads and heard the countless other women who had made the same choices. We cried together. We never wanted to make these decisions and impose this condition on our unborn children of our own volition. But we did. And we had to accept it. We did so together. It was cathartic.

The early-mid 2000s in the US were riddled with opiate prescriptions, which then led to herioin use by millions of people. It was an epidemic that did not reach its height until 2017. Now it's back in the form of heroin-laced fentanyl, and it's killing people en masse. Every single day I think of the women who are in the same position that I was in 12 years ago, and children who are impacted by this medical condition that is a disease of the brain. I have become an advocate to support pregnant women with an opiate use disorder to seek a doctors help to use pharmocotherapy during their pregnancy (subutex, methadone) to stop illicit drug use, because the outcomes are much greater for children who are born to women with this condition under the medical treatment of a physician.

My radical acceptance is that while I experienced all of these things and imposed my condition on my unborn child, I STILL picked up a drink in 2018 because I fooled myself into thinking that I was cured. That I could drinknin moderation. Whatever bullshit rationale I built. I accept that I am not now, nor will I ever, be cured from this condition of substance use disorder. Instead, I must continually treat the condition with brutal honesty to myself and others, acceptance, gratitude, patience, and a whole lot of love and forgiveness for myself and those around me. Each and every single day. I accept that I cannot let my guard down. If I do, it's a matter of life or death. Today, I choose life. IWNDWYT ❤",10

 Sem ser nenhum 007, sei que não devo entrar nessa cumbuca. Você clica e por algum mistério o seu sistema de busca padrão na internet passa a ser automaticamente o Bing.

 Dá trabalho voltar para o velho e bom Google. Mas... ah-ha, eu tenho meus segredinhos.

 Meu navegador preferido é o Chrome —sigo a maioria, sem dúvida—, mas digo para o computador que meu navegador-padrão é o Microsoft Edge.

 Desse modo (espero), todas chatices e padronizações involuntárias são canalizadas para o Edge, que nunca uso.

  Claro que, no fundo, essas supostas espertezas são tão risíveis quanto a atitude de um aborígene enfrentando com arco e flecha uma ogiva nuclear.

 Em matéria de conflito real, leio que a [Apple entrou em guerra com o Facebook](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2021/04/novas-regras-de-privacidade-do-iphone-prejudicam-facebook.shtml), lançando um sistema que teoricamente protege a privacidade dos usuários. Para cada aplicativo que você baixa no celular, há um modo de impedir que rastreiem seus dados pessoais.

 Não acredito muito no sucesso da iniciativa. É possível que, para a maioria das pessoas (eu, pelo menos), essa questão de privacidade não seja tão sacrossanta assim.

 Gosto quando se baseiam nas minhas escolhas quando me indicam livros e filmes na Amazon ou na [Netflix](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2021/04/no-streaming-algoritmos-se-tornam-curadores-e-pautam-producao-cultural-online.shtml).

 E me divirto quando, sabendo da minha idade, a internet me oferece as melhores ofertas para aparelhos de surdez e higienização de dentaduras.

 Já a manipulação política é um caso bem mais sério; linchamentos virtuais também.

 Acredito que reprimir esse tipo de coisa é uma tarefa urgente, que passa por cima das desculpas habituais em defesa da liberdade de expressão ou da velha e boa privacidade dos usuários.

 Depois de Trump, da Covid e de violências de todos os tipos contra figuras públicas, vai ficando consensual o sentimento de que a liberdade de expressão tem de ter limites na internet. Como sempre teve, aliás, em qualquer meio de comunicação pública.

 Não se trata do fascistinha comum ou do comediante vulgar. Um estudo do governo britânico chegou à conclusão, nestes dias, que Vladimir Putin dispõe de uma rede de trolagem destinada a inibir as críticas da imprensa internacional ao regime.

 As páginas de comentário online de vários jornais, em 15 países do mundo, são invadidas por mensagens a favor das atitudes da Rússia em questões estratégicas.

 O governo de Putin depois republica tudo na mídia local, para mostrar que conta com apoio no estrangeiro.

 Não acho que isso seja teoria da conspiração; o papel dos russos na eleição de Trump é conhecido. O fato de muitos malucos acreditarem em todo tipo de conspiração não impede que conspirações existam de fato —ainda mais quando os malucos assumem o poder.

 O faroeste neoliberal da economia foi transposto para a internet, outra terra sem lei.

 A vantagem cresce, sempre, para quem concentra mais poder: tanto os grandes conglomerados econômicos, quanto os ditadores. É o Estado, o Estado democrático de Direito, que serve para proteger as vítimas dessa situação.

 A direita, ao mesmo tempo que faz vista grossa para o autoritarismo político, adora ver em todo Estado o carrasco das liberdades individuais.

 É uma lorota; não há liberdade individual sem Estado democrático, sem os freios e contrapesos estabelecidos na lei e na Constituição.

 Nada mais patético do que os [manifestantes ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2021/05/com-pai-nosso-e-ave-maria-protesto-de-apoio-a-bolsonaro-autoriza-o-presidente-a-promover-atos-anti-democraticos.shtml)[pró-Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2021/05/com-pai-nosso-e-ave-maria-protesto-de-apoio-a-bolsonaro-autoriza-o-presidente-a-promover-atos-anti-democraticos.shtml), querendo um golpe para garantir os “direitos constitucionais” de não usar máscara, lotar hospitais e contaminar o resto da população.

 Nesse modo de ver o mundo, o poder absoluto de Bolsonaro se transfere a cada um de seus apoiadores.

 Cada um se imagina um bolsonarozinho, de arma em punho, podendo xingar negros e homossexuais à vontade, sem nenhuma limitação legal.

 O chamado “cidadão de bem” adere, desse modo, à utopia do bandido, do traficante que ele tanto detesta. Com uma pistola na cintura, fará o que bem entender.

763,2021-05-04 17:21:29+00:00,"Doctors did play a part in the opioid crisis, but there's a few more things that went on.

The doctors didn't set the prescription guidelines for opioids. Physicians rely on the data and standards set by the FDA/drug companies/etc to know how to prescribe things. Purdue funded studies saying that Oxycotin wasn't addictive and incentivized hospital administrators and government regulators to treat pain as the ""fifth vital sign."" With the Purdue study saying that opioids were nonaddictive, they seemed like a good choice. Should doctors have been more proactive in realizing that their patients were becoming to the painkillers? Probably. However, we're in a for-profit medical system where Medicare reimbursement to hospital is partially based on patient surveys, which includes wether the patient felt their pain was adequately treated.

That doesn't excuse some of the doctors who became pill mills, but there were a lot of different players and I think the blame should mostly fall on the pharmaceutical companies (and the system that let them get away with publishing studies saying opioids aren't addictive).",7

I support a wall, but I also support a massive overhaul of the system so that we can process immigrants *legally and quickly* so they become tax paying citizens. I support the police and back the blue, but I also want them stripped of the military gear, forced to go to school for 2+ years of training, only hired in the communities they serve, and be subject to personal lawsuits for transgressions (accountability). I support transrights, but not for sports (there is a happy middle, where we have a third category of records) and not for kids. I think Geroge Floyd died of Fetanyl and was a career criminal, no loss to society, but be still didn't deserve a knee on his neck and was done wrong by the police. I think BLM is a great idea, but the corporation growing around it is a scam pushing an intentionally divisive message (as the co-founder said: ""we are trained Marxists""). I watched the media make ""AllLivesMatter"" into a race thing, when it was actually being promoted on the right to mean ""both sides are being abused by the police"". 

When the media &amp; 450 of the Fortune companies back your ""movement"", it's anything but counterculture. ""Systemic racism"", cried the people in charge of the system. Like Joe, who wrote the 3 strikes crime law that put many of us in prison for life (including an uncle of mine, over weed). 

I think the media is the enemy of the people, both sides are controlled by the same entities conspiring to increase an artificial divide. Actually, I don't think this. I know this to be a fact. The enemy is a handful of people led by Klaus Schwab, architect of the Great Reset. 

My favorite part is that 80% of people believe the news when they say it's a conspiracy, [despite them talking about it openly](https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/).

I was doing so much better of MScontin and Endocet even though it was high dosage) I honestly just fight to stay alive every day but lost the fight to win and live I think. I think I just yearn for the same release you do. We're both sexy too. And good, antagonistic people like House who used to inspire me and I totally watched his show too. I don't want to die but I can't live either.

 I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I feel my life my whole life is over all ready and I lost all my dreams to be someone who made a difference or mattered in the world. I'm a ghost of my self. And the best has already long pasted me and the worse is yet to come.

Suggestions---

This disease invokes many questions. Type them all out and bring them to the appointments. This way, she won't forget to ask and a copy can be given to the doctor for his/her own patient record. It helps organize and track what's going down. 

I notice a lot of people come to this sub asking if they have CREST / Scleroderma / Morphea etc based on a million things. While I think it helps to connect with the community, I wouldn't treat it as medical advice because it may mislead.

The part that no one tells you about is the couple days after recovery until both your dressing and stent is removed (day 5 and 6). Everything hurts to do except laying down.

It's gonna be a painful couple of days. Don't be afraid to ask for pain medication from the nurses (they are annoyingly reluctant to give you oxycotin and give you tramadol instead which didn't work on me at all)

With Covid, the mason is very lonely as you will be alone in your room most of the day, but you can still talk to others in their rooms if you can move (I wished I talked more to the others).

The wifi there is complete garbage and wasn't working for more than half the day so make sure you have a good amount of data lol.

I have honestly found the hardest part is those couple of days before everything is removed. You will be impressed at how quickly you recover considering the extent of the surgery, once the dressing and stent are removed you can easily walk, bend over, lay on your side and stand up straight which would all be impossible or very painful just days before.

Has a central line we used to do heparin locks but now we lock the line with .5 ml of 70% ethanol. It used to be that you had to pull it back out of the line afterwards into a syringe, but our care team is one of the top in the country and when I was trained on the ethanol locks I was told they have since realized it’s safe to flush it into her and we don’t have to pull it back out. My daughter is like 15 lbs and has stage 3 liver fibrosis, which happened way before ethanol locks. I feel like it’s hard for me to believe that flushing this .5 ml of very concentrated ethanol into her bloodstream once a day can possibly be good or safe for her at all, especially with preexisting liver damage; but I trust her team because they are well known for being exceptional. Same baby was addicted to fetanyl in hospital after needing it for pain management in NICU and she hadn’t even reached her due date yet. She had to be put on morphine to wean because she was going through withdrawals when they tried to stop. Really want to minimize the additional damage we do to her developing brain, just seems crazy that the daily dose of IV ethanol no matter how small, will have no effect",2

This is the current state of policing in america. 

The belvidere illinois police ignore all constitutional rights, they preform no knock, no warrant raids, they pull people over and strip their cars and leave them a mess when they dont find anythjng, they throw away peoples lives and treat my beautiful hometown lile an active warzone. The entire town is oppressed, on probation or in jail and paying rediculous fines. The poor community has a police department with all new dodge challe ger police cars and you cant leave the house without seeing multiple people pulled over. 
This is not an exageration. Any attempts to file greviances are intercepted and thrown out. The jail denies people medical care amd is crawling with mrsa and other inhumane problems.

Recently i saw an article that said civil forfeiture &gt;theft crimes?! Is this true? The cops sieze more money from people than all theft crimes combined?

Straight fascism. A successful country doesnt need babysitters if they cultivate virtue within their society. 
What was my crime? Trying to medicate to ease my mental health issues caused by legally prescribed painkillers?!

My entire family thinks im a junky loser thats made a life time of bad decisions when in reality ive owned up to my mistakes and been striving to make my life better to no avail. Im a ghost. They might as well have killed me. Im not allowed to leave the country, i can't join the military, no one will hire me despite my educational attainment and competency...

Up until real recently private prisons owned by judges were a thing, are you serious!?

This country operates as a police state to the world, it only makes sense that we would do that to our own people. Prison does nothing to rehabilitate or address the causes of crime, it fans the flames as a business model and makes political pris9ners of people who weren't fortunate enough to be born middle or upper-class white people. 

Robert sapolsky from stanford mentioned a study that shows judges hand out harsher and harsher sentences as their blood sugar gets lower and lower. 

Monkeys policing monkeys. 

The phrase ""monopoly on violence "" sums things up well.

What happened to the slackler family that invented fentnyl and lobbied to ease regulations around incentivising doctors to prescribe pain killers by buying them cars? They became billionaires. Are we homdingbthose people accountable for domestic terrorism? No. They killed more americans than any war. Yet they are billionaires. This country deserves every bit of the collapse happening. Someone tell me why we deserve to be the ones leading the world and making executive decisions. Its disgusting.

No matter what, ill always be a compassionate person and help others. I wont stoop to their limbic system monkey aggression level reasoning ans behavior. Ill be a force of good to the world and help others. 

But ive lost all feelings of patriotism and pride in this country. Im disgusted with so much. 

To make things worse my family can't relate to or understand any of this. They tell me to take accountability for my actions ( i did clearly, i paid my debt to society 10 times over). They think its 1995 and that i can just go get a job capable of paying my bills and having a family. Even if i didn't constantly get rejected for jobs on the basis of my background, i would have to compete with the huge chunk of unemployed people in the job market. Im in my early 30s and going through the second once in a lifetime recession in my adult life. 

My plan is to hitchhike to texas and apply at tesla and finish my mechanical engineering degree at the university of texas austin. Hopefully when i finish i can get hired despite my background.

821,2021-05-03 01:16:17+00:00,"People don’t really know how to respond to chronic pain unless they have experienced it. That’s why I no longer discuss mine.

Try 25 years with this crap...I’ve learned a lot of things along the way and I’ll tell you one thing there’s little one can say to such suffering. The best thing would be if people would just listen and ask what they might be able to do to help you like do some chores, help clean your house.

People talk like they know what they’re talking about when in fact they pretty much know nothing. Hey I think most pain doctors don’t even know what they’re talking about except stuff they read in a book. It’s not like they had to experience a month of number ten pain to have an inkling of what they discuss with many of us.

People don’t know and/or are very uncomfortable with subjects like suicide, death, disease and more.

When I had cancer people gave me so much unsolicited advice it was hilarious. It washed hillarious at the time. I just looked at them with this seriously stupid face to get them to stop talking. Once we accept that people just do this it’s a little bit easier.

It got so bad with me...people were pretty much telling me to put a pineapple on my head and run quickly in a small circle and make SURE that was a counter clockwise circle. They didn’t have any interest in that I am a strictly western medicine gal.

I’m older and more tired now. I don’t discuss my pain anymore. Most people except a few if we’re lucky just don’t want to hear about it. 

I almost lost everyone in my life I got so angry. I then withdrew from the world for a long time. I did what I needed to. I did what I had to...surviving has often been my best effort.

It’s been so long now that those who truly couldn’t handle it have gone. Thank god. Those who stuck with me know there’s nothing they can really say but just a few I’m sorry’s for which I’m truly grateful for. 

I can say that I believe we don’t know the future. After the first 15 years I finally got my fusion most of the worst of my nerve pain got much better. Of course I wound up getting sciatica from scar tissue. More pain. Then tried a Quell machine. It was unbelievable. I was almost off pain meds after decades of oxycontin, Morphene, diladiud, fentanyl and more.

Then I developed an allergy to the electrodes I had to use. That was seriously depressing but I never truly get my hopes up so I won’t get too disappointed.

Then three years ago I tried Lyrica. More magic. That is until it stopped working. 

Having a few good breaks along my 25 years on this journey really really helped. Gave me an idea of how amazing life can be without pain. 

Some might say they would milk themselves if they had to go through this for that long. I tried that too but for whatever reason I have tried to get through things because I guess those brief periods of being pain free really brought some hope.

With a lot of time I don’t listen to the idiots who try to say stuff to me who obviously know nothing. If I need to I will simply ask how long they had their pain and make them feel kinda stupid. It’s easier somehow now. Time has made me tired and less upset. I am very very very careful about who I hand out with. For the others who I still have to keep in contact with...well after so long they finally know there isn’t anything they can really say but they’re sorry I have to deal with this.

It’s hard to be understanding and sweet while you’re in excruciating pain. I’m way better off by being my own best friend. Most people don’t really care about our pain. They just want to get away as fast and as far away as they can. I don’t blame them now. I just take that as a fact that it’s a human limitation. Be it good, bad, fair, unfair whatever that may be.

I don’t expect people to be good. I think we all know there are all kinds out there and we limit ourselves to assholes. I limit myself to people who are idiots and people who don’t get chronic pain. They simply don’t know any better. They are uneducated so I just try to educate them a little bit but first I ask them if they truly understand my injury and ask what is it about the fact I’m stuck like this that makes them so uncomfortable.

I hang on to my friends now like dear life. I get how difficult it is for them even knowing they will never understand what I’m going through. They don’t have to get it. They just have to try to not fix me or make stupid comments.

I don’t believe I’ll be this way forever. I don’t know what the future holds. I’m not giving up hope although it’s likely I’ll suffer with this. It’s going to go whatever way it goes and there’s much I can’t control.

I can control my expectations in most situations. It causes me too much grief to expect someone to get it when I now know better. They are not bad people they just get on my nerves so I walk or run away. They just don’t know. They will probably never know. It’s up to us to tell them what we really need and to tell them why what they are saying truly doesn’t help us. If nothing more maybe they can learn to stop doing this.

We have to be completely direct with everyone concerned. We simply can’t expect them to get it. Also some want to be completely left alone while others don’t.

My best friend has chronic pain. It was an accident that I met her but it’s a great thing to have...someone who gets it.

Ok I’ve gone on for a long time here but like life as we get older some really bad shit happens to most of us. Rarely few get out of this world without some horrible heaping of pain.

What works for me is now surrounding myself with people who get it or show potential of getting it. I keep a small circle of friends. I prefer to keep my world kinda small because it works. When someone now tries to give me advice I ask them what they really know about my condition. And last but not least, I don’t expect them to get it right off the bat and I’m completely honest with telling them what I need regardless of what it is. 

Most people don’t want to wash my floors but many have offered to stick with me through this horrendous journey. It’s not easy hanging out with people you can’t do stuff with. It’s not easy knowing you can’t really help. It’s not easy being with someone who is often in a foul mood and so on and so on. And I know it’s harder being us but life is unfair and we can’t blame people who have it better than us. If we do we are destined to a life of misery.

This from someone who’s been around the block, been around the world and then some.

Ask for exactly what you need. Take what you want and leave the rest.",3

I'm on methadone and knowing what I know now makes me wish I could go back and just kick the sheets for a few days (about a week) and be done with it. Methadone takes months to get put of your system. It gets stored in your fatty tissue and even after you've ""quit"" methadone I've been told that every once in a while those fatty tissues will release a bit or after exercising or strenuous work you'll experience withdrawals, albeit slight but full withdrawal symptoms nonetheless. They only last like 5 or 10 mins but it's enough for the thought to cross your mind about scoring dope. I wish I never would've started methadone. I've been on it for 10 years and am tapering slowly from a rather high dose (225). I just started tapering a few months back and am at 175 now and haven't rely experienced any withdrawals except for a few restless nights. I use edibles every now and then to help with that and it seems to work fine. I've started tapering so slowly because I work 8 to 12 hour shifts in construction in the Phoenix area so the summer time sweats it out of me by that evening. So I've reserved myself to just knowing that the winter months are the ones I can taper on. Summers coming on (we're already at 98°) so ill probably taper once or twice a month instead of every week.

My brother died in 2017 from the same thing. He was a heroin user, not necessarily an addict. He had a fulltime job, his own house, paid all his bills etc. He didn't spend his days nodding out  or missing family or anything. We never even knew he used until he died. The sad part is he didn't use more than he normally did, the batch he got was just mixed with fentynal and was way too strong. The ME said he was dead before it was all in his veins. 

It just makes me really sad to see this keep happening to people. Decriminalization is not enough. We need education, therapy and safe use sites with clinically administered drugs.  People are going to use these drugs regardless, the best thing we can do is regulate then safely. 

You can overdose on alcohol so the whole argument of ""Why should we sell legal drugs that can kill in abundance"" is pretty moot. People that want to use drugs will, if they have a place to get clean, clinical drugs there is way less room for overdoses when used moderately like most people do.

so the idea of safe injection sites are basically, let them use it so they can safely wane themselves off of heroin and can contribute to society again. That is making sure they dont kill themselves ODing on it

Another thing that chimes with this topic is the phrase ""misery loves company"" and my god is that ever the most accurate thing when it comes to drug use. The way almost anyone gets dragged in is from a friend who most likely had a shity hand at life and started drugs at an early age and is looking for company in doing so. I would say that's how not people started with heavy drugs. 

I somehow survived fentnyl while my friends didn't. People who managed to quit but were easily convinced to come back because I just wanted sombody to do drugs with. Every addict is guilty of this and it's a toxic environment to say the least. Only way to win is to not play. 

If your reading this don't ever fucking try crack or opioids. There is no chemicals besides those that will make you give everything for. Both your health, money and most importantly your soul. Some might say cocaine and maybe they had worse experience but crack is just something else but they can be considered close enough to the same shit.

no.1 The 3rd directly says ""We lived through the harshest era, the height of All for Ones prosperity."" and the 3rd was also shadowed but here he directly says we(in this context Yoichi, the 2nd and Himself) the whole fucking point this theory got created was because two shadowed users appeared in the fucking background(the 3rd was heavily postulated to be Kirishima)

no.2 what the fuck would be the point of not revealing being from the future, hell thats information Deku could use and the whole fucking point of this fucking conversation is to fucking get him to cooperate with the Deku the SUCCESSOR.

no.3 The 2nd refers to him as ""that boy"" Bakugo would logically at an older age know not only of OfA not only of All for One but also USJ arc, Sports Festival arc, Final Exams, Forest Camp, Provisional, Joint Training, Endeavor Internship, War Arc, multiple AM talks in general, which would also include AM's talk about the history of OfA, multiple quirks, why wouldn't the 1st already be told of the future so he could plan accordingly etc

no.4 In what world does Bakugo's character regress and condescend so far he calls Deku(you know the one current Bakugo is trying atone for his treatment of and approaching him as an equal and rival) as merely a boy, ""that boy"" in particular in no world where Horikoshi isn't on crack fetanyl is that Bakugo, that's just some old head resistance tough guy leader.

no.5 the Second has done very unheroic shit. ""extinguished many lives"" particularly comes to mind, also in what world does Bakugo look at anorexic kid locked in a fucking room and even thinks about shooting his ass ""cuz he a opp/he da enemy"" that's so unheroic even Chapter 1 Bakugo isn't remotely comparable.

no.6 if Bakugo time traveled he would have technology impossibly advanced(the compression tech gauntlets) and a quirk extremely abnormally powerful for the first generation(when the average quirk was much weaker) some guy off the street with no record no nothing suddenly appearing and being this ridiculously powerful missile of a soldier would draw eyes(unless you suggest Bakugo held back to seem gen appropriate)

no.7 All for One killed the 2nd and 3rd he would have had to see them use there quirks(unless Bakugo for some crackhead reason decided to fight quirk less cuz yolo right(maybe he wanted to die because of how unnecessarily edgy and shitty his writing had gotten by that point))

no.8 Eri is not time travel, she simply reverses the state of a body no amount of trigger or quirk awakenings can turn that shit into time travel(and if your theory involves Eri getting put on trigger and a quirk awakening to achieve this psuedo time travel I need to ask for evidence in the fucking story this will happen).

no.9 this would create a time loop(enough said)

no.10 Occam's Razor rather than having this crackhead theory relying on quirk awakenings, time travel, time loops, and Bakugo getting turned into this unempathetic tough guy(who dyed his hair for some reason) who's willing to kill for victory(even captives).HE'S INSTEAD

I remember like 10 or so years ago there was a recall of fentanol for whatever reason. I think that company sold it to drug cartels who then used it to cut heroin and then realized how amazing it was for profits and then started to look for more and China was more than happy to supply. It's just speculation, but I've lost all of my closest friends to friends to fentanol overdoses. And it wasn't like this 10 years ago - fentanol wasn't in everything. I'm pretty sure a friend overdosed from buying fake pulls cut with fentanol on the street. It's ridiculous.",1
861,2021-04-30 22:40:59+00:00,"Disclaimer, this is only from my experience, working with a small amount of breeds. Also, pretty much every farm is different and will do different things.

Cows are very hiarchical, so they fight over who becomes ""top bitch"". Related to that, the vast majority of cows actually naturally grow horns, they don't have them because the area where they grow is burned using a hot iron to prevent growth. Sometimes farmers do a shoddy job and you'll see a cow with like 1 little nub sticking out.
The reason why the horns are burned off is actually because they are hiarchical, having 1200 pound cows slamming their horns into each other isn't good for their safety, it also makes it much more dangerous for farmers as cows now have a good way to express any negative feelings towards a farmer.

Cows NEED routine, like to a ridicolous degree, during changes in time (going an hour forward or back), they will lose their shit. Changing wake up times (cows are milked shortly after waking up) will have a negative impact on their milk production for weeks. Some farmers get around this by changing the wake up times 5 min every week leading up to the 1 hour jump forward or back.
The reason cows are not grassfed nearly as much is because of the low amount of energy available in grass, a dairy cow might be able to produce 30-40 liters of milk per day on grains, with grass it's closer to 20-25 liters. If a cow is not milked for a while they will start experiencing severe pain due to the pressure the milk is exerting on the udder. Imagine only being able to pee if someone helped you, and if you were not helped it would just accumulate more and more. 


When milking a cow you inspect the teats, and wipe them with a soap and water rag, then you milk it by hand (just a spray or two) to make sure there's clearance, some teats can become clogged or unuseable due to scarring. After this you attach the milking machine. Sometimes that's not enough to get the milk to flow, so you need to massage the teats to simulate a calf, worst case scenario, the cow can be injected with oxycotin, which is the bonding chemical also released by humans.
The release of oxycotin is also what makes a human female ""dispense"" milk. Cows are usually milked 3 times a day, VERY early morning (like 4 am), midday or early afternoon, and then evening. Due to it being spread out so much, many farmers work a staggered schedule, so they might work from 4am until 10 am, then have a break from 10am until 3pm, and then work again until 6pm.

 There are of course variations on this. 
There's also a lot of automation happening, cows will naturally wake up, and with a chip implanted into them (like their neck or ear), or hung on a necklace, they will go to a milking machine which will open up if it's time for them to get milked. Then they'll walk in, the machine will do its job, and they walk out having been freshly milked. This obviously saves a lot of time compared to having to herd them individually.
There are also difference in milk production and fat content, holsteins are typically higher milk volume producers but lower fat content (maybe 1-2%), whereas cows like Jersys have a significantly lower milk production, but a much higher fat content (4-6%).


Cows are also very curious creatures, though also easily frightened due to being a prey animals. One of the exceptions is when they are in heat, cows will fuck pretty much anyone and anything when in heat. To the point that they will literally run after humans and when they get close they'll rub their head on you on moo similarly to what they do to bulls. 

Also, cow tipping is a myth, they sleep laying down. They are also excellent cuddlers, and love getting scrathed.",7

Aber für deine Probleme ist es ungeeignet.
Erstens die verf**** hohe sucht Gefahr weil es einfach fast genau so eine Wirkung wie herkömmliche Opiate/Opioide wie oxycodon, hydromorphon etc. hat.

Energie gibt es dir im Endeffekt egal welche Sorte aber White soll aktiv machen und zb Red Sedieren, außerdem ist es halt auch gut gegen Schmerzen.. also  exakt genauso wie die opis die du im KH bekommst wenn du zb einen bruch hast.
Also du merkst es ist nicht dazu gedacht das so oft zu nehmen wobei noch zu erwähnen ist dass so ca. 80% der Leute in (Thailand war's Glaub ich?) Danach Süchtig sind.. die nehmen das Zeug wie Kaffee am morgen weil die solange arbeiten und es halt wie gesagt die schmerzen vom langen Arbeitstag nimmt, Euphorie gibt, wach macht, der Tag super schnell vergeht, es dich entspannt und vieles mehr.
am Ende haste also ne Sucht und einen sehr sehr unangenehmen Entzug vor dir. 

Übrigens der Geschmack ist REUDIG 
Du mischt meistens so 2-4g in einen Kaffe und es schmeckt wie eine Mischung aus Rasen und Matsch
Klar, du kannst es auch in Kapseln zu dir nehmen.. aber viel Spaß dabei 15 Stück zu schlucken..
Bitte schau nach anderen alternativen und nicht nach opiaten/opioiden
Kratom ist 12-17 Mal potenter als Morphin..
Bitte nimm das nicht.. viele reden das so gut aber im Endeffekt ist es als würdest du stinknormale Pillen fressen wie oxycodon oder sonst was..
Bitte kommt mir nicht mit es ist doch bloß eine Pflanze Blabla.. ja es mag sein dass es vielleicht gar nicht so ungesund ist aber es bleibt ein ""opiat"" mit den selben Nebenwirkungen, Langzeitwirkungen und alles was dazu kommt.",3
