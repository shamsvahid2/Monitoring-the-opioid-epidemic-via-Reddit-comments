After a couple matches I invited everyone over to my house for a BBQ and some drinks. Everything was going well turned out to be a great time. My brother brought his new gf at the time. He's trying to show her how tough he is by showing her his mma skills he learned. So him being my little brother I have to show him up of course. So I get him in an arm bar. I guess I tweaked in a little to much and I hear him let out a little yelp. So I say I'm sorry and go to walk back to the rest of the group until I get tackled from behind and I put my arms out to catch myself and hear a loud crack. Thought I landed on a stick until I tried to push myself up and my left wrist touched my elbow. Turns out I snapped both bones in my forearm. No pain at first since the shock set in. So I lay on the ground with everyone huddled around. They call the ambulance. It comes within about 5 min and they load me up, put a vest on me with some velcro in the middle and say they are gonna shoot me up with some fentenyl before the set my arm by bending my arm over my ribcage to get my wrist in what turned out to be a wrist strap in the center of my vest. Last thing I remember is yelling stop stop stop before i assume I passed out. Turns out when you're in you 20s they don't do casts anymore.

No, it just shows that you're okay with targeting based on race.

Being armed doesn't make your death justified. I carry a deadly weapon (pocket knife) with me everywhere for utility. In a country as rural as America, being armed shouldn't be a death sentence.

Breonna Taylor was shot to death in her bed and her husband thrown in jail because he tried to defend his home from a break in, both of them had spotless records.

#*Pressed pill inquiries are not permitted under any circumstances.*

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

41,2020-06-28 09:32:49+00:00,"I’m not an EMT, I’m a social worker specializing with individuals with some pretty severe behavioral problems. I end up calling 911 at work fairly often for some pretty extreme injurious behaviors and I’ve never seen an EMT administer anything stronger than ativan. That being said I’m not going to pretend like benzos aren’t a huge flippin problem too. 

If ketamine is a good alternative I am totally on board with using it on a large scale to cut back on some of the more addicting meds. I grew up in the area the HBO documentary Heroin: Cape Cod USA was filmed and that shit is too real. Out of my graduating class of 450 I think it’s around 20 people who have died and a lot more who have had their lives ruined because some doctor somewhere realized they could get cool kick backs from pharmaceutical companies if they prescribed Percocet for a sore throat (that’s my example because I was prescribed perocet 10/325 for a sore throat when I was 15. I’m very lucky downers don’t do it for me)

My problem with this situation is that I doubt that these EMTs had any real extensive training on what they were giving or why they were giving it. They were instructed by one of the other first responders to give him Ketamine and they gave him what seems like a pretty high dose (500mg) for “excited delirium,” a diagnosis not recognized by the APA, AMA, or WHO. It seems to only be recognized as a medical phenomena by police officers who have killed someone for no real reason. He wasn’t displaying any behavior worthy of any sort of restraint, chemical or physical. He was a kid on the spectrum who had done nothing wrong and didn’t understand the situation, he was trying to politely ask them to respect his boundaries the entire time they were murdering him. The fact that the first responder even ordered this medication, that up until pretty recently in the US was broadly known as an animal tranquilizer or a way to get high, to me seems like they saw him as nothing more than a dangerous black man who needed to be put down. 

I’m sorry for the vent I totally know that you are not being argumentative at all and I hope you see I’m not either. There are just few things in this world that get me as heated as social inequities or the evil that is big pharma.",1

44,2020-06-28 04:10:53+00:00,"Well now, lets look closer.

79-89, Heroin production begins with likely CIA backing of the Mujaheddin 'freedom fighters' against the Russians. This was exported to the west for big profits and tuned into guns to fight the Russians. Ten years of growing and selling makes for a country with some expert poppy growers with international sales contacts.

Then 89-94 after the Russians withdrew in the power vacuum a host of Warlords fight for power, that fight is funded by Heroin production and international sales.

Then in the early nineties, the Taliban rose to power and for 5 more years THEY ran the heroin making bumper crops and record cash to fund THEIR war.

In 1994 the Talban rise to power. For 6 more years they run the heroin trade and they sell record amounts. This money is channeled into early childhood education and national infrastructure.  
Nahh just kidding the Taliban use heroin money to fight THIER war against the west.

Then in mid 2000 the Taliban leader declared Heroin 'Un-Islamic' and poppy production drops by about 75%. This reduction holds for about 2 years, and in that time heroin traced back to Afghanistan still flows into the west . It is speculated that during this time the Taliban made even more cash as they were driving up the price by ending farming on the one hand, while selling from a massive stockpile of heroin with a long shelf life. These assumptions are based on being able to forensically test heroin to trace its origins and the fact that during this time the Taliban show no signs of a cash flow shortage.

 Also during this time Hamid Karzi is yet to be President, he calls the Taliban Brothers.

 By a strange Coincidence Hamids actual Brother strongly believed to be a CIA Asset and also involved in the heroin wars is at this time.

in 2004 Hamid takes the Presidency, almost immediately he rejects international proposals to end the heroin trade because it would have negative economic effects on his country.

So the last 16 years of the trade can be summed up as business as usual. Every now and then a US presidents and once even the Russian president (no longer a system that can be realistically suing the plural of president) has sent strongly worded letters saying to stop. Piece meal military operations hamstrung by local governance and national government make token efforts to fight the poppy trade.

 Meanwhile various Heroin backed war lords with ties the the Heroi-stocracy graduate to become Heroin backed elected politicians.",1

I think the reason people keep doing it is that it makes bad days feel good. Even if it was raining and everything is just shit, you'd still feel good. And when people keep taking it continually, the body builds up a tolerance. Withdrawal doesn't happen after trying it once, and that's probably also what fucks people. They keep on taking it because they didn't feel like there was anything bad about, and before they know it, shit hits the fan. And then when they don't get their fix, they really start to feel bad. And at that point it really becomes a fix. Now they don't feel the high as much, but the lows get worse and worse. Now they are just taking it to not feel the withdrawals.",1

Na China, a classe politicamente dominante são os proletários, e as perspectivas ideológicas estão presentes numa compilação de discursos de Xi Jinping, ""A Governança na China"". É transparente, e você pode dizer se há uma só contradição entre a prática dos comunistas e sua teoria.

Eu entendo perfeitamente a censura, e a hipervigilância. Muitos desses relatos são exagerados, mas eu compreendo tranquilamente o motivo para isso. A China é alvo de ataques imperialistas, e você nem precisa ler muito para saber, o anticomunismo anti-China se encarna na figura de Trump. A CIA, um aparato do Estado burguês dos EUA, promove propaganda baseada em manipulação e mentira para os países da Ásia, pelo seu canal ""Radio Free Asia"". Hollywood é também uma máquina de propaganda, e filmes de criança ou de super-heroi são cheios de ideologia burguesa. Existe uma ligação da CIA com Hollywood muito antiga.

Diante de tanto ataque de propaganda, é importante que o povo chinês tenha total controle do conteúdo que entra e sai do país. Eles não permitem o tipo de filme de violência gratuita do ocidente, por exemplo, e os critérios do Partido são filosóficos (até porque os membros do Partido necessariamente precisam de estudo em filosofia, história e educação política para exercer cargos políticos).

Por exemplo, Hong Kong eles não controlam a distribuição de recursos e de informações, por isso há tanto movimento liberal por lá, que é apoiado pelos EUA, Reino Unido e outras nações imperialistas. É visível a necessidade da censura.",1

I quit for a year or so and picked it back up just as a social habit. But not long after it became daily.

I used it for years recreationally, until I stopped again and I developed a hernia after the first month, I figured I'd give it a try to reduce inflammation and the hernia subsided. This might be coincidence but I haven't had it come back in almost 10 years since it retreated back. 

I continue use but mostly as a night cap, afterwork wind-down. 

Recreational use is dangerous and can leave you feeling a bit worthless, unmotivated and sometimes irritable. But moderate use can be somewhat beneficial, not during working hours or sunup to sundown. 

I have seen the damages that prescription drugs do over time, family with chronic pain. And I would be advocating against things like oxyconton, morphine, even Tylenol, etc...

a lot of people say they're referring to XTC, which is a good possibility, BUT they mention a lot of pharmaceuticals, along with street drugs, but say the street drugs cant compare to these pills, and no matter who you are those are all strong pills. and most of D12 was addicted to these drugs. Bizzarre, and Eminem are two of the biggest ones, Bizarre loves every and all drugs, same with eminem, but he was famous for taking downers in his later years and even became addicted to ambien, along with valium,xanax,somas,hydrocodone,and oxycodone, in the APAP forms too might i mention and he would take 20-40 pills a day.

But the thing with opiates if you have to be careful. 
You’re lucky you’re at the stage where you hadn’t taken any and got to experience your first high(s) from the hydros. 

Most new people don’t start with 30mg of hydro though more like 10-15mg lol. You did 30mg without feeling sick, dang that’s cool man. I remember my hydrocodon days. 

You just have to be careful because the withdrawal from those things and/or other opiates is terrible. You basically haven’t been sick until you’ve experienced an opiate withdrawal. It sucks. 

This happens when you take them everyday for an extended period of time, maybe a little less.(everyday use). Your body/brain gets used to them and no longer produces the stuff that your body needs to feel good and comfortable on its own and it starts depending on the hydro. 

so when you stop taking it, you get really sick for like 6-7 days. I hope you never experience withdrawals man. 

Just try to enjoy them sometimes here &amp; there. Try not to get into the habit of taking them everyday.

- heroin

How many of these people do you think even knows what an abolitionist is?

People like you who do this give them cover and the pretense of reasonableness, when it is not reasonable what they are doing. Trying to create change by attacking white people and burning down building. Destroying statues, and calling for death of a race.  How are you so blind to this hypocrisy?

If you think it's okay to murder, burn, destroy lives, destroy monuments and history to create change for a notion that doesn't even have validity I don't know what to say except you should reevaluate your ethics and think more. Don't just accept what you're told. People try to influence you. 

The stats don't bear out their assertions of 'racism' nor ""systematic racism"", nor does it bear out when you look anecdotally at examples **they** hold up. Each of their ""hero's"" killed by cops was a degenerate scumbag who's hurt people in a major way, spent their lives taking from others, robbing others, fathering kids and abandoning them. So many are in the actual middle of a crime when they get themselves killed.  

You know this dude who died overdosed on fentanyl right??? Is it more convenient to omit that from your mind? **Lethal overdose levels of fentanyl**. Likely swallowed his bag when the cops showed up in response to him trying to use counterfeit money at the same store twice in a day!! wtf is going on. After he resisted arrest they likely restrained him further away with the knee because they suspected exactly that. They didn't want the incredibly potent fentany being exhaled on them. It can be lethal, and will absolutely dose you if say -he coughs it in your direction also not to mention he had corona virus (As a seperate issue, I wonder if the police were notified he was positive for the virus before this, may have caught them maintaining a secret database).  **Screencap this, I'm not kidding - when this gets to a court of law with evidence and not emotion -those are going to be the reasons the cops held him like they did.**

87,2020-06-25 21:12:51+00:00,"The health effects of certain drugs (most classic psychedelics) are negligible.

Some drugs, like cocaine, Adderall, oxy, etc. won't cause permanent health damage from infrequent use, but they can be dangerous as they increase the risk of complications. Stimulants increase risk of heart attack, stroke, etc whereas opioids and other downers have a risk of overdose, which is where the drug depresses your respiration enough that you aren't getting enough oxygen. That being said, occasional use of these drugs assuming they aren't laced and you are being responsible is unlikely to cause any significant damage to your health.

Some drugs, like meth, pcp, krokodil (dimorphine), and a lot of inhalants really can cause serious damage to your health, even if you only use them occasionally. Meth and PCP can both cause brain damage and psychosis, krokodil causes necrosis so bad your skin melts off (not an exaggeration), and inhalants can cause oxygen deprivation in the brain and organs. These types of drugs are also the most addictive, usually, although some people claim benzodiazepines (Xanax etc) are worse due to the withdrawal period.

All in all, not all drugs are really dangerous unless you abuse the shit out of them. The odds of ruining your health with most drugs is very low assuming you don't become addicted.",4

94,2020-06-25 16:18:51+00:00,"&gt;Ајде да оставимо по страни етичко питање да ли је то убиство или не, шта ако отац жели то дете? Да ли он нема никаква права на своје потомство? У том случају он се може и водити принципом да је његово дете убијено.

 Zato što se fetus nalazi u telu majke a ne oca. Ne možeš nekog da prisiliš da izgura trudnoću i porođaj ako to jednostavno neće. Poenta je da ne smatram fetus za samostalni organizam odvojen od majke. Dakle, neko ima prava da radi sa svojim telom šta hoće i asolutno niko drugi čak ni otac deteta nema prava da nekom određuje šta neko da radi sa svojim telom.  

&gt;Исто као питање горе, где је отац у таквој ситуацији? Уколико се он не пита, а рецимо био је за опцију да се прекине трудноћа, док жена одлучи задржи дете, да ли отац мора да плаћа алиментацију за то дете? Или жена мора бити приморана да абортира јер отац не жели?

Ovde se zalažem za ""legalni abortus"". Znači da muškarac ima prava da ako žena ne želi abortus da se odrekne svih obaveza kao otac. Mislim da to postoji u nekim zemljama. A sa tim da bude primorana žena da abortira opet se svodi na to da niko ne može nikom da određuje šta da radi sa svojim telom. A sam abortus i nije toliko bezbedna procedura. 

&gt;Хмм, људи и даље пију и седају за волан чиме угрожавају свој живот и живот других у саобраћајум е а ти би још ствари да легализујеш. Морамо схватити да су људи неодговорни у овом друштву. Па наш народ неће смеће да баци у канту. Тамо где престаје разум и где не постоји појам о личној одговорности и свести о колективу мора да ради закон.

Ali ako nekog tipa uhvatih da vozi pod dejstvom heroina, dobije doživotnu zabranu vožnje auta i to je to. To što je štetno opet kažem, protiv sam nanny state, Dok god ugrožavaš samo sebe ok je.

Anyway no I am not interested in the individual data sheets because they aren’t the source I requested, nor do I think the conclusions you’ve drawn from them are natural or logical. I disagree completely that that is enough proof. Just because something has fewer ingredients does not inherently mean it is a cheaper option. I also do not see where you’ve considered the storage of the medication; packaging and shipping; the equipment required to pump it (the programs on the computer, the tubing, the pumps themselves); the extra bottles and extra labels; and the staff to do it. Just because you may save money in one area - and I’m not convinced that’s the case - doesn’t mean you aren’t losing money as a direct result somewhere else.

I’m not sure how ocycontin is related to this discussion at all, I could care less what the executives had to say about it. We all know they fucked the goose regarding OxyContin, it’s not a secret. Is that supposed to be about corporate greed? Apparently I’m missing the point.

Furthermore, even if the liquid formulation WAS cheaper to provide - and I remain unconvinced that it is - so what? It’s their prerogative to choose a cheaper formulation. In fact, I’m all for them saving money in one area, as perhaps that will result in funding in other areas or the ability to take on more patients. You seem to have this mentality that everything that’s for profit is a bad thing. I fundamentally disagree. We’d have significantly less treatment available in this country if for profit centers weren’t allowed to operate. That means significantly fewer people would have access to treatment. So I do not support that. If you wanna blame someone, don’t blame the for profit centers. Write your state rep, your congressman, vote for candidates who share your positions, etc. but there isn’t enough government funding to go around and that isn’t the fault of for profit treatment centers.",1

113,2020-06-24 19:15:00+00:00," Hi there,

just signed up to report back my experience with this novel RC opioid. A little background info regarding tolerance: I'm a daily Kratom user (\~20gpd, almost 1 year) and have quite a high natural tolerance to opioids. For example, when I’m not on Kratom and have no tolerance, I still need at least about 30-40 mg of Oxycodon for a decent high. Recently I consumed 2-methyl-ap-237 (2-map) about every 2-3 Weeks, always between 1-2 g for a couple of days. My usual dosage with 2-map is about 120 mg rectally, +-40 mg, depending on the effect I wish to achieve.

So I figured, after doing an allergy test,  that 50 mg plugged should be a reasonable starting dose (**for me!**). I redosed 25 mg 30 Minutes in, so all in all I took 75 mg via my golden hole ;). I try to compare the effects I got with 2-map effects. The powder dissolved easily in 2ml water, which then turned milky – cloudy. Feels way softer (less caustic?) in the butt after injection.

The comeup was a little bit slower for me, kind of a more steady, gradual comeup, less of a rush. Definitely less sedating and more stimulating overall. Regarding Euphoria, 2-map feels more euphoric than ap-238 by first impression. I was a little bit underwhelmed of the strength of the high. I would say its definitely more functional l and I don’t agree, that it has more of a high than 2-map.

I can’t really say something about the duration of effects (because of adding 2-methyl-ap-237 about 5 hours later), but it seems to be in the same range as 2-map. With 2-map, I feel the “rush euphoric high” for roundabout 30-60 minutes and after that I have a stoning opiate buzz for several hours. Ap-238 - just like the comeup – seems to be more gradual, more balanced in it’s “time /// strength of effect – curve. Therefor the craving and urge to redose seems to be much less pronounced with this new compound. 

After the second dose I felt kinda “off” for like 10-20 minutes and my body felt – hard to describe – somehow edgy – not in a pleasurable way. This feeling faded after a while and left me with the described - relatively week - opiate buzz.

All in all, I’m quite disappointed and underwhelmed. Bear in mind that this experience is highly subjective and only based on one trial, I’ll report back, if further experiments change my estimation of this substance. 

So far I would stick to 2-map in the future. I can’t really say something about potency after one (underwhelming) trial, but for me, 150 mg 2-map feels waaaaaay stronger than this 75 mg ap-238 experience (both plugged). **Maybe plugging just doesn’t work as well with ap-238, is this possible?** Strangely i had almost no miosis and no itchiness (which is a cons for me, i love itching on opiates).

Cheers,

124,2020-06-24 05:43:44+00:00,"Now imagine this... What if I wanted it more for mental health reasons? Isn't that sensible? 

If we assume I'm sincere in my thinking, we could say I find therapy meaningless and I could mostly say anything a therapist could say to me. There are things in my life that could improve my life, like finding a relationship, but I seem to be so absolutely horrible at that for the last decade(32/m) that it feels practically like torture to even approach girls anymore. Can't force someone to date me, and whining like an incel is a waste of time.

First point being, I'm depressed and no one can live my life for me. No one can hold my hand through anything, because, in most ways, I simply refuse to adapt or change.

Perhaps more sensibly, I've also lived with hemophilia all my life. My joints are pretty fucked, and most physical exertion results in pain. That's not to say I'm *always* in pain, though, but I have endless experiences with horrible pain from internal bleeding in my past, and now I've got medicine that sort of prevents that from recurring, but my joints are still fucked up.

So, second point being, I have a condition that's physically limited me and *can* cause me pain a lot of the time, particularly if I'm active. Meaning, for one thing, being depressingly sedentary is how I avoid pain. I'm also on disability, so since I'm settled on living a meager and jobless existence, what else could I care to do?

I had a couple occasions since maybe 2014 where I experienced opiates at the hospital. My kidney was clogged with blood clots in 2014, and they finally gave me morphine when I said I wanted to jump out the window. Then when I responded that I still sort of felt pain, they gave me dilaudid. In mid 2019, I broke a bunch of ribs and punctured a lung, and I ended up getting fetanyl and eventually a dilaudid drip and dilaudid injections.

I know opiates aren't anti-depressants, but anti-depressants can fuck off for how much they do anything for me. I'm afraid of doing anything illegal and risking my life with something that could be tainted, so why the hell shouldn't I be able to have an opiate prescription? I've been drinking myself to death over the last couple years. If I felt comfortable, I wouldn't even need any of that bullshit. 

Plus, I'm getting more and more worried that I *will* needlessly take the illegal route. Sure wish I could, like, get some fucking heroin, take it to my doctor, then be like, ""See, I'm risking my life. Just give me a safe prescription.""

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

A razão pela qual eles cortaram relação com o seu passado tem a ver com a nomenclatura.

Em Portugal ou na França não dizemos que temos origens italianas, Dizemos que temos origens latinas ou romanas.

O Brasil não se vê a continuação dos império Português e não tem o Cabral e o Vasco da Gama como seu heroi precisamente por causa da nomenclatura.

A Lusitânia, ou como se dizia antes, a metrópole, está a morrer afogada e agarrou-se ao nome Portugal à medida que vai para o fundo.

Devíamos ter mudado o nome em 1974, O Portugal que começou em 1139 (ou 1128 dependendo de como classificas) morreu no 25 de Abril quando decidiu abdicar de um papel decisivo na política internacional.

You can debate where the line falls between what should be over the counter or not, but that isn't the point. 

Having drugs be legally obtainable helps assure they are regulated and makes it harder for black markets to thrive (morphine in a labeled vial vs street heroin) Look at the darknet, which is a very popular way to obtain drugs. Its an entire marketplace with vendors, reviews, etc. We need the legal version. I actually buy my weed from a reputable online dealer, legally, instead of having to sit at some sketchy guys house that I don't want anything to do with, waiting for a bag. And of course, legal drugs are subject to taxes. 

Ironically, having drugs legalized actually doesn't change the rate of use much, if anything it falls. Our own country has this data from when weed became legal. The people who want to try are going to regardless.

Also, its easier to get a variety of different illegal substances today than at any other time in history. Why fund a losing battle? 

You and I have the same goal at the end of the day, but you're way to get there is simply wrong. It's been tried, it does not work.

 I saw a comment you made earlier saying something like ""weve tried being nice and treating addicts/dealers with dignity""

Do you really believe that? Every single social service related has been slashed or private funded. Aids saskatoon can't even get funding for an injection site. You agree thats a good idea.

I have the same thoughts.

If we're talking full rework, the [Lich Rework Webgame](https://kaian-a-coel.github.io/Kuva-Lich-Rework/) is as good as it gets.

For the parazon thing, Liches are still susceptible to physical injury. Continuity kicks in only to prevent/avoid death. In the aforementioned webgame, you have small battles with the Lich as you do in the game now, When their influence is down to one node, you have a Requiem Attempt battle, that kills them no matter what, and if you get it wrong, they return the next day. 

The general system proposed by the webgame is ideal, and the Lich Rework I'd push for and be extremely happy with.

However, the small change I've mentioned here is all I'd ask for from DE - As a proper Lich rework is sadly unlikely.

Lore-wise, Requiem mods are not explained at all, so it's entirely up to speculation. I like what you're presenting, though.",1

""Lynching"" has a connotation of a crowd hoisting up a person because they don't like the fact that this person is black. Often the excuse for a lynching is one of the public enforcing decency laws, regardless of whether the evidence was there or the punishment appropriate.

And here we have a crowd... hoisting up a person because they don't like fact that this person is/was a cop. On the excuse of enforcing decency laws, regardless of whether the evidence was there. 

I, along with most people here, are (I'll put it like this) sincerely disappointed by the lack of integrity demonstrated by the law enforcement community nationwide over our lifetime. In agreement with the general point the BLM movement makes: we expect better. But selecting a target because of their affiliation is not ""better"".

My post was spurned by the comment ""Either way, this dude should rot"" referring to a person whose charges seem... unsupported. Its got that whiff of the police who shut down a bakery for having 20lbs of fentnyl. Several days/weeks later, the lab got their hands on the white powder in question... and it turned out to be flour. ""This dude should rot"" indeed. 

That said, I will admit that doing it metaphorically in an online environment is better.",1
146,2020-06-23 14:35:26+00:00,"I bought my first gun two months ago from a local pawnshop.  I filled out a piece of paper, confirmed my address, and signed that I was not mentally ill enough to have a gun.

Up until I really started having real, honest conversations with the conservation association I worked for and thinking about the global impact of gun control on rural populations I have always stayed far away from guns.

When I was a kid I grew up in a place with drive-by shootings and one time my Dad almost accidentally shot me while I was playing outside in the bushes.  I was always afraid it would be something that could be used against me.

BUT all around the world nature preserves, state and national parks, and people who hunt for subsistence need guns to help manage their work.  They are TOOLS.  And for the poorest people in the WORLD guns are how you eat.  They aren't out shooting 20 deer or decimating an endangered population, they are balancing out the face we have no apex predators really left in the west, and taking home 1-3 deer a year to freeze. 

No one needs an AK-47 or something crazy that only the military uses to shoot a deer or even defend their home from a small group of invaders.  Handguns and a pump-action shotgun will take care of that amply.

However, the imaginative vision is someday a truck of hippies is going to come up, take away everyone's guns, make everyone gay, and drive off to the next town.  Or that the 18% of Black people in the USA is going to drive up, do ""gangster stuff"", and drive off to the next town.  And that isn't going to happen.

Our greatest threat in Oklahoma is ourselves and the criminal element that not race-based, but cartel, gang, and mostly motivated by drug addiction.  You can't shoot Oxycotin or Meth to make it go away, but you can incarcerate shoot the people who are addicted vs trying to spend money on comprehensive rehab.  AND these people can do like I just did - drive to the gun store, fill out a piece of paper, and grab a gun - and that means military-grade semi-automatic guns.   However, it was just as easy before - you just didn't fill out the piece of paper and no one knew you bought a gun.

So I ask - why were there no mass shootings in Greenwood or at the BOK this weekend?  Why did no one really show up to cause problems?  Why did the National Guard fall asleep they were so bored at the protest?  Why was there a march to the state capitol by Black gun owners with NO INCIDENT on Sunday?

Because everyone has access to firearms here and you know if you start something, you better be willing to bet your life on the persons you are fighting with aren't going to pull a gun on you and or all their posse will and or will your friends back you up? 

It keeps a fragile peace.",1

150,2020-06-23 08:43:13+00:00,"I got this substance that was sold under the name of diphenpipenol from kinda well-known vendor that is also well-known from having overpriced substances but also as one of the first who introduced rc nitazenes to clearnet rc market (if you still dont know which vendor I mean, I can maybe add they like to call themselves grateful, but I dunno what they are grateful for, lmao).
It was total waste of money, completely inactive and really was like my first encounter with substance also mislabeled as W-18 few years ago that in the end appeared to be actually MT-45 - however this situation happened with another, local vendor that was back then also selling U-47700 and some fentanalog that wasnt yet illegal in Poland back then.
The true diphenpipenol seems to be really decent and promising drug. I totally agree with mr-hunter when he says that future of rc-opio market is in morphone/morphinian family of substances, not necessarily and strictly morphine derivatives but meperidine analogues (there are dozen of possible pethidine analogues that are decent in potency, not caustic/toxic and also got recreational value, like 4-fluoro-pethidine for example) - I am currently collecting money to be able to prepare proper lab with all necessary glass and equipment as well as safety/emergency supplies but the real problem is finding a place to create such lab in Poland (where I live) coz it would require access to running watter, electricity, good ventilation and also be rather isolated from regular appartments where normal people live - lab within best spot I had a pleasure to see was placed in small village, in freely standing home suited for single family with nearest neighbor living 3km from it. This was by the way the main source of butyrfentanyl and fentanyl synthesized in Poland in 2013-2014; for a fact I know they created there also other fentas and tried nitazenes syntheses (but in that time I was out of the game already, getting back on track with my health after detox and being in 12-month lasting rehab facility). 
Anyway, when (or if) I finally manage to set up proper lab I gonna try to synth some potentially new and decent opioids and semisynthetic opiates (there is really easy method of getting oxymorphone from oxycodone - which I got access to in theoretically unlimited supply in from of pharmaceutics as Oxycontin and Xancodal - but for now I got problems with converting salt of it to free base, as this route to oxymorphone requires oxycodone freebase and all pharmaceutics are in form of salt, usually oxy hcl. So if anyone knows how properly base it (also would be nice to hear some ideas about best extraction process from pills, that doesn't come with much impurities), I am all ears and eager to talk about it (feel free to contact me, best if we could talk via SureSpot or Wickr, but mails work fine as well as long as you use tutanota or protonmail - otherwise mail me only with use of privnote)",1

I started having heart palpitations and went to the er. All was good... my pee started getting darker and I was just not feeling well so I got some blood work done and my liver enzymes were high. I do not drink or take pain killers and I eat very well. Anyway, after that I started researching online and come to find out that there are accounts of cardiomyopathy and liver disease in long term users. So I decided to stop. I tapered down but the withdrawals were really bad. I am a cancer survivor and was in the hospital for a month about 2 years ago and was on a morphein drip for a month, so I know what opiate withdrawal feels like... anyway, it felt like that. Just like that... it was crazy. I’m glad I’m off it but it took me about 4 months to feel normal again.

162,2020-06-22 18:31:25+00:00,"Thats a good venting story, Its good to read. Anyways first off I want to tell you that you can get clean again, you just need to really want it. I know how bad wds and PAWS can be. I am now using since 5 years, I directly started one day after my dad killed himself and I found him (I got PTSD from that, also I am bipolar and got a major depression since I am 16) I sttarted with codeine my doc presxribed me, I got a script for 1L of codeine, no prometh or anything else in it, I got 1L every 2 weeks for a month also I got a script for 100x2,5mg Lorazepam a month for about a half year because of my qnxiety attacks I had. After 2 month of codeine my lungs got back to normal and I got a script for 100x100mg tramadol and 100x200/16mg Tilidin/Nqloxon for about 5 more month, I also took all my dads left over Tramadol 200mg and Tilidin/Naloxon 200/16mg, I took 600mg tramadol and 800-1000mg Tilidin daily for 5 month then my doc wanted to taper me down and he did it in 1 month but I still took the leftover pills and still took 400mg tramadol and 600mg tilidin daily. After my doc cut me off I started buying Methadon and Oxycodon for ca. 1 month, in my country isnt really a pill game so I had to pay 20-30€ for a blister (10 pills) 60mg Methadon and 30-50€ for a pack (4 blister) of 20mg Oxy, I was 19 years at that time and dropped out of my apprenticeship school after half a year and to afford my use I started working illegal everywhere I could. I also got money from my dad after he died, and from his mother where I worked alot cause she couldnt do much after her only child died so I got about 300-500€ a month from her and from my Other grandparents I also got 200-300€ a month cause they gave me and my brother monthly some money that we can buy a few things cause they knew that we were going through a really hard and challengibg time. So after 1 montb of buying pills I spent about 400-600€ a month on pills, and once when I grabbed some oxy 80s my dboy gave a 3 ballons of dope for free, to test it cause he also started selling H. I tested it by smoking it on the foil, we got Heroin #3 here in my country, and it was the strongest and intense rush and high I ever had, I then decided to just use Heroin akd no more pills. I then buyed once a pill stash of 50x60mg Methadon and 100x40mg Oxycodon for the fact that if I run out of H I can use the pills to not get wds. Ca. in that month I started using Heroin I also started my new apprenticeship as a salesman. I then used Heroin for 1 1/2 years with no break, I used about 5g of 70-80% pure Heroin, it was straight from the brick cut off and I alqays was there when my dboy cut it off, he also tested it everytime how much % it got and if its less than 70% I got 2gs for free, we made that contract after he got a bad brick of just 40% dope, which is still more % than you can get in the open scenes in my area, I was very gratefull for that dboy but sadly after the 1 1/2 years he had to vanish to his country because police had a warrant for him and he would have needed to go to jail for 6 years because they catched him with 10kg of Heroin, 3kg cocaine and 20kg meth. He can come back after 15 years cause then the cops cant get him into jail cause the time frame of his offenses arent actually anymore. He then send me the dope every week and I paid with btc. I also started using benzos daily with the dope I got from him. He always sent me 2 blisters of clonazepam 2mg and 2 blisters of alprazolam 1mg for 4€ a blister, the pills are from the ukraine and 1 blister only costs him 50ct. So I used 5g of constant 75% and 20x2mg clonazepam and 20x1mg Alprazolam a week for the next 1 year and 2 1/2 month. Then I ran out for the first time since I started using. I didnt had enough money and he already fronted me for 2 weeks. So I started selling a few things I got as presents in my life and made about 2000€. But I paid 100€ a month. I received 700€ a month from my apprenticeship and I also got money from my dads 2 insurances so I had about 1200€ a month, I pqid 250€ a month to my mom for food, electricity etc. I also paid about 200€ for gasoline a month, and about 150€ for cigaretts and making party on the weekend but I also started partying much harder by drinking more alcohol, using other drugs like Amphetamin, meth and crack cause I didnt got a rush anymore I just popped enough benzos with the dope and nodded out alot. Then after using 3 years constantly I thought it would be a good idea to start shooting up and not sniffing and smoking anymore. So I IVed for about 2 weeks, I got really bad veins and my docs already need 2-3 tries to hit, so you can imagine how my armes looked and my family recognized it so they forced me to go to detox/rehab, I was there for 5 weeks and at the begining I brought a pack of 200/16mg Tilidin/Naloxon and 12 blisters of 2mg clonazepam and 2 blisters of 2mg Alprazolam and about .2-.3g of dope. They had to throw away the dope and stored the pills for me and I got them they day I gone. I got out of the building and immediatley popped 5 Tilidn and 2 alpraz, 3 clonaz. Jumped on the bus and drove to the place I met with my mom then we drove to KFC to grab a good chicken dinner cause the food at the clinic wasnt that good, typical hospital food. Then after 3 more days of using, I ran out and stopped using for 3 1/2 month. Then I hit up my old dboy and sadly his partner wrote me that he is in jail because 15 of his customers died because he started tweaking for 6 month and also shooting up dope and meth daily and god knows what else.. he started cutting his dope with fent, fent isnt used here in Europe except in one country where only fent is available since nearly 20 years, its estonia when the terrorists in Afghanistan stopped producing Heroin for a year the mai  Heroin countrys received the Heroin which was stored and estonia is hard to reach so the russian mafia started supplying it with the many fentanyl analogues, so the USA can learn from estonia how to handle the fentanyl plague(IDK a better word currently. 

So what I wanted to say is that you eill for sure reach a point where you will decide that its better for yourself to stop using and eventually go to rehab to learn how to handle relapses and the urge to use. I will go in a month to rehab, here rehab is minimum for 3 month and some stay there for up tona year. Also we got the luck that our insurance will pay everything. I think if the USA got the same insurance system like we here in Germany there would be alot of liges saved and people wont go bankrupt if they have a serious health problem and need meds and or have to stay in hospital. 

And sorry for the long text but I got myself a gramm of pure Heroin today and I am high as a kite and got such a extreme urge to speak. So I wish you all of the best and that you can find a way to get clean or to reach a point where its ok for you to use and your happy. Also you should consider getting on methadon or subs. Have a nice day and take care of youtself and your family.",1

You may have cady covered your thread with ""It can be done"" but clearly the other things you said imply different.
 I was on 80mg oxycotin and 10mg oxycodone for 16yrs of course it was lower at the beginning because of a serious back issue I still have, im not going into it. But Junkie? NO!

No, Most ppl here are here because they chose to get help, Because some dr fed them fkn pain pills for 20+ yrs. Instead of teaching them different methods of dealing with different pain. NOT because they were doing it up in an alley way with a fkn dirty needle!!! 

So before u start calling ppl in this thread like me at high doses junkies, piss off. Because most of these ppl like me, Have underlying traumatic issues which is the reason for their addictive personalities, So yeah it may be a cake walk for some but you said its not ur first rodeo? So clearly the program or you chose not to stay clean and find different methods for your pain at your 1st rodeo. Well, This is my first rodeo and I plan to stay off it when done. Even if my ""JUNKIE"" ass needs to stay at a high dose to insure I don't relapse like your junkie ass has done 3 times now. Its not a game to see who can get off it fast enough. Some ppl need real help with PTSD, DID etc....to stay off drugs for good. So, When you do a complete detox down to 0mg, I'll listen to your victory. Because no, You didn't do a full detox at all.

For example, if diamorphin were to be given out in it's purest form (not street heroin), the risks would be wayyy less. ODs usually happen because the dope is laced with fentanyl (or something similar) or because it's a stronger batch than usual. This would not happen if the quality were to be federally regulated and checked, and that can only happen if it's legal. It would also eliminate the criminal side of it, it would no longer have to be smuggled, gangs and cartels would lose power, it would create jobs and would bring in money since the state would tax it.

194,2020-06-21 09:50:14+00:00,"So....I'm on the same side as you - media sucks and wants to bring down the economy and they literally lie to us all the time. But....you know ""even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while""? This is the media's nut. In this sub, we were desperately trying to get the word out for over a month while the media ignored it. Then they jumped all over it. In this instance they happened to be right (which they're happy about).

But....you've got a bunch of stuff to read and watch. Just one of the items they're lying about you just mentioned - ""especially one in which most pe I ple experience no symptoms"". This is 100% false. Here's the breakdown as it has been reported from the beginning: 

80% mild
11% severe
5% critical 
2% die

The media you've been watching (as have I) is pretending that ""mild"" means you simply have a cold or are asymptomatic. That's not what it means. ""Mild"" means you don't require hospitalization. That's right....20% of people have it so bad they require oxygen or vent or ECMO. The rest of the people, in general, say it's awful. Mild means you have a fever, indescribable pain, chills, difficulty breathing huge risk of heart attack and stroke....for 70 days.

This sub was started by fighting fake news. They were all lying to us - even though this was silently spreading. Then when the news announced it, 50% of the nation decided it was crap (like everything else the media says) but again....this one time they're right. 

I told my very republican family - do me a favor. Just pretend, for me, it's very real and dangerous....just for the next few weeks (we set July 14th as the date). Be safe from this....even if it's totally fake, overblown news. If, by July 15th, I haven't been proven right, I'll totally join their side. No masks. No surgeon's booties when I go to the store. We'll party it up and I'll let the kids go back to school. It's just that someone can be asymptomatic for up to 24 days, spreading it, before even knowing they're sick. So wait until the hospitals are flooded with people then make the call.

Also just as a side, my mom died April 15th (she was 62). It was so heart wrenching because you can't even go see them in the hospital, at all. Then when it's time to pull them off the vent you watch them take their last breaths (they're kind and give morphene and Ativan)... but going into the hospital for this shit isn't something you want for you or your family. I promise. Stay safe - I hope you look into some of this because the media is dumb but the real info is out there.",1

An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Houston last year had the Pecan Park Raid where a no knock warrant while not in uniform with no body cams was used to murder the husband Dennis Tuttle 59, wife Rhogena Nicholas 58, and their dog. We the public may never actually know what specifically happened, but the case is still ongoing so maybe we will. 

[What was claimed by the officers was they went in and the dog](https://reason.com/2019/05/06/houston-police-shot-man-killed-in-fraudulent-heroin-raid-at-least-8-times/) attacked them. They shot the dog. They claimed Dennis Tuttle then ran from the back of the house and attacked them with a .357 Magnum Revolver and they had to kill him. During the fight they claim Nicholas tried to reach for an officer's shotgun and they had to kill her. 4 officers were injured by bullets, an[d 1 injured his knee.](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/article/HPD-responding-to-report-of-several-officers-shot-13568491.php?utm_campaign=chron&amp;utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chron.com%2Fnews%2Fhouston-texas%2Fhouston%2Farticle%2FNew-details-emerge-on-Pecan-Park-botched-drug-raid-14816982.php#photo-16844589)

[A private investigator saw little evidence tha](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Evidence-left-behind-after-botched-Pecan-Park-13842488.php)t any bullets were actually ever fired from where Tuttle was inside the house or from anywhere at all inside. Some of the[ bullet holes outside](https://reason.com/2019/05/14/forensic-experts-find-no-evidence-that-houston-narcs-who-killed-dennis-tuttle-and-rhogena-nicholas-encountered-gunfire-as-they-entered-the-house/) the house appear at least a foot away from the door suggesting the officers fired blindly. Dog blood was found away from the door. The .357 Magnum Revolver  was not on the search warrant inventory. 

The justification for the initial no knock warrant was, because Officer Goines claimed a CI went in and bought Heroin and saw a bunch of guns and money too. None of it turned up (except for [2 bags of heroi](https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/2nd-drug-case-involving-embattled-Officer-Gerald-13642869.php)n falsified by another Officer, Goines was able to convince) in the final evidence report except some personal size Marijuana and Cocaine. None of the CI actually went into the house and bought any Heroin. One of the CI he claimed that went in was one [he was sleeping with](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Gerald-Goines-the-Houston-police-officer-at-14856761.php). Eventually it turned out Goines got it from a neighbor who claimed her daughter went in and bought heroin and saw all that stuff. Goines has been charged with first [degree murder by a grand jury and the other officer has been charged with tampering with a government document](https://abcnews.go.com/US/houston-police-officer-gerald-goines-charged-counts-murder/story?id=65165276). So in recap of the earlier police story of what happened. 4 officers got shot somehow and no evidence Tuttle or Nicholas even fired any guns at them. So who shot them? 

The ""lovely"" President of the Houston Police Officer's Union Joe Gamaldi  had this to say about the raid shortly after it happened

We are sick and tired of having dirtbags trying to take our lives when all we're trying to do is protect this community and protect our families. Enough is enough.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Wrong side of the ship I was working at the time, I could feel my energy drain with every breath, too exhausted to shout for help. Around 50 feet of clear water around the boat that I’d have to cross to get to the side of the ship, another 50 to get around to the ladder. When I let go of the polystyrene mass and started kicking, I closed my eyes and the one thought going through my head was “this is it”. 

No energy to cry, I just kept kicking, managed to get to the side of the boat and broke several nails trying to find a perch, by chance, a tender boat from a different ship was passing with tourists and saw me scrambling. Shouted at one of the staff on our ship in Viet, and seconds later I was being dragged out of the water along the barnacles on the side of the ship. I blacked out, woke up a few seconds later to a scary amount of blood pooling on my stomach and serious pain. Once cleaned and morphined, I was relieved that the cuts were numerous but most not deep. But while I was lying there, convinced I was dying, one of my last thoughts I remember being lucid for, was concern that I hadn’t briefed my new co-worker on the entertainment and tonight would bomb if I died. No flash of light, no release of natural painkillers, just pain and anxiety.

Heroin helps me get shit done, methadone is way harder to get off of, has all sideffects of heroin but not a single positive besides reducing withdrawals but not the craving. 

Defining happiness as the absence of suicide inducing pain is not something someone should ever have to do and hailing any other OMT than one based on Diamorphin is inhumane, destructive and amongst all the mounting scientific evidence extremely ( to put it in your word) retarded!

Are we still on Floyd, the career criminal high on meth and fetanyl who wanted to drive away from the scene of him using counterfeit money, who had previously robbed a pregnant woman at gunpoint among nearly a dozen other convictions like drugs and theft, who died of health complications while resisting arrest? That innocent black man?

Or are we on the new one, Rayshard Brooks was out on bail due to Covid. What was this law abiding family man in jail for? He did seven years for child neglect and abuse. While the news pretends he wanted to go home and see his kids, when no, he actually wanted to go home and beat his fucking children. He was approached by cops while passed out drunk twice over the legal limit while driving. He resists arrests, assaults police officers, steals a weapon and dies because of it.

I was in ICU for 3 days, was up and walking at 5 days and left the hospital at 9 days because I hate hospitals and felt like I was just a burden, taking up a bed when I could recover at home at this stage. I spent the entirety of my hospital visit on morphine/oromorph and got to take a little bit home with me, this really helped through the first few weeks, but was put on codeine afterwards, which also helped with sleep.

The accident happened because I wasn't paying enough attention to the road, and hit a small hump bridge over a river at speed, effectively making it a jump as I was doing between 60-80mph. I just remember hitting the tank and it winding the fuck out of me. Then when the ground-sky-ground-sky stopped I crawled out of the brush I was in, without my helmet on. I never saw it after the accident so I assume it came off during the resulting crash, hence the head injuries as the clocks on my dash couldn't have fractured my skull/jaw.

The pain is something that I'll never forget, mainly because I still carry it daily. My back and ribs will never feel right again, though luckily I'm still able to walk and have full feeling/control below my shoulders. If my spinal breaks were a half-inch to the left, I'd be paralysed.

If the ambulance service had have sent a road-ambulance, I'd have died at the scene, as I was entering shock at the side of the road and blacked out soon after their arrival.

The broken rib pain is honestly the most unbearable pain I've ever felt in my life. I can't imagine how your partner must be feeling with 13 total broken. My heart goes out to you both. The following months are going to be extremely tough and he's going to require a lot of looking after. I'm glad he has you and family to look after him.

I share this story every time I see a chance. It feels like every time I tell the story I move on from it a little more.",1

313,2020-06-15 06:36:26+00:00,"The equilivant price of, say, modern orajel lidocaine numbing cream for the cocaine tooth drops. Probably a dollar for a tin, back then, which would be a silver dollar coin, perhaps a golden dollar coin or a dollar bill that states it's convertable to silver on demand (at banks and stuff). I have seen vintage advertising, and cocaine numbing medicine, morphine baby soothing drops, etc. 

They were usually a buck a tin. These were drops, losenges and tablets. Perhaps pure powder to be rubbed on gums where the teeth hurt was another way drugs were sold.

Primitive tablets did exist at the time, and the measurements were in grains not milligrams. For example, a common diarrhea medicine I believe was Codeine and Lead tablets... Lead stops bowel movements and Codeine metabolizes into Morphine to constipate you. Tablets of some kind have been around since the 1850s.

 Equilivant of a bottle of cough syrup or Tylenol now is what we'd pay for a 8 oz bottle of pretty concentrated Opium tincture 1920. $10 equilivance, I'd wager a dollar and fifty cents in 1920 dollars. Same for a tincture of Cannabis Indica, Sativa, Atropine, etc - Queen Victoria used this (opium tincture) for her menstrual cramps, King George took morphine liquid (and Cocaine, to boot) to ease his death back in the 20s or 10s I think. Two bucks tops for a stronger bottle. 

For preparing liquid medicine, one first had to pulverise the material containing drug - usually it needed to be dried out, and was typically plant material like opium pods, cannabis buds, etc. It also needed to be pulverized in a pestle and mortar into a powder consistancy. Tinctures require measurements, weights and uses alcohol as a solvent and the pharmacist had to be precise to get accurate concentration of ingredients. They're time consuming to make, adding to the cost. The high proof alcohol uses as the solute for the drug added to the cost as well.

I remember the sears catalog advertising heroin plus needles as a kit was something like $2.75? Came with a cool leather case. The ad was from 1906 or something. Since 1880s (or was it the 1850s) we have been able to isolate the many opiates from poppy pods - codeine, morphine, thebaine - and not long after did they learn to purify them into 100% pure powders. And make the morphine into heroin, which was 2.2x the strength of morphine. During World War 1 the Codones were discovered, Oxycodone and Hydrocodone, related to Codeine and made using thebaine. The 1920a led to the Morphones - hydromorphone and oxymorphone, using thebaine and similar to morphines properties (low oral bioavailability, for example). Oxymorphone is 80 times the strength of Codeine, if I recall. These were discovered by the Germans, usually by Bayer, the same company that discovered how to make Aspirin and Heroin. In the 1930s, the Germans discovered how to make Methadone - the first opioid with a duration of 12+ hours (all previous opioids and opiates lasted 3-4 hours). I believe codeine was used a lot within cough syrups, but North America stuck to Codeine for minor pains and Morphine (and briefly Heroin) for major pains - Europeans made use of the Codones and the such. The main reason Germany was on a discovery frenzy for painkillers was that they were either in war, preparing for war, and had embargos preventing opium poppy imports. This led to them needing to make synthetics, like Methadone.
 
Wax capsules that melted in the rectum and could be filled with a medicine were 20 for a dollar in a catalogue I read, 1890s. They were one of the first supposetories and capsules.

Early sedatives like bromides and chloral hydrate did wonders for epilepsy. They could have used capsules but often fed the epileptics spoonfuls of the medication. The side effects were bad, but the barbiturates discoveted in 1902 with Barbital were noted to help epilepsy. Tons of barbiturates were discovered, Allobarbital in 1912 to Amobarb, Aprobarb, Cyclobarb in the 20s. All lacked a long enough half life for epilepsy. Phenobarbital in 1920 was groundbreaking for epilepsy, due to its long half life (up to 200 hours) giving all day relief. The brand name for phenobarbital was Luminal, and is still used today for epilepsy. Barbiturates were the first medicines used in oral capsules due to taste of the crystalized barbiturate, made with things like Urea (a waste product, y'know... Urine). Legend has it that they used the urine if a barmaid named Barbera for the urea to use in making barbital for the first time, and she is the drugs namesake.

From my understanding, you could buy barbiturates like any other thing, prescriptions and drug laws/regulations appeared in 1926 - and even then those were pretty lax, focusing on opioids and cocaine. i read in an old catalogue bottles of Veronal (Barbital) being 2 - 5 buckS for 30-100 capsules of like 5 grains with 10 - 15 grains a dose - a dose of 2 - 3 tablets, so a 2 dollar bottle of 30 at 3 tablets a dose is 30 cents per dosage. Pretty pricy, but they were the first effective sleep drug. For context, chocolate bars at the time were 8 cents and so were loaves of bread. 

Prior to the barbiturates, all they had were the bromides (toxic as fuck), chloral hydrates, ethers and chloroforms (rare, typically used for surgeries) and ethanol (Whiskey). Yes, doctors wrote whiskey prescriptions and during the prohibition era, you could get medicinal whiskey with a prescription label and it would literally have instructions like ""drink 2 oz before bed for insomnia"" or ""drink 1 oz as needed to settle your nerves"". So barbiturates were a reliable medication for sleep, anxiety, ""hysteria"" and psychaitry.

Most barbiturates are not used anymore due to overdose potential. They killed Jimi Hendrix, Janice Joplin, Elvis Presley, among many others - the ones synthed in the'30s like secobarb and pentobarb were monsters. Taking 2 or 3 capsules when the prescription called for one could lead to overdosing, especially when alcohol is mixed in... Jimi took 9 Brillobarbital pills and a glass of wine. The only use they have for these deadly barbiturates is euthenasia in both humans and animals, or lethal injections... Apparently Mexican vets sell pentobarbital for putting down dogs to pet owners, for the owner to give to the dog... And suicide tourists travel there to buy this to end their lives -, mexican vets don't tend to need prescriptions.",1

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.",1

Youd need blood work, biospy, capilary fold tests, and so much more to even beging to diagnosis if you have scleroderma and then even the type. Youre best off getting a biopsy of the changed skin. If you have scleroderma itll come back as excess collagen or morphea. Morphea in the test result does not mean you necessarily have morphea you can still have any type of scleroderma. Id see your GP and get the speciliazed blood tests since it can help seeing the right doctor as well as a biopsy. You can also look into the scleroderma foundation website and youtube videos. The localized scleroderma video from 2018 actually generalizes alot of the forms of the disease. Morphea itself doesnt attack the fingers so that would rule out morphea. Since youre having digestive issues id be concerned about the systemic forms of the disease: Sine scleroderma, Diffuse systemic scleroderma, Limited scleroderma, and Multiple connective tissue disease.

Says the guy screaming rape over 2 drunk people making out and sleeping on the ground on the way to the dorm. If there was any objective fact here, Brock Turner would have gotten 0 days incarcerated. 

The case against turner is so weak it doesn't even involve a victim calling the police. It involves a passerby white knight calling the police for the woman, and the woman herself initially avoiding to incriminate Turner. Both were fully clothed, no rape, no penetration, 3 months in jail for vajayjay rubbing with someone you were making out with, and years of incessant harassment, literal hundreds of subhumans like you trying to get him to kill himself. 

I think it's nice how some BLM people try to juxtapose this with Floyd, it truly shows the double standards. Floyd pointed a gun at people's faces, got charged for theft because in high crime areas the workload is so heavy the prosecutors just throw slaps on the wrists so the cases aren't easy to appeal. Floyd was walking around with half an anesthesia of fetanyl, known to stop breathing, no one cared. Floyd had 5 abandoned children. Floyd was a porner, prostitute client. Yet, Floyd is a saint, Brock Turner deserves to be harassed for the rest of his life, after already doing time. 

Brock Turner, by tickling the attention of social justice warriors and ideological freaks, got a punishment hundreds of times out of proportion over the no-punishemnt he deserved. Had Brock Turner done a little bit of meth and sucker punched a woman or something, had he been an actual violent criminal, he would have gone in and out of jail and his life would probably be more salvageable.",1

Likewise, other addicitons are result of the endorphins (similar to morphone) that your body releases naturally in the presence of a particular act.  Endorphins are released for various reasons, including fear, pain, intense physical stress (including exercise), or even excitement and joy.   

The lack of these endorphins are what encourages people to partake in whatever gets themselves stimulated again so they feel that natural ""rush"" again. 

If using magic causes you to release those endorphins, there's no reason a person couldnt get addicted to it.   That's not to say everyone would or could, everyone's natural triggers are different, but it's easy to appreciate how some could.",1

A lot of the older generation are very clueless regarding drugs, and very likely read oxycotin and saw a red flag of fuck my kids gna be a smackhead.

And if you read my post i said to speak to them. Not us. If they still wont understand call the dr. Or get otc stuff. Of all the people in the world, you definately can reason with your parents.

You cant get half way through the conversation and say actually no, i think this is the wrong choice. They will be at your door within the hour and you will all be investigated.

You can and definately should manage pain without the use of opiates. Especially at auch a young age. Usa have a very different stance on pain releif, and its not surprising you were sent home with oxys.

Cps or cops or whatever will fuck shit up for you so bad. Your parents will fucking HATE you. Right now you think they are cunts i agree, but in 3 weeks time when your pain is gone you can look back n say they really are fucking stupid. But they care for you. They are most likely scared of the drugs and id garantee they didnt even look at the packets n just assumed you got given a huge course of oxys.

Talvez pela sua época também fosse, não é tão fácil precisar. Os maiores defeitos de Churchill também são causa de suas maiores virtudes que é a obstinação. Churchill foi um crítico dos nazistas desde o começo e se negou a negociar com hitler, coisas que por exemplo Stalin fez e até coperou com os nazistas antes da invasão da união soviética.

Existem outras coisas pelo qual churchill é controverso: fome de bengala, kenya, bombardeio de dresden.... Muitos desses são assuntos longe de ser simples e eu também não conheço bem.

Porem ele é heroi por se levantar e se recusar abaixar a cabeça contra os nazistas numa época que todo mundo tava coperando ou se fazendo de besta.

351,2020-06-13 09:26:42+00:00,"&gt; Because African Americans have always been less economically successful than their white American counterparts, in general African Americans live areas that are serviced by lesser schools. Which makes it harder for them to get into college, harder for them to live the lives they deserve, and much easier for a bigot to say ""oh well, of course I don't like them, they are uneducated."" 

Worse schools definitely don't help but I think it's facile to lay everything at the hands of the state in regards to this.  Parents need to not only value education, but force the child to value that education as well by enforcing discipline.  Without that it is difficult for teachers to make much progress.  With a significant percentage of black families being single parent and in precarious financial positions, it's hard to see how someone who is working several jobs at the same time is going to have the mental space to scholastically coach their children.  Especially when the general culture does not seem to understand what is required in order to succeed in schools.

Furthermore, there are definite interconnected issues that prevent inner city schools from providing proper schooling.  Traumatized children acting out in the classroom, kids in precarious home situations, the drug trade, violence etc. will all create a toxic morass that keeps adding headwind to the efforts of children.  These are not school related issues and I don't see how overloading teachers with more duties is going to help things out.  We need better incentives and social policy reform to help address these issues.  Throwing money at schools is looking at the immediate symptom rather than looking at the environment that is supporting it.

And the environment punishes all mercilessly.  The drug war and it's toxic effects are not just limited to black people.  We are seeing rhymes of the same interconnected problems in poor white rural communities where meth and oxycotin combined with economic malaise have led to widespread despair.  Where people who have relied on manufacturing are never getting their jobs back and have never embraced a culture of scholastic success.  The rules that we have created will grind down people of all colors and cultures if they are put in similar settings.  That should be the message.

Race is a red herring.  The entire point is that the numbers do not support the argument that Nigerian Americans (or members of any race) suffer from systemic racism from police.  Which should definitely be the case if the police are systemically racist to all people of black ethnicity.  Trying to claim that Nigerean Americans dress differently to identify themselves sounds . . . a little interesting.  A cursory glance at Nigerian Americans show they dress like most middle class or affluent Americans do.   Furthermore by invoking class and culture in this you have implicitly admitted that it is not solely race that is the issue, but a confluence of other factors that have contributed to the situation where we are at.  None of this erases past injustices.  We need to be cognizant that the problems of the past are not the problems of now.

&gt; From opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, they made the case that social breakdown among low-income whites was starting to mimic trends that had begun decades earlier among African Americans: Rates of out-of-wedlock births and male joblessness were rising sharply. Then came the stories about a surge in opiate addiction among white Americans, alongside shocking reports of rising mortality rates (including by suicide) among middle-aged whites.

&gt; https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/the-original-underclass/492731/

Just to be nitpicky, African Americans have definitely been more financially successful than white people at points in history.  White people were just quick to correct that.  A different time.

355,2020-06-13 02:01:32+00:00,"What a wonderfully written trip report and just what I was looking for to answer my question “what is tripping”? I’ve had a few substances like shrooms and 6-APB that made lights breath or even the whole room but I’ve rarely seen visuals like you describe. Best thing I have is the walkway in a Dutch train at night looking like a flowing stream and when we sat down in our seats, it was as if the lights lit up just for us. That was a pretty awesome trip for me and my friends in those days (late 90s). I’ve always been scared to try LSD, mostly because of what I read or heard at the time which was when the Internet just became a thing (yes, I’m that old). What concerns me most is losing the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy during a trip. With shrooms things could get wacky but if you really wanted to, you could shake yourself out of it before it would slowly return again. I’m told that with LSD this is not so easy to do. You’re in it for the ride, whether you like it or not. The fact that I lost my father around the time I was doing drugs (mid-to-late 90s), I didn’t want to trip and run into my father or something. I know full well that being afraid is a great way to have a bad experience so I never tried it. Now I’m a lot older and I’m not afraid anymore to see my old man, heck, I would even welcome it. I have some questions for him, for sure! So maybe I will give it a go in the near-ish future. Thanks for sharing this and as has been said before, you have a great writing style. Amazing how many details you’ve retained over such a long period of time. I imagine you wrote down notes during the trip? I will finish by saying that the preface that you give is incredibly on point, it is my pet peeve that people pile on the crap when it’s about “drugs” but just as easily drink strong alcohol, smoke tobacco and take oxycotin to forget about all the pain; soooo hypocritical it makes me furious.",1

PRE REQUISITO: GOSTAR DE FILMES DE FAROESTE.

&amp;#x200B;

IMPORTANTE: Se você gosta de filmes de super heroi, pare de ler e va se foder.

&amp;#x200B;

Se você é assim, fique longe de mim.

&amp;#x200B;

NÃO QUERO AS MULHERES QUE:

As que falam palavrões

As que fumam

As que usam drogas

As que postam foto com bebida

Que bebem (menos 🍷, isso é coisa de dama)

As que vão para balada, festa, rave etc

As que postam fotos com short curto, decote ou sensuais

&amp;#x200B;

Há uma coisa que eu quero que você entenda sobre nós os homens.

&amp;#x200B;

Quando você colocar uma foto sua nua no facebook, fazendo uma pose gostosa, mostrando os seios ou como vemos em várias fotos mostrando o bumbum ou deitada sedutoramente em sua cama, a única coisa que você faz é que as pessoas tenham desejo sexual por você, claro em A maioria dos casos por parte de homens.

&amp;#x200B;

Eu sei que você vai ficar tão emocionada com os 500 likes, 120 comentários e as inúmeras mensagens privadas! Você vai querer postar cada vez mais fotos para se sentir cada vez mais no topo.

&amp;#x200B;

Mas há algo importante que você precisa saber:

&amp;#x200B;

Na verdade nenhum desses caras que gostam, comentam ou enviam mensagens privadas te ama. Tudo o que eles querem é usá-la e depois atirá-la para o lixo, para ser honesto nenhum deles a levaria para sua casa para ser sua esposa, acredite em mim, você para eles não é mais que uma menina de programa em busca de popularidade barata No Facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

Os homens ricos os que tem o que você procura ""dinheiro"" ou os pobres admiram as mulheres que se vestem com decência e se respeitam. Uma vestimenta decente que não revela muito o seu corpo, leva-os a amar e a respeitar-te, isto a simples vista nos diz que és uma mulher virtuosa, alguém a quem se pode levar para casa para ser esposa e mãe.

&amp;#x200B;

Isto em muitos casos diz-lhes que você foi criada com princípios morais e lhes dá detalhes do seu bom histórico familiar.

&amp;#x200B;

Eles não se preocupam muito com a maquiagem excessiva, uma mulher digna de propor casamento sempre se distingue do monte, não importa como.

&amp;#x200B;

Valoriza seu corpo, lembre-se que para encontrar diamantes é preciso cavar, respeita, e um verdadeiro homem vai te respeitar de um modo ou de outro.

&amp;#x200B;

Mas você terá muito respeito: Mulher, não mostre seu corpo no facebook, você não sabe que tipo de pessoas, venha suas coisas, você é uma mulher bela, não precisa de fotos, nem mostrar tanto, você pode conquistar com sua simpatia, com seu educacióncon seu sonrrisa,

&amp;#x200B;

As que já ficaram com amigos seus, ou que ficam com mais de 3 em um único ano

As que não trabalham ou estudam (ou que estão em um curso irrelevante de humanas)

As que não sabem o básico de uma casa, como lavar, passar roupa, cozinhar, trocar fralda, etc

As interesseiras

As que estão pedindo presentes sempre

As que já estão comprometidas

As não gostam de crianças ou dizem que não querem ter filhos (pessoas que não querem ter filhos não são confiáveis)

As que tem piercing de bufalo",1

« Bernardo Ramírez Blanco, de 58 años de edad, hermano de la vicepresidente de Colombia, Marta Lucía Ramírez Blanco, en 1997 fue arrestado y condenado en Estados Unidos a cuatro años y nueve meses de prisión por tráfico de heroína. Cuando tuvo oportunidad de salir libre, la fianza, de US$ 150 mil, la pagó ella junto con su esposo, Álvaro Rincón, ambos enredados hoy por sus nexos comerciales con el narcotraficante Guillermo León Acevedo Giraldo, alias “Memo Fantasma.”

Al pago de la fianza también contribuyó alguien identificada como Luz Mireya Rodríguez.

El hermano de la vicepresidente fue detenido en Miami en julio de 1997, cuando recibía un cargamento de heroína que dos “mulas”, reclutadas por él, transportaron por vía aérea desde Aruba. A su regreso, llevaron la droga en cápsulas que se tragaron, fabricadas con condones, dicen la acusación y la sentencia judicial condenatoria.

La acusación estuvo a cargo de la Fiscalía Federal para el Distrito Sur de la Florida y el juicio se llevó ante la Corte Federal del mismo distrito.

El investigador del caso fue el agente de la DEA Shaun Perry, quien tuvo información según la cual los colombianos residentes en Miami Alejandra Osorio Vargas y Miguel José Aguilera Asencio viajarían a Aruba y regresarían con un alijo de heroína entre sus estómagos.

En efecto, de acuerdo con el agente Perry, ambos llegaron en el vuelo número 760 de Air Aruba, el 12 de julio y fueron arrestados cuando se disponían a entregarle la droga ilícita a Ramírez Blanco.

Durante la campaña electoral que la llevó a la vicepresidencia de Colombia, Marta Lucía Ramírez nunca les informó a sus electores que tenía un hermano narcotraficante al que había liberado con una fianza.
El hermano de la hoy vicepresidenta, de acuerdo con la acusación, reclutó a Osorio Vargas y Aguilera Asencio en Miami y los envió a recoger la droga en Aruba, donde se la tragaron y regresaron dos días después.

El agente Perry reveló que los datos obtenidos por sus fuentes coincidieron con las listas de pasajeros que solicitó a Air Aruba en las que, evidentemente, figuraban Osorio Vargas y Aguilera Asencio.

El 16 de julio, dice Perry, supo que ambos colombianos ya habían regresado a Miami y se dirigió a la residencia de Vargas en Miami Beach. A las 5:30 de ese día Perry y otros dos oficiales de la DEA montaron sendos puestos de vigilancia a los edificios donde vivían Osorio Vargas y Aguilera Asencio.

Posteriormente, el agente Perry se percató de que Aguilera Asencio salió con una cartera de viaje y un estuche porta-CDs. Lo alcanzó, lo interceptó y le pidió identificarse.

Aguilera Asencio explicó que recientemente había llegado de Aruba junto con Osorio Vargas.

A continuación, los agentes visitaron a Osorio Vargas y ella dio la misma explicación. También fue arrestada y llevada al hospital Mount Sinai, donde fue sometida a Rayos X. Entre 16 y 18 de julio Osorio Vargas expulsó 65 capsulas de heroína y Aguilera Asencio 35.

El 17 de julio los agentes encontraron 35 capsulas más en la bolsa de viaje de Aguilera Asencio.

Vargas y Aguilera Asencio decidieron cooperar con los agentes y les contaron que le iban a entregarle la droga al hermano de la actual vicepresidente de Colombia, Bernardo Ramírez Blanco. Explicaron que él fue la persona que “los dirigió para que fueran a Aruba a obtener la heroína y quien recibiría la droga a la llegada a Miami”, sostiene el agente Perry.

El 18 de julio de 1997, alrededor de las 4:45 de la tarde, Vargas habló por teléfono con Ramírez. La conversación fue grabada por la DEA y el agente Perry la reveló en juicio.

Las dos “mulas” quedaron en encontrarse con Ramírez en Aventura Mall para entregarle la droga.

El encuentro se produjo a las 7:52 pm. Osorio Vargas le dijo al hermano de la vicepresidente Ramírez Blanco que tenía la droga afuera, en su vehículo, fue a retirarla y regresó.

Ramírez Blanco y Osorio Vargas tuvieron una discusión y posteriormente se produjo el arresto de él. El narcotraficante pidió que se le permitiera ir hasta Nueva York con el objeto de encontrarse con su hermana Marta Lucía Ramírez Blanco, quien, aseguró, era una persona muy importante que podría solucionar esta situación penal por tráfico de heroína.


El pasado 7 de abril, la organización Insight Crime reveló la identidad del narcotraficante colombiano Guillermo León Acevedo Giraldo, conocido con los alias de ‘Sebastián Colmenares’ o ‘Memo Fantasma’ quien tiene negocios inmobiliarios con la vicepresidenta Marta Lucía Ramírez Blanco y su esposo, Álvaro Rincón. »

377,2020-06-11 23:28:47+00:00,"Demi isn't about ""not wanting to bone straight away"". Asexuality is about having no interest in boning anyone AT ALL. Demis are on that spectrum, having no interest in boning at all UNTIL the emotional connection is made. We physically and mentally have no sexual impulses to be with another person, and often not any physical attraction, no matter if we're hetero-, homo-, or bi-, until that connection is established. There is about as much pleasure in having sex with someone we don't know, as a gay man would have in boning a woman. 


In simplified scientific terms, our oxycotin is not released in sufficient quantities to want to get intimate with someone until we have had prolonged exposure to it in response to being around that person. Meanwhile, the physical act of sex without that connection does not produce enough dopamine to make the act enjoyable. It is not a ""personality quirk"", it is a mechanism of our biology. 


People used to call being gay some sort of ""personality quirk"" or defect before it was validated as an actual form of attraction. Just because there are more subtle forms of minority emotional and sexual attraction and expression, beyond the gender people are physically attracted to and the gender they physically want to express, doesn't invalidate our experiences. 


Not all demis consider themselves part of the LGBT+ group. But that + once read as ""LGBTQA"", where A is for Asexuals.

We may never actually know what specifically happened, but the case is still ongoing. 

[What was claimed by the officers was they went in and the dog](https://reason.com/2019/05/06/houston-police-shot-man-killed-in-fraudulent-heroin-raid-at-least-8-times/) attacked them. They shot the dog. They claimed Dennis Tuttle then ran from the back of the house and attacked them with a .357 Magnum Revolver and they had to kill him.

Some of the[ bullet holes outside](https://reason.com/2019/05/14/forensic-experts-find-no-evidence-that-houston-narcs-who-killed-dennis-tuttle-and-rhogena-nicholas-encountered-gunfire-as-they-entered-the-house/) the house appear at least a foot away from the door suggesting the officers fired blindly. Dog blood was found away from the door. The .357 Magnum Revolver  was not on the search warrant inventory. 

The justification for the initial no knock warrant was, because Officer Goines claimed a CI went in and bought Heroin and saw a bunch of guns and money too. None of it turned up (except for [2 bags of heroi](https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/2nd-drug-case-involving-embattled-Officer-Gerald-13642869.php)n falsified by another Officer, Goines was able to convince) in the final evidence report except some personal size Marijuana and Cocaine. None of the CI actually went into the house and bought any Heroin.

Goines has been charged with first [degree murder by a grand jury and the other officer has been charged with tampering with a government document](https://abcnews.go.com/US/houston-police-officer-gerald-goines-charged-counts-murder/story?id=65165276).

He had 11ng/ml of fentnanyl and 5.6 ng/ml of norfentanyl. Combined with the methamphetamine in his system, this is a big factor of why he died. On top of that, he had a heart condition which the medical examiner lists as “severe.” All of these conditions combined with police officers using the tactics they did contributed to his death.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Only about 10% of raw opium is actual morphine. Then when they convert the morphine to dicetylmorphine (aka heroin) it’s only about 5% of the original weight. That makes it much easier to smuggle. No criminal organization is going to smuggle raw opium across international borders because as I just explained, it’s way too bulky, and secondly, there’s no demand for it.",7

Not necessarily, no - he had 11ng/ml in his blood - that is a high amount, no doubt - but for example, in one study of overdoses the mean blood level was 5 times that at 52.9 ng/mL. I've seen cases cited where the fatal amount is around 11ng, but it's typically higher, and this really depends on Floyd's tolerance.

He was clearly moving around in video directly before the incident (standing and walking handcuffed with officers), able to communicate, and actively resist being seated in the car, saying he was claustrophobic. The amount in him still could have caused non-fatal respiratory depression that made him much more likely to die when restrained the way he was in addition to his heart disease, but it remains that he clearly died during, and thus as a result of that restraint.

It kind of seems like you want it both ways - that he was ""nearly collapsing"" before the arrest, yet was simultaneously capable of being such a physical threat in his resistance that 3 men had to actively pin him down - which is it?

In regards to the legal angle: in MN, for 2nd degree murder, you don't even have to have intent to kill to be guilty - you can be guilty of 2nd degree murder if someone dies as a result of you committing a felony that isn't murder. A number of legal experts have said if you steal an old lady's purse and she dies of cardiac arrest during the struggle for it - you're guilty of 2nd degree murder which there's precedent for - at least in MN and other similar jurisdictions.

Additionally, George Floyd worked with Derek Chauvin as a bouncer in the same place, they knew one another, and witnesses have said they had a contentious relationship over Floyd's feeling he was too rough with patrons. That could show Chauvin had possible intent and will make it a whole lot worse for him.",1

This is the natural consequence of drug prohibition - impose arbitrary costs on the drug market in the form of inefficient policing and border controls and the market will naturally tend towards the most concentrated forms of the desired high that can be found. If you have to smuggle it in up some guy's asshole, the $/rectum is a hell of a lot higher with fentanyl than with resinous opium. 

The actual *cost* of a dose of heroin or morphiene is really quite low. We could just give it to every addict in the country, on demand, and we'd probably be saving money just in ER visits from dirty drugs. Nevermind the sheer volume of crime that's currently committed in order to allow these addicts to exchange money with organized crime to get their high.

We had \~20K worth of stainless equipment stolen recently, sold to a scapper for (i'm sure) less than a couple hundred bucks and then immediately destroyed (we found it less than 4 hrs later, but ruined). Probably cost us over 150K in lost revenue that we're still trying to make back up through OT and expensive replacement equipment. I'd be happy to see my and my companys taxes going to subsidize that not happening any more.

The cops lost the drug war, completely. I'd like to see legalization and medicalization of all drugs - let addicts get what they need at cost through pharmacies, with a doctor's note. We've tried this, and it fucking works, but it's 'conservative' forces that want to see everyone subsidizing organized crime through theft. I just do not get it.",1
442,2020-06-10 02:39:08+00:00,"Ok, I'm on the ""we should legalize all drugs"" side of the argument.

 The reasons are as follows: a decent number of drugs that are schedule 1 are 100% safe, weed is used for people to feel better and recreationally, you can't overdose on psychedelics and they have been shown in multiple trials to help people overcome both addiction and depression.

There are slightly more dangerous drugs that are still useful, though not 100% safe also being used for depression cases, such as mdma and ketamine, which just require a little more care than weed or lsd.

If drugs were legal, then people wouldn't have to worry if there was too much fenanyl, and we could move the money that were using to throw drug sellers and buyers into jail into better rehabilitation centers so they don't ruin their life or get it ruined by the government.

Last thing I have to say is that the reason most people are on opioids is that they got hurt and a doctor prescribed them vicadin when they really needed something less strong, and that's due to lobbying by large pharmecutical companies to sell more stuff. But once their injury is healed, then they can't get access to the drugs that they got addicted to, so dealers popped up to solve that problem which should never have been in the first place.

The war on drugs should be over because it's used to throw minorites in jail.

The prefix of Hydro means its more potent than something without ""hydro""

The prefix of oxy means its more potent than something with ""hydro""

if it doesnt have a prefix with oxy or hydro means its the weakest

This applies to simi-synthetic opioids ONLY!!!! Fully synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl or methadone will not have a prefix at all but they are the strongest, with exception for tramadol and tapentadol, which were created to be similar to codeine and dihydrocodeine.

opiates (Not Opioids) are pre-curser drugs that come directly out of the poppy plant and are used to make simi-synthetic drugs with the ""hydro"" and ""oxy"" prefix. Codeine, morphine, and thebain are ""opiates"", and are either equal to, or less than any simi synthetic opioid. If you add hydro to morphine, you get ""hydromorphone"". If you add oxy to morphine, you get ""Oxymorphone"". If you add ""hydro"" to codeine, you get hydrocodone. If you add ""oxy"" to thebain or codeine, you get ""oxycodone"". Adding those prefixes makes them stronger than their original form.

Oxymorphone   (Oxygenated morphine)

Hydromorphone   (Hydrated Morphine)

Oxycodone   (Oxygenated codeine)

Hydrocodone   (Hydrated Codeine)

Morohine is stronger than codeine, so when you add ""oxy"" or ""hydro"" to anything with morphine (morphone) it will be stronger than any ""hydro"" or ""oxy"" added to codeine (Codone). But ""oxy"" is greater than ""hydro"", so ""Oxy"" Codeine (Codone) will be stronger than ""hydro"" codeine (Codone). Same is true with Morphine (Morphone)  products.

In order to get any stronger than oxygenated morphine, you have to create a full synthetic not based off a natural opiate such as codeine or morphine. This is where you get fentanyl. It's 100% lab created.",2

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution.

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

#*Pressed pill inquiries are not permitted under any circumstances.*

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

Yep, just like engineering, physics, and other professional disciplines, we've had a long history of mistakes we've learned from.

It's the conservatives what are clinging to the past mistakes here.  Medicine has realized its mistakes.  Conservatives want to keep failed treatments like gay conversion therapy.  They're the ones on the ""lobotomy"" side today.  The ones clinging to past cruelties based on past mistakes.

516,2020-06-07 06:28:35+00:00,"I would document it without calling it out as a mistake in the patient care report itself. Like in your example, I would just say I gave ""0.5 mg/kg Versed to treat for seizure"" and write how the patient reacted after (personally, I usually don't even write the dose in the narrative so I'd just say administered ""Versed to treat for seizure"", but that's because we have a treatment/medication section where it's already documented). I would immediately call a supervisor at the end of the call to ask for guidance. Where we work, we have incident reports where we can admit mistakes and who we notified. If you have such a thing, I'd fill that out.

I once accidentally wasn't paying attention, didn't do my medication rights correctly, and gave the wrong medication. There were many factors: It was my first time working a night shift in a long time, I had the flu, and I was rushing since we were close to the hospital. I read the vial thinking ""M.. Morphine"". It never occurred to me that M could be Midazolam. I always thought of it as Versed. I remember thinking ""Hm... that's weird... 5 mg/mL? They must've changed manufacturers."" even though I checked out the meds at the start of the shift. I did not consider the way the vial looked, size, or color (Midazolam has a beer bottle brown color vial, slightly bigger, green cap while Morphine is smaller, clear, and has an orange cap, at least for us). My patient PASSED OUT after I pushed it. I couldn't tell if she was breathing, thought she took the Morpine too hard, and pushed Narcan. The patient did wake up a little, but it still didn't occur to me that I made a medication error. It wasn't until I was filling out the narcotic card that I realized my screw up. I immediately called a supervisor, told the hospital, and the supervisor had me fill out two forms. I was placed on unpaid admin leave and our clinical education department interviewed me to try to figure out how this happened. At the end, they put me on a paramedic/personal improvement plan where I had to take several online medication administration classes, had to work dual medic for 6 months, and had someone from clinical education do a ride along to get me off tje improvement plan. Ugh. I will never make that mistake ever again... I do multiple checks including just before pushing. I take my time. For dosage, although I have never made a dosage error, I will review protocols for infrequent meds and double check math.

Most of us will make mistakes at some point. I hope that it will be a learning point for you rather than a punishment or termination.

Not gonna lie... I was extremely embarrassed by my mistake. It stuck with me a long time. Now when other people make mistakes, I try to be understanding. We are human and even the best of us aren't perfect I think.",4

We were partying every weekend from 15-21 years old. Then they knew that I am addicted to dope cause I went to detox and a short 3 week rehab. Which was a total waste of time. I went to detox with 20x200/16mg Tilidin/Nqloxon and 80x2mg clonazepam, they were forced to store my pills and give them back to me when I leave cause I got a Script for both, then directly after I left I popped 5 Tilidin qnd 7 clonazepam, man that was the nicest bus drive home that I ever had, LOL, btw it was a faked script which I made on my PC with a Darknet Software and then I went to my pharmacy and got me the pills whenever I wanted or I was doctor ahopping for stronger pills like morphine and oxycodon. But I used pills only for halfa year and then switched to heroin untill now. Currently I am waiting for my insurance to get the letter that they pay my drug therapy, in my country everyone got a insurance, except a few homeless guys, and I was forced to change places because of my Epilepsie so I will probably receive the letter in the next week and then I need to go to detox because od corona and then I will go to inpatient seug therapy for 4-9 month qnd they also help me findibg a job and then I can live in their sober house. So I am really looking forward to go to therapy and learn how to live sober and also maybe I can work on the suicide of my dad and how I found him. But my main goal is to learn how to live sober and happy. Also I think moving away from the town where I connect so many places with using drugs will be good too. So thats the end of my story, sorry for the long text the booze and dope make me super talkactive. So have a good night/day whatever time it is at yours and thanks again for the help mate.",1

529,2020-06-06 20:48:56+00:00,"Dude.... i never said people started off using fentnyl. I said the deaths were driven by fentanyl. Im going to give you a link to a chart in my next post that will put the direct connection between the opioid deaths and fentanyl. And my other points were not ""what about-ism""... It was juxtaposition. The idea of holding two thought in your head at the same time. We have had large amounts of opioid addiction in this country since the late 60's and 70's when heroin was brought into the country during the Vietnam war. That's when opioid addiction took off. Purdue pharma had nothing to do with that. The argument of ""Oxycontin to heroin"" is complete BS. The majority of people who use heroin... STARTED WITH HEROIN. 96% of prescription users didn't move on to heroin... You know why? Because they had a freaking Rx. The best response to the fentanyl crisis would have been to offer oxycodone and hydromorphone at clinics. You have to deal in reality. These people are going to seek opiates regardless if oxy is on the market. Giving them access to a oxy program would have saved so many lives. Because government screwed it up, doesnt give anyone the right to blame purdue. They were a tiny percentage of the opioid prescriptions. My other point was about other drugs of abuse. There is no prescription for cocaine... yet millions are abusing it. Their is adderall and vyvance... are they responsible for meth addiction??? The point in that is to obliterate the connection between prescription availability and addiction. The black market is responsible for deadly addictions. Yes, oxycontin was out in the streets, but in a free market where people need access to an essential medication, your going to have abuse. The answer is not to sue and restrict... your just creating more suffering and death. The answer is to expand access and create regulated programs for those addicted. Government policy is behind all the deaths. If your blaming purdue, you cant see the forest through the trees.",1

If you feel so confident that Perdue has no blame, post it on the opiate subreddit and watch how quickly you get manhandled in your lack of understanding about what actually happened during the crisis. Because if overprescribing to patients, including those that didn’t need anything nearly as powerful as Oxycontin, street dealers were able to wholesale it with ease. I was a part of the scene genius. I know 16 people who overdosed on Fentayl(as you said)who all started using Oxy Contin first. You sound like a Holocaust denier, only in relation to the opioid epidemic. It’s clear you either were t part of that scene or actually worked for Perdue. What do you actually know of street level use through out the entire 2000s of Oxyconting? It’s also admitted in the lawsuit that the level of OxyContin prescribed far outweighed any other RX opioid in the history of their prescriptions. Addicts are responsible ultimately for their own actions. I’ve OD’d twice and I don’t blame anyone but myself. But I was aware of the risk going in. A lot of kids much younger than me weren’t. For you to try and take any responsibility away from the maker of said drug and their attempts to have it over prescribed to make money, knowing it’s potential addiction just speaks more to your lack of morality than anything.

He had a post op infection and it took months for him to be able to fully use his leg again. We spent an extra thousand dollars on rehab for him (it was so worth it, really fun and he would not have progressed the same way without it), and I actually had to take 2 weeks off work because he needed medication throughout the day and extra attention/exercises.  The second time was my corgi, she was about four, we adopted her with the injury so I have no idea how long she had been living with it. She healed incredibly fast, and was putting full weight on her leg within a few weeks.   

 Both dogs were complete babies the first few days/nights. I made a bed in the living room on the floor so I could be with them. The medication can make them a bit loopy, and if you can I would use a donut or fabric cone so they can lay down more comfortably. My corgi cried and shook in waves for about 24 hours after we brought her home. She was on percocet, fentanol and metacam.

Yeah, because schools run on sunlight and paper, not on able bodied people and cars.

This is a dumb chicken and egg question that anyone should know the answer to. Why do those places have more police? Is it just some police religion that we have? Or is it because of violence? Is the black homicide rate fake? Is it a police hoax? Are the bodies fake? Why are black people calling the police so much?

Guys like George Floyd walk around with a lethal dose of drugs and have to be arrested. We agree with that, right? We can't have a guy walking around with a lethal dose of fetanyl shirtless where our children might be. So police arrest the guy, and they arrests these guys hundreds, thousands of times, with no deaths. But in those thousands of times there's going to be some point where the police officers just plainly fuck up and push the guy who already had one foot on the grave to die. 

Is that really a police problem? Wouldn't it be better to just not have some shirtless guy taking lethal doses of drugs and walking around the street? Wouldn't it be better if people didn't give each other lethal amounts of drugs then a fake bill to buy more cigarettes for them? Wouldn't it be better to just have less violence and less murderers?

I also got a script for 100x2,5mg Lorazepam cause I had such extreme anxiety the whole day and also had about 2-5 anxiety attacks cause I got a trauma from finding my dad after he killed himself. I used all the Tilidin in 4 month and also found 300x200mg Tramadol. After all pills were gone I started using oxycodon for 1-2 weeks always the 80mg pills, one pill was 15€. Then I found a guy who sold his Methadon pills so I paid for a blister (10 pills) of 60mg Methadon about 50€, I used the Methadon for another 2 month using a blister at first for 2 weeks and at the end I used a blister in 5 days. Then it got too expensive and I started using Heroin untill now, about 5 years now.

1. The income of municipalities comes from property taxes, denser cities will lower the value of property in cities. Sprawl is very good for keeping the value of housing close to cities artificially extremely high due to scarcity, so doing this requires a massive change in how municipalities are allowed to collect income.

2. I assume constructing buildings which are R2000 compliment  is more expensive than not meaning that mandating it is effectively a tax on construction  companies. Higher taxes on construction means less supply of construction  which is a massive impact on the economy.

3. Same as above. Lower supply of cars means car manufacturers loose out on profit which directly lowers GDP. 


Again I'm in favor of all of your suggestions. I'm tired of hearing that saving our environment has to be done without an economic impact,  of fucking course it will. We're a fucking frozen petrostate The idea that we can get to net zero emissions without any negative economic impact is about as realistic as suggesting a heroin addict can quit herioin without any withdrawals. 

Like, we already fucked up by destroying the environment. We're the state equivalent of having an incredibly self destructive serious drug addiction.

His family was greeting the mourners and while most of them were composed, his twin sister was beside herself. Through heavy tears I remember her saying to me, ""It's not fair, I'm alone now. We came into the world together and now I'm alone."" He was 21. Fuck heroin, fuck fetanyl, fuck oxys. 

&amp;#x200B;

My twin texted me saying he was feeling sick recently. After going over and talking to him he told me that he had been taking a growing amount painkillers for weeks and had recently stopped and that might be why he was feeling that way.  I think the initial withdrawal effects scared him enough to not want to touch the stuff anymore.

We worked out a plan to taper off. I was honest about how shitty he was gonna feel and he accepted it. I took the excess oxys he had and gave a few to his roommate who I trusted to dose out accordingly. I really didn't know that your body can become so dependent on opioids so quickly. He said it had only been 2-3 weeks.   


I think the first thing you should do is to figure out if your sister actually wants to quit. You can't do much if she doesn't actually want help. If that is the case, and she doesn't seen like she wants to quit, then I think you can work on convincing her otherwise. Let her know that she doesn't have to feel so shitty all the time and that getting help is possible. Also, remind her that she's likely going to die if she doesn't get help.

And it's sometimes hard to distinguish anymore who's doing either because it can be hidden from everyone for awhile, until things like this unfortunately happen. I've been clean for going on seven years now and sometimes wonder how it was that I never overdosed with all the dope I used to do. My main drug of choice was Dilaudid via intravenous use and if I had 5 pills, I was going to do those 5 pills. If I had 10, I was going to do 10 of them in a day's time. I used for 15 or more years and I was always a worry on my parents and my brother  always worrying about coming home one day and finding me dead from overdosing. Today, I'm still dealing with the fallout from my past use with health issues. Like currently in treatment for the Hep C I contracted while using opioid drugs IV. Anyway, don't be too hard on yourself, you did the best you could given the situation and at least you know CPR and was able to do something and you saved his life. From one recovering addict to apparently another (your brother) I hope this serves as a wake up call to your brother and he seeks the help he needs. As for never doing things with your brother and feeling bad about it, me and my younger brother were the same way. I don't know what advice to give on this issue.",1
574,2020-06-05 13:27:04+00:00,"Can confirm. I've been on dilaudid for breakthrough for 9 years- I take between 4-16mg a day, and it has absolutely no psychoactive effects, nor any physical side effects either. Literally the only thing it does, is lower breakthrough pain when my long acting 12-hour drug isn't enough on it's own. It's also helpful because if I sleep through my 12 hour dose, it takes a long time to get back in my system- so I could conceivably wake up feeling like the beginning of withdrawl every morning. With the dilaudid, I only have to suffer for about 3-5 minutes before it starts to break down in my stomach and stops the worst of the yawning, sweating and nausea. 

I do recall that first iv shot of dilaudid back when I had intestinal tearing and had never had an opiod in my life. That warm, pleasent feeling that washed over me. That literally never happened again a second time, even though Ive since had multiple surgeries and hospitalizations before I was put on the dilaudid long term. Even if I was months or years between any kind of opiods- i literally never again felt any physical effects from any opiod, even when I was given a large dose of fentynyl for post-surgical pain relief after a spinal surgery; absolutely nothing. It did stop the worst of the pain- but I was speaking clearly to nurses, and requesting a sandwich (it had been A REALLY long time since I'd eaten and as soon as my #1 priority wasn't pain- I was STARVING).",1

For sure. let's do our best to find out exactly what happened.

&gt; And stop trying so hard to defend a murderer.

Now here’s where you lose me. Does it seem reasonable for you to think that Chauvin *deliberately, knowingly, and in a premediated fashion* attempted to kill George Floyd? I haven’t seen any evidence to suggest that at all. Negligent homicide? Yeah, I think there’s a conversation there, and I’d be happy to talk about it with you.

&gt; The direct cause of death was ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restrain, and neck compression,"" based on the official autopsy report which you would most probably believe over the independent autopsy report which said asphyxia was the cause of death.

So a guy who had a lethal dose of fentanyl in his system, coupled with a severe heart condition, who just smoked a bowl of meth got into a fight and had a heart attack? Let's say you have a congenital heart defect that you're completely unaware of. One day, an old friend spots you and shouts, ""Hey, 08148; how the hell have you been, brother!,"" and your heart goes into fibrillation and you die as a result. Yes, your friend directly contributed to your death. Should your friend be held culpable for murder? 

&gt;  “The Conscious Neck Restraint may be used against a subject who is actively resisting. (04/16/12) On a subject who is exhibiting active aggression. 

&gt; A response to police efforts to bring a person into custody or control for detainment or arrest. A subject engages in active resistance when engaging in physical actions (or verbal behavior reflecting an intention) to make it more difficult for officers to achieve actual physical control.

Any suspect who is not complying is resisting and is acting aggressively. Loose guidelines, for sure, but murder?

&gt; So you tell me that George Floyd who was already handcuffed and lying face down on the ground with four cops around him is exhibiting active aggression or resistance? 

Yes. Restrain that person as best as you can for their safety and for yours. I know this probably won't mean much to you, but I've been a paramedic for seven years working very closely with police in a small town with very high drug traffic. Guys who are methed out or on pcp can do some pretty unbelievable things if you give them the wiggle room, even when they're in handcuffs. 

&gt; It’s not abt the fetanyl lvl that warrants a lighter treatment during arrest.

That's my point, man. You have to treat every suspect that's resisting the same. To me, excessive force in this situation would mean beating the shit out of the dude while he was laying there. What the cops were doing was making sure he wasn't thrashing until the paramedics got there. Is that so unreasonable?

Before this goes any further, I just want to say that I appreciate that you're willing to have a civil conversation about this with me. I know you're hot about all this; so am I. I just need you to know that I'm coming to the table here in good faith, and I'm grateful that you're willing to do the same.",1

With the systemic forms of scleroderma usually a patient is on a systemic drug like methotextrate or cellcept. Theres harder hitting things to like chemo and infusions. I personally have scleroderma subtype localized subtype morphea with not idea currently on my subtype of morphea. I presented weirdly so I educated myself on alot of forms of the disease. Since it was likely I had diffuse systemic when I was starting my diagnosis journey.  I am also on hydroxychlorquine for the left over joint pain that returned the day before my methotextrate shots. As well as D3 2000UI since i sit at the lower level. I also recommend the facebook support groups. Ones called scleroderma and ones called the scleroderma support group. Hydroxychlorquine is actually one of the milder treatments for this disease for the systemic form. However some people get treated with high dose D3 and phototherapy as the lighter forms on the body.,1

My OB was also thinking she was going to be 8lbs which is a large baby compared to both my husband and I's birth weight. I did my research and found that there is a small percentage dip in C Sections if induced before 40 weeks so I talked to my OB and pulled the trigger.
I first got a membrane sweep on 5/21 which didn't seem to do anything but I was about .5 cm dilatedat that point.  Late on 5/22, I got a foley inserted to help with dilation. It didn't hurt but I forwent my usual neighborhood walk since I wasn't in the mood with a giant tube coming out of my bits. I did feel some cervical pressure but never passed the Foley while at home.
I had an appointment with L&amp;D to come in late 5/23 and we got all checked in. First, they were able to pull out the first Foley after a little tug (something I was NOT going to try at home). They then inserted a larger Foley and let it do it's thing for a two hours. This came out with another gentle tug and I was officially at 4.5 cm. 
Now I got an IV of pitocin which several friends said gave them horrible contractions. The first few hours (now around midnight) weren't that bad but things started getting into pure pain territory around 3am. By 5:30, I was having horrible contractions every minute for about 30 seconds. At this point I waved the white flag and asked the nurse for an epidural. First she asked if I wanted to try a shot of something. Something turned out to be fentinyl and all it did was make me feel dizzy with no pain improvement. On to the epidural!
Epidural was great and I instantly passed out for about 4 hours having been up all night and barely sleeping the night before that. They increased the petocin and I responded well. I wasn't sure if I was going to go for it but at that point I knew I wouldn't have the energy to push if I didn't get some rest. 
Finally around 3:30pm on 5/24 it was time to start pushing as my water had broken sometime before that but I didn't feel it. We had to use the monitor to see that I was having a contraction for each push initially, but they turned off the epidural at that point. Two and a half hours of pushing later, our LO was born and placed on my chest. I could feel the tearing but it really didn't hurt as much. Dad cut the cord and all was good. 
One thing I want to pass on: breastfeeding, which thankfully came easy, causes your uterus to contract to get back to it's normal size. No one warned me how much this would hurt though. My nipples didn't have an issue, but the cramps were crazy! Take some Tylenol before BF after the first day to save yourself some major pain.",1

Where might one find his criminal records during those combined years, totalling 18 years or so.  Sounds like fuzzy math, sorry.  Also, does anyone know what the crimes on this list mean?

duration is one of this chems biggest cons, i was only able discern any effects within a period of 2 hours, with a fairly steep drop of effects around the 1 hour mark, very moreish stuff. 

the high is great though, very clean and euphoric. its especially heady compared to say, morphine or hydro/codone/morphone, there is still a definite morphinan warm blanket effect but the bodyload is light and the mental euphoria is more focused. comparable to low dose oxycodone in a way.

That is certainly going to be a factor.  But it is not conclusive of anything.  What were they waiting for?  Why did it go on for 8 minutes?  Was there some justification?  Were they waiting for the ambulance due to him being under the influence of something (which we now know was fentnyl and that he had used meth ""recently"" but the cops didn't know what)?  Or was the ambulance only called after he was non-responsive.  I think it must have been before as Chauvin is still on him when the ambulance rolls up.

Is it within training/protocol to stay on someone until the ambulance arrives and the person can be strapped into the gurney?

If it was protocol to continue restraint until the ambulance arrives and they can restrain the suspect on the gurney then the length of time is not, by itself, unreasonable.  

On the surface the 8 minutes looks very bad, but it may not be what it seems.  The above questions, and more, need to be answered before a conclusion can be made and charges levied.

It does not look good for the other three, but we shouldn't charge nor convict based on appearances.  

To be clear, I am NOT saying these officers are without culpability.  I'm saying we need to understand what culpability, if any, they have.  I think bringing charges only to have them dismissed, or have the officers acquitted, could be worse than explaining why they're not being charged (if that's the decision).  If charges are brought, they need to stick.",2

BUT we got an honest coroner for the autopsy on this one so they didn't omit that the cardiac arrest was brought on by [I forgot the specific term they used for choking] which added just enough strain on his heart and declared it a death by homicide. A coroner's report can carry alot of weight. If this wouldn't have been blown up, there wouldn't have been as much attention so the cop would have less resources available to him(full attention of police unions, hyper right wing lawyers).

Holding someone down on the ground is not a crime.  It is not even cruel.  If I was a cop, I would be incredibly paranoid now about holding anyone down, lest they have health issues and drugs in their system that makes them more fragile and prone to injuries.

There are legitimate corruption issues within the police force.  Cops framing people, cops sodomizing a guy in custody (a few years ago in NYC).  Very well documented, very important.  A criminal druggie that dies because he has health issues is not one of those issues.",1

Well the lack of gun is a good indicator he wasn't committing armed robberies. As for the fentanyl, drug addiction is tragic but its not exactly a devastating crime. The person he was hurting the most doing drugs was himself, its a medical issue not a criminal one in my opinion.

706,2020-06-02 10:21:53+00:00,"Starting about 20 years ago a subset of doctors realized that they could prescribe opioids for, well, everything.  Did you pull your back?  Were you in a minor car accident?  Did you fall and bruise up your knee?  All of those injuries are extremely minor and can be treated without any pain medication.  At most you might need some Tylenol.  

But if someone showed up in your office and asked for pain pills then you, as a doctor, could lawfully prescribe *anything that was FDA approved for the treatment of pain*.  This includes opioids.  The crazy thing about opioids is they're functionally the same as heroin.  They're not just similar.  They are a literal reformulation of heroin.  Heroin, Norco, and Oxycotin are all functionally identical and 100% interchangeable so long as you adjust the dosage to account for differences in potency.

And it wasn't just doctors that began realizing they could do this - people who were looking to get heroin realized it as well.  This resulted in the formation of what are known as ""pill mills"" - doctors that would prescribed opioids to anyone who asked for them, essentially becoming legal heroin dealers.  

The picture of a pill mill that most people have is some seedy doctor operating out of the back of a strip mall somewhere - or at the very least a private doctor who wasn't affiliate with a major medical provider.  But the reality is that pill mill doctors were everywhere.  No one was doing any oversight of them and so even big HMOs with a good reputation - like Kaiser Permanente on the west coast - were filled with them.

Starting in 2014 the DEA and FDA issued new rules about opioid prescriptions that were intended to shut down pill mills.  They also started going after HMOs and other insurance affiliated medical groups for pill mill doctors that were hiding within those organizations.

The result of this crackdown is that HMOs and insurance affiliated medical groups do not allow normal doctors to prescribe opioids anymore.  They can write out an opioid prescription, but the prescription has to be reviewed and approved by a special pain management specialist - sometimes this person is a pharmacist, sometimes this person is another doctor.

The pain management specialist's job is to make sure that the opioid is only being prescribed due to a serious injury or condition and that the opioid is only going to be used for a short, fixed period of time after which cessation is mandatory in all but the most extreme cases (IE, for pain associated with terminal cancer).",1

I tired to warn everyone last week that the Hennepin County DA, Mike Freeman was corrupt on other threads. I got downvoted to oblivion. Then everyone realized that was true.

When the initial M.E.'s autopsy findings came out, I tried to warn everyone that the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, despite his so-called impressive resume, is even dirtier. He did the same thing in the Philando Castile case. I got downvoted even MORE into oblivion.

Look everyone, it's clear. The fix is in.

They are determined to get Chauvin off. Everything they have claimed is to justify that. They did not even want to arrest him and the public got hip. They charged him with 3rd degree in the hope he would get bail.

Moreover, 3rd degree is important not just because it is an undercharging but also without any hint of intent, they thought Chauvin's lawyer would actually get him off for that because a jury might well find intent.

The public did not go for that and demanded a higher charge. Now they're coming back with this bogus toxicology report (just like they did in the Philando Castile case) so that 2nd degree will not stick either.

The Hennepin County DA and Medical Examiner have made it extremely difficult legally, to convict Chauvin of 2nd or 3rd degree murder. They are trying to get it so that, at worse, manslaughter is the only charge that will stick. And I don't put it past them to try to find a way to make that charge difficult as well at this rate.",2

That will be $1500, I am a specialist, after all..."" Fire this guy like he was already loaded in to a cannon. I wouldnt let him within 1000 feet of your dad.

Keep in mind what equianalgesic tables and calculators are really about, they arent rigid dose conversions between drugs, they are approximate equivalencies to prevent overdose, not therapeutic efficacy. We all know somebody that got better results from a weaker drug than a stronger one at a supposed equivalent or *higher* dose.

You need to get your dad some alternate doctors. If this oncologist or anaesthesiologist or whatever they are are so afraid of drugs with a 6000 year history of proven success against pain, they cant be depended upon to do what is best for the patient, they will do what is best for themselves. That is pretty evident. If anything (God forbid) goes wrong in the surgery, he's already lined up a scapegoat. A history of drug abuse. My last surgeon (removed a tumor that had penetrated the dura, so it was no little thing) had about 4 words about my medication. That was not his thing, his thing was cutting out the tumor. The anaesthesiology team and I talked about 5 minutes before they wheeled me in to the OR. It pretty much went like: ""this is what I am taking, don't put me in withdrawal, and we'll see how the pain is when I wake up, okay?"" The pre op physical went sort of the same way. ""dont need a taper, what I need is not to be put in to withdrawal because someone is afraid to prescribe my regular meds."" 

What they are asking your dad to do is BS. They dont wait for someone to taper while their appendix is going to burst. There is a single surgical complication from opioids, it has to do with anaesthesia. There are different levels of anaesthesia, the deepest of which, used for most hospital type procedures is general anaesthesia. This messes with your body's reflexes, stuff like breathing that happens without thinking about it. Opioids also depress this breathing reflex, so it increases the odds of respiratory arrest. Just like the anaesthesia drugs can cause, which is why, when they take you that kind of deep, they put you on a ventilator anyhow, or they have one ready to go in an instant, so you dont miss a breath. Now the problem with a machine doing that hard breathing work for you (and if you have even seen someone on a vent, its a terrible sight, you can see their whole body shake as the machine breathes for them) and the body can get used to it quickly and refuse to breathe on its own when they turn the vent down. That's why general anaesthesia is such a huge risk and you have to sign all kinds of releases. It can happen whether you are on opioids or not, it doesnt matter, only as a scapegoat.

Your dads in a tough spot, as are you. You may have bad times ahead where you are torturing yourself that you could have done more or better for him. Dont fall for that, its part of grief. Youre doing a great job looking out for your dad in the face of a great deal of ignorance and those lacking common sense empathy. You fighting with people who think its okay to put a knee on someones neck for 10 minutes. I may not know the right way to fight that kind of uncaring stupidity, but I know accepting it as just the way it goes is dead wrong. You're fighting that sort of loss of human empathy the best you can and whatever happens, your dad is better off for it. Hang in there...

Oh btw...I am pretty sure you can not cut any long acting med without affecting the medication release. It can dose dump, so tread that path carefully. If the freaking dose was actually as big a deal as they re making it out to be, they'd be giving him a months worth of 10mg MSContin and telling to take no more than 16 tablets a day. Or 3x 50mg. But they are **SO** concerned about the issue, the did what? It would be funny if it wasnt so serious...",1

What would make me happy ?

Friends - involves maybe meeting someone online via social media or at a work place

A job i like and enjoy and can manage the tasks at hand, both mentally and physically. And also maintain the shifts. - will require alot of applying and may have to come down to finding someone to befriend to get a job somehwere. Not to mention also risking going into a job where the boss or a work colleague could be an asshole or very strict etc or even no sense of humor or sense of being able to have some type of enjoyment whilst at work. 

My own place ( somewhere i can have a partner ) - yet you will always most likely have to pay - rent or a mortgage, land rates , electricity , water , gas ( if applicable ) , phone bills , internet , pet maintenance ( if applicable ) , child / kids maintenance or support ( if applicable ) home and or contents insurance , car insurance , car rego , car greenslip , fuel etc.

A fit physique - yet will require exercise and eating healthy. 

Better control of my mental health - will require on going trips to my GP and regular psych visits ( calls currently ) and medication 

Maybe travel - will be very expensive but then will be rewarding if you go places that interest you and are worth the money and the hours of flights and travel and also the stuff in between. 

Atleast i made it 29 years 

As a reminder i have no friends and only my nan and mother ( who lives away somehere as she doesn't care about me ) my nan also has mental health issues very bad. 

Also seen many psychologists and psychiatrists and been on multiple medications and also contacted all the crises lines and they are about as useful a car with no wheels. 

So what do i do keep getting my meds reviewed year after year ? 

Keep trying to push myself to exercise even though ive already been there done that with 2 weightloss transformations of 18kgs and 32kgs. ( before i was on heavy meds ) 

Stay for my nan 

The only time I'm happy is when im unconscious ( asleep ) 

Or eating 

I know i have no right to complain living in a 1st world county away from poverty and war and violence etc. 

Also not being so unwell i need life support or regular hospital visits 

Some might say having a near death experience changed their life.

I have had one of these which introduced a brain injury back in 2003 which introduced more of these mental health problems and also increased the severity of the  existing ones. 

Maybe i watch too many movies and lose myself in a fantasy all the time asking myself what if I could really live like that. 

Most people know movies are never real even the ones based on a true story etc are mostly made up to create more drama or excitement etc 

Are we all like ants ? Having to follow laws and rules and do what society and our superiors expect of us ?

What if we chose to live somewhere remote and start a new life all together ? A place near fresh water and a land with sufficient sun and rain to sustain organic crops and maybe a farm and use solar energy as power and maybe start a little village away from social media , tv and radio. 

Some would argue what about education and health care etc what if we learnt to teach and look after our own health with natures fruits and vegetables and plants etc.

I know as someone living on less then a third of the average wage. If i were to win a million dollars etc i would be very happy i mean who wouldnt yes the money wouldn't last long and you would be some or most of the things you have always wanted but then what?

Your back to square one only this time you realize you have just wasted so much money. 

Also people say to volunteer etc as helping others makes you feel better. Ive also been there done that and ended up being over used for my help and labour then i was shown gratitude and appreciation. And also being threatened at times as if i was getting paid. And trust me aint nothing better then walking out on a place that treat you right aswell as not pay you a cent. 

Ao i guess to some up what would truly make my life worth it and make me happy is a job / career i enjoy and atleast it will bring in an income each week or fortnight that i can live on comfortably not one big lump sum i would be tempted to spend all at once. Also doing what i am passionate about and maybe work with a team of people that share that same passion. Maybe travel as part of my job and meet new people and make new friends also being able to afford a place of my own. 

But thats all easier said then done. And how many of us live that life ? Im assuming probably less then 1 percent of the population 

And what would it take to get there ? A uni / college degree ?

Getting back into the workforce and working for dome crappy place doing some crappy job day in and day out for weeks or months or years. 

Yes i can hear those saying well negativity doesnt get you far and its all about being positive etc. Yatta yatta 

But i do not choose to be negative its just a side affect of my life events and also my mental health. 

I mean I'm happy for those that can channel all this mindfulness and positivity etc. 

Good for them. 

The only drug i have ever been on that has made me feel happy and express lots of love etc is endone ( oxycotin ) which was when i had my appendix removed in 2015 which was not long before i lost the love of my life. And also screwed over by my father. 

Sometimes i wish i was smarter or less intelligent / knowledgeable. 

I wish i could just be happy with the simple things and be happy with the 'conveyer system' i like to call it. And just go to school get a job get my own place find a partner get married have kids grow old and die. Wow is that all life is ?

I just feel like sometimes being rescued by someone who can teach me their ways or someone i can work for in return of a better life.

Sounds like a good candidate for those recruited in those places / organizations for the wrong reasons. 

I would never brain washed into all that crap. 

I'm ok with people and the world aslong as i have my space and they leave me alone. 

I guess i can expect people say "" you can't expect anything to happen if you dont put yourself out there or try hard enough "" 

This is true. I mean im putting myself ' out there ' now by writing all this. 

Who knows will anyone have the time to read such an amount of text in their spare time?

Let alone write back their answers or response ?

I used to search the web on things such as what are the happiest countries in the world and places with the lowest depression and suicide rates and least crime etc what do these places have in common ? 

Is it the people ? The nutrition in their foods ? The water purity ? The healthcare system ? The laws and rules ? The technology ? The jobs available ? Or the variety of them ? The income ? The lack of poverty ? Their lifestyles? More sun ? More social connection? Lack of violence ?

Some used to say i also needed structure and routine in my life. 

Things i used to have when i thought i had it all. 

Its amazing when you take a jigsaw apart piece by piece you cant really make out what the picture is anymore. Or why piecing it together in the first place was worth it.


What would be a dream job for me i dunno i love cars , but the whole modifying scence is dead and dying and one day it will all be electric cars. 

I like movies and always wondered what it would be like to be an actor and meet other great actors. Then you have the cons of long hours and hard work and paparazzi and being stalked your life and possibly being scammed into some payout for something you never did. 

Always been into ancient places and sites and wondered what it would be like to discover things or places never discovered before even travel to the deepest parts of the ocean. 

I mean yeah space is cool and all however it isnt really life sustainable at the moment and not really much to do or discover up on the moon that hasnt been discovered. 

We are all going to die someday why not die doing something you love / enjoy doing.

Most people drink alcohol wether it be at pub or at home - i don't drink 

Go to the gym and exercise to maintain that fit physique and get that endorphin release. - cost money - and also hard to find a day or time and a gym when hardly anyone is there and also to match it when I am mentally able to go. 

Or watch TV / movies - I do this quite often 

Go online talk with friends or family if you have any. 

Or maybe look after kids and or animals ( pets ) - i don't have any kids or pets  

Or clean and cook and washing and washing up etc. -  I dont clean or cook or do any washing 

Play some sport -  i hate all sports 

Play video games - i don't play any due to not finding them stimulating enough

Go for a walk or a jog around the block or a bike ride ( cycling ) - i don't as it doesnt inerest me anymore as well as not having anywhere within 10 - 15 mins thats exciting to go walking 

Play a musical instrument - I dont have the patience to learn 

Restore something - cost money and also will lose motivation along the way and most probably money 

House renovations - I dont own a homeand also wouldn't be bothered at this stage

Read a book -  I've never read a book in my life

Write - well i guess im doing that now and do it sometimes 

Draw / paint - I've totally lost all interest 

Dance class - never ever will do this 

Yoga - never done it 

Fishing - i hate it unless i have someone to go with 

Building something - what to build ? And why ? And probably costs money

722,2020-06-01 14:28:45+00:00,"Hi there, 

I know I'm late to the tread, but my mom has been dealing with bile duct cancer since February 2018.  She was complaining of pain for months before her insurance finally approved a scan.  They discovered a 9cm malignant tumor nestled near blood vessels in the middle of the liver.  She was treated with  cisplatin and gemcitabine for about 9 months.  She showed minimal shrinkage of the tumor, but no growth.  We are at the Buffet Cancer Center in Omaha, Ne.  We did get a second opinion at Mayo.  The prognosis and treatment were the same.  They said patients with this cancer generally live about a year after diagnosis.  I believe my mom has a slow growing version of the cancer. 

In October of 2018, so went through targeted radiation until December.  They saw some changes in the tumor, but not much shrinkage.  She did not receive any treatment for about 9 months.  She had labs and scans every month to keep an eye on things.  In October of 2019 she started having a lot more pain.  A new scan showed two new small tumors in her liver.  Her oncologist wanted to change up chemos since these new tumors seemed to be faster growing.  At this point mom was taking oxycodone daily.  She was hesitant at first, but advice is to make sure you are treating the pain before it gets bad.  Get on a schedule and stay on top of it.  

The new chemo included infusions every 3 weeks, but 5x a day chemo pills.  I believe they were called Xeloda? She had a very sharp decline once she started this treatment.  In the past month she has had to go in to the hospital 3 times to get fluid drained from her abdomen.  She had a drainage port placed a little over a week ago.  We are draining a liter or more of fluid every other day.  She was upgraded to a long acting Oxycotin.  When she started taking this, she was unable to sleep.  The insomnia caused an even swifter decline.  She was hospitalized from Wednesday to Saturday and came home Saturday night (today is Monday).  They switched her to morphine pills and she is able to sleep now.  She is also on Clonazepam to help with sleep.  

We are meeting with hospice today.  She was always a ""quantity over quality"" when talking about her life.  She wanted more time.  I gave birth to her first and only grandchild in August and she always was pushing for more time.  She has now reached the point where she is in too much pain and discomfort.  

I don't know why I wrote this whole thing.  I didn't really answer any of your questions.  I'm an only child and I know my dad is burnt out so I guess I wanted somewhere to talk about this.  

To my knowledge, they always do chemo first to make sure any small tumors (too small to see on a scan) are wiped out before they try to surgically remove the tumor.  This was never an option for my mom due to the placement.  Ask about radiation, ask about gene therapy.  We were exploring this before she took this sharp decline.  Really evaluate quality of life.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.
