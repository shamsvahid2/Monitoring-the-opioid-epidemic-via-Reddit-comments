34,2021-07-30 11:59:58+00:00,I agree with legalizing drugs but what do you do when your legal dose of opioids costs $20 and an illegal dose of fentanal still costs like 2 cents? It seems like you would need to also subsidize it in order to have any beneficial effect on the lives of the most vulnerable addicts.,1
35,2021-07-30 11:13:18+00:00,"Yeah I'm sure it would help especially with side effects and keeping her appetite up. Though I would suggest convincing her to try different opioids until something works well because that's most likely going to be what gives her the most quality of life back. And while I have heard of a few people that Lyrica or gabapentin were life-saving for all they did was make me a damn zombie and cause permanent memory loss and brain damage. I was forced on to them first in the super high doses as they only mode of pain control and then again at low dose to supplement my opioid because basically it was take both and show them on your drug tests or get neither and be kicked out of pain management so I did that right up until I realized 2 hours after taking every dose I was becoming suicidal for 12 hours or more feeling completely hopeless and despair which wasn't exactly irrational but that reminds me I was also developing a rational beliefs that facts couldn't change and manic and yeah those things are more like chemical lobotomies for a lot of people. And if she wasn't getting good pain relief from an opioid or they were making her sleepy before giving her pain control I would wager a guest that they had her on the super expensive still patented crap opioids that they're pushing on people now like nucynta or tramadol or something with partial opioid blocker. something of that nature.  Morphene maybe, vicodin would be something id get her to try though oxycodone would be my first choice, those two are typically less a downer at least for me. Only thing that gives me any quality of life is oxy.  Beware extended release though. They drive up tolerance and dont last the 12 hours theyre claimed to once youve been on em a few months. End up in a viscous cycle of pain/withdrawal and relief and runs the tolerance up faaast due to that and the want to take early causing higher than normal levels.  Hell if the lowest dose, 5mg is too much then half them. I went years just using 2.5 til surgeries upped my tolerance and my condition worsened.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

45,2021-07-30 03:07:06+00:00,"Yo I switched from 10mg Norco 4x/day to 15mg MSContin 3x/day a while back.

For me, the morphine works much better when it comes to pain, but the hydrocodone is more euphoric. If you're asking as far as a high goes, I'd personally say the hydro is slightly stronger - but it also doesn't last as long. I have to crush/chew up the morphine to actually feel anything.

Morphine has a huge bioavailability range, so it may affect you more or less than others.",1
46,2021-07-30 02:12:23+00:00,"1mg of morphine oral equals 1mg of hydrocodone oral.  if taken orally, they're equivalent. 

but ms contin er lasts 8-12ish hours and norco lasts like 4.  so u need to compare yr total daily doses, not the amount per dose.  

so if yr taking 15mg ms contin twice a day, that's a total daily dose of 30 mme.

so it's equivalent to taking 3 10mg norcos a day.  but prolly more consistent.  it's a steady, low background level of opiates 24 7 instead of 3 bursts of opiates that wear off.

if u were taking more than 3 norcos a day,then the switch to mscontin is a dose reduction.",1

92,2021-07-27 22:45:12+00:00,"&gt;Never thought I would post on here but I see alot of feedback in a short amount of time and I'm in dire need. Had a bad H addiction with F and it started with real oxys (that withdrawal I could handle plus couldn't get them as often as we wanted) so they the Blue 30s came and I always suspected they were fetanyl which I now know for sure. Anyway once those started and we could literally get those everyday whenever we wanted they were cool but the withdrawal was just totally different and way more severe to the point I couldn't handle it. As it goes for everyone I started sniffing the pills then onto H never was an IV user. I started experimenting with pills when I got on 3 year misdemeanor probation because my whole life i never even gave any pill or anything other then weed a try.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Not even cigarettes but since people would say this can leave my system in 3 days instead of the 30 with pot I figured what bad could come from it I won't get addicted. So long story short I got on methadone but continued to use for about a year. March 25th I went to jail for 12 days and cold turkey in a jail cell (Covid restrictions 14 day initial lock in). On day 13 I left to a court ordered rehab and came home after 28 days wasnt long before I was back thinking i knew about withdrawal and would stop before it would happen.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I never knew what came with this stuff when I first started. Medical detox I cant sit there and wait to be sick I dont know why I dont wanna be on suboxone or anything but at this point I absconded from probation now have a warrant but the court peer advisor tells me if I go to detox or come in clean then maybe I can avoid the whole jail thing. I'll do my 4 months in jail but I fear like nothing I ever feared before the withdrawal in a jail cell. If I could just do it at home and have my TV and Dog and Fridge and even just a phone in my hand to take my mind off it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I dont know what to do I feel like jail is the only thing that can stop me but maybe if I taper down to .2 a day the withdrawal will be bearable. And I dont know If I want to be clean yet I still enjoy getting high even though its ripping my life apart. I'm 20 and it's just so much between my family legals and myself seeing myself deteriorate but I want to go cold turkey so any advice for that is what I'm looking for but I'm open to any solutions.

122,2021-07-26 16:32:09+00:00,"I have really good luck with the taper method to stop taking kratom.
Booze and weed didn't work for me at all. Wound up using both every day after work for 6 months or so.
My kratom use was for back pain.. oxy wasn't an option anymore as my doses were getting bigger and more frequent. 
The withdrawals from any opioid isn't a joke. It sucks. Kratom completely put the withdrawals from oxy's out.
Use a few after surgery still here and there.
Even after 3 surgeries still having terrible pain. Sweating and have passed out from pain several times.
Lately have been feeling better thankfully. 
Kratom helps immensely, but I've found less is better. Took awhile for me to figure that out.
My habit did get up to 30 grams/day.. taking for almost 4 years.
But I felt awful at higher doses of it. 
Using 10 caps at a time, twice a day helps dull the pain.
Stopping was hard at first, but I found staying under 2 doses of 10 caps daily keeps withdrawals very manageable. Kept the doses at 12 hour intervals. So basically 5 grams twice a day.
At higher doses the withdrawals were pretty intense for me.
Enough so I learned to keep doses low, and at 12 hours.
Tramadol withdrawals were the worst I've ever experienced, Kratom can be pretty bad as well... seems the psychotropic qualities adds more discomfort when going CT. Anxiety and depression are part of the WD.
A taper of a 1/2 gram every other day was my technique  until it was comfortable to go 12 hours without dosing.
Now I go weeks between using kratom. Only using when having a flairup. 
The anxiety and depression of cold turkey when taking high doses frequently broke my will to stop..
It's hard to stop when withdrawals are bad enough to drive one into getting right back on whatever it is. That's a big part of not being able to stop.
Most of us just can't take it and just dose to get normal. 
If one has to stop totally...
Cut doses as small as possible. Makes a big difference in success, takes some willpower and dedication for sure.
My stepson is addicted to heroin and fentenyl, there is no description for the hell he goes through when withdrawals hit him. He can't stop when it gets like that.
So bad... he can't stop unless he's locked up. Addiction is a terrible thing for people. 
I'm not endorsing kratom use at all.
But the big thing for me is, less is better. Easier said than done I know.
Staying as busy as possible during the quitting process is very important. 
Water and a good diet helps too.
With me I found that mentally the withdrawals were worse if I thought about it, or worried about how bad will it actually get.
Lower doses seemed to be the trick, and realizing not everyone is capable of tapering my advice is it does get better with time when stopping. 
It can be done. I've been going on 3 weeks kratom free at present.
Have a bag of red vien caps in the dresser. Reality is have I actually stopped?
No... it's there if I want it. And that's certainly not really stopping.
Haven't really had any withdrawals this time. I do have Lyrica.. and have used some here and there at night.
Gabapentin helps wd's too.
But like anything. 
They can become an issue as well. And my advice would be not to use it to put the wd fire out.

This forum is very good on Kratom addiction issues. Very supportive folks and it helped me alot in finding the answer I needed for myself.
Which is tapering.. being honest with yourself about why you take it is also key.
Lower doses are easier to kick for most. Finding a new hobby is very helpful. 
It does get better when detoxing.. takes awhile and is different for everyone. 
We know in our hearts what it takes.
Just hang in there and let time heal the empty spot that the addiction caused.
May even find out the kratom isn't really ones issue, meaning we either eat because we are hungry or we eat because it helps us forget something we really should address without drugs, alcohol or over eating. 
Times for healing obviously vary..
We have to hang in there, and realize we aren't alone. There's nothing wrong with seeking help through the process. 
One will know when they are ready to move on and heal.
Takes being brave and honest to one's self and also ones loved ones.
In the end..
You got this.
6 grams/day shouldn't be horribly uncomfortable to stop, less is better if possible. 
Increasing times between dosing helps me immensely. 
Found myself forgetting to take it after awhile. 
Side effects from lower doses are much less noticeable as well.
This forum will help too. Alot of good folks on here.
Take care... God bless and good luck!!",1

What happens if you do it a few times and you notice the withdrawals come back about every 2 days? So It may be a methadone dependency now? I didn't know what to do and relapsed.

New here and sorry for long post: 

Do you know if I can reset, restart my detox using methadone if say...I became dependent on methadone because of a relapse too fast, and used methadone too much because of the relapse? 7 days within each detox? 

So I got clean, no problems. Second time... I used and repeated my detox, but barely made it as at the end... I noticed every two days (about every two days) I would start withdrawal symptoms, and I believe it is the methadone now I became addicted to. 

So I theorize if it is minor and minute... make it as long as possible, but even if I did... Near the end I used and switched back to fentanyl pills, smoking as I didn't want to use other drugs and create a general dependency, cross dependency/ addiction. So now that it has been about 4 weeks of touching any methadone and it was a minor methadone withdrawals and dependency... would that be enough time to get over the methadone and restart and be able to safely, in smaller to safer amounts and maybe 3 to 4 days maximum of using methadone to rapid taper, use methadone and detox finally and completely once and for all? No more playing around. No more relapses. 

I wanted to get through this and bought myself this much time. I am hoping 4 weeks is plenty to get the methadone out of my body and brain and reset the dependency on just the fetanyl pills and do this last detox using methadone as a rapid taper and safe way to get past the acute withdrawals as always before, but to not become dependent on methadone again and give myself time to just stick to the pills and restart everything as close to safe and minimal, as fresh and new as possible?

I'm told if given enough time...yes, it can and should work, but I want and need confirmed ideas and consensus, experiences and responses. Should I wait longer or is it about safe to do the final detox by now?",0

*In October 2020, Purdue agreed to an $8 billion settlement that includes a $2 billion criminal forfeiture, a $3.54 billion criminal fine, and $2.8 billion in damages for its civil liability.

And the past decade has highlighted the lack of any responsibility or consequences for Pharma billionaires and their dirty deeds.

From what I could find: Methylphenidate does not increase the risk of serious (life threatening) harms when used for periods of up to six months. However, taking methylphenidate is associated with an increased risk of non-serious harms such as sleeping problems and decreased appetite.

Could you cite sources for claims about altering child's brains and hearts?

&gt;Now tell me are we medicating children because they have is difference in cognition or brain structure?

Does it cause them discomfort? Does it prevent them from leading a normal life? Does it prevent them from taking care of themselves? Does it reduce their quality of life? If the questions are no. Then no, we should not use medication.

&gt;If so, I would think there are far healthier ways to combat this (Exercise, Meditation, Therapy).

Ha. As a person who suffered from chronic depression and anxiety for years, I could tell you that you really do need drugs to have your quality of life improved. Other things do jack shit. Yeah, it's depressing to think you are a salve of your brain chemistry but that's the reality.

Similarly, bad cases of ADHD require treatment to even get the person into a state where things like therapy or meditation could even begin to help.

&gt;Methylphenidate is a schedule 2 drug, which is classified on the same level as Fetanyl , Cocaine, and Morphine. Now tell me, how come a drug that's supposed to help soo much is given such high of a classification.

Because there is serious risk of addiction or substance abuse if not following the regulated dosage.

&gt;Our meta-analysis demonstrated that children/adolescents and adults treated with methylphenidate resulted in significant increases in post- vs. pre-treatment HR and SBP as compared to placebo

Yeah. Many drugs cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. Not saying it's something trivial, but if your chosen risk group is children. Then they are the least affected age group. It's the elderly, people with heart problems, and increased blood pressure that you need to watch out for.

&gt;however many children are being prescribed these medications that don't even have ""it"" or need it

Dunno. What's your definition of ""need it""? I mean in general, yeah US tends to over-medicate. But that's more broad problem than with this one specific drug to one specific age group.

&gt; Now tell me are we medicating children because they have is difference in cognition or brain structure?

Yes. If there is something wrong with someone's body, we fix it if we can. That's the whole point of medicine.

&gt; If so, I would think there are far healthier ways to combat this (Exercise, Meditation, Therapy).

Those help, but a ton of research studies have found that stimulant medicines work best.

&gt; Methylphenidate is a schedule 2 drug, which is classified on the same level as Fetanyl , Cocaine, and Morphine. Now tell me, how come a drug that's supposed to help soo much is given such high of a classification. (I understand classification is related to how controlled a substance is) 

The whole reason it's Schedule 2 instead of Schedule 1 is because it helps people with ADHD. That's the difference. Schedule 2 drugs have important medical uses. If you are hit by a truck, you want fentanyl. But it's a bad idea to take it for fun because if you take too much, you could die.

&gt; ""Our meta-analysis demonstrated that children/adolescents and adults treated with methylphenidate resulted in significant increases in post- vs. pre-treatment HR and SBP as compared to placebo""

It's a stimulant. It makes your heart beat faster and your blood pressure go up. What's wrong with that? That information alone doesn't tell you anything. When Olympic sprinters run the 100 meter dash in a few days, their heart rate and blood pressure will be elevated too. When someone is dying of heart disease, their heart rate and blood pressure is also elevated. The cardiovascular system is very complex and those two figures don't tell the full story. Resting heart rates regularly range from 60 to 100. And going higher or lower can be a sign of excellent health or death depending on the circumstances.

&gt; Schedule 2 substances have the possibility of being abused, however many children are being prescribed these medications that don't even have ""it"" or need it. How can we stop that abuse?

If you're crushing and snorting a bunch of someone else's meds before going to a party, that's abuse. If you're taking a prescribed dose, that's the polar opposite of abuse.

&gt; Granted the above was stated in the context of short term, but how is it that this risk is only present short term but not long? 

Because doctors have been prescribing them to people for years and nothing bad has happened. The dose makes the poison. Too much water or oxygen will kill you. But too little will kill you too.

These are stimulants, they crank your heart rate up and down which can't be good for you heart over long term. Maybe I am biased because I have been through this but I think we need to take a hard look at how we ""treat"" children that suffer from mental disorders.

&gt; These are stimulants, they crank your heart rate up and down which can't be good for you heart over long term. 

The whole point of cardiovascular exercise is to crank your heart rate up and down. Medications alone don't work as well as exercise, but the principle isn't bad on it's own. More importantly, your heart gets used to the level of stimulants you have in your system. So they make your heart beat fast at first, but then your heart gets used to it and doesn't beat as fast. But if you suddenly stop, your heart slows down too. But at the range of doses doctors give to people, this isn't a problem. But if you buy meth on the street, you can easily die from it.

As a last point, [here is a meta-analysis article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31135892/) about the safety of methylphenidate in children. It is published in one of the world's most prestigious medical journals, and summarizes the results of 49 other studies ranging from 1806 to 2019. They found that there has not been a single life threatening adverse event. Their conclusion is that not only are the current maximum doses of methylphenidate safe, we should consider increasing them further.",3

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.

Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

203,2021-07-22 16:50:20+00:00,"&gt;The truth about Babbitt is that she was just part of a crowd that got a bit out of control

You know that videos exist of that day, right? This is the biggest downplaying of the insurrection I've seen from someone who isn't an elected representative of Congress.

&gt;I mean, if the left tells the truth about Floyd, he's a career criminal who died of a fentanyl overdose.  


He died because a cop obstructed his airways for nearly 10 minutes. Floyd's past crimes, which he had already paid his debt to society for, had nothing to do with what he was arrested for that day, and the fenanyl in his system would not have killed him because he had built up a tolerance from years of abuse of the drug. These are facts. Were it not for Chauvin's knee on his neck, Floyd would have lived that day.

&gt;If they tell the truth about the looters and rioters who burned businesses down and led to the total disintegration of any remaining social trust between various racial groups in this country, leaving the country more fractured and weak than at any point in its history, they were intentional and organized by a number of Marxist militant groups that the Democratic leadership is in full partnership with.  


They were just part of a crowd that got a bit out of control.

See what I did there?

&gt;If they tell the truth about the election....

What do you mean drugs *poisoned* with fentanyl? Fentanyl is the drug of choice in DTES. Even the ‚Äúsafe supply‚Äù being handed out includes fentanyl. The problem of deaths comes back because of pharmacodynamic tolerance. You eventually don‚Äôt get enough from safe supply and need to go out looking for more.

O que leva algu√©m a ser fanatico por algo/algu√©m √© realmente algo de outro mundo, at√© entendo que no quesito religioso, existe a religi√£o da fragilidade, pessoas que buscam uma esperan√ßa no meu do caos do mundo, um guia, um manual de como ser feliz, sabe? E essas pessoas ficam presas ali, acreditando em tudo e defendendo o pastor/lider/padre/etc com unhas e dentes, porque muitas vezes esse lider religioso √© a unica coisa que segura o ""sonho"" de que a mensagem que ele passa seja 100% verdadeira (ai a origem da fragilidade pode ser diversa, relacionamento, morte de ente querido, dificuldade financeira, parente/filho em drogas, etc).  


J√° pelo lado politico acho que esse fanatismo talvez venha de uma fragilidade tb que o mundo s√≥ vai ser melhor se determinada pessoa estiver no poder. Talvez o mundo politico seja at√© mais complexo para mim. Bolsonaro e Lula hoje tem uma dualidade de super homem vs lex luthor, para que serve o super homem se n√£o existir um lex luthor?

Acho que originalmente para o Lula o vil√£o era a ditadura/burguesia/banco/capitalismo/patr√£o/corrup√ß√£o, hoje ele conseguiu um vil√£o bem mais interessante, e no caso do Bolsonaro, o vil√£o √© o Lula/comunismo/corrup√ß√£o.

175, Sep	1 Macc. 1:10 &amp; 2 Macc. 4:7 

Antiochus IV Epiphanes succeeds Seleucus IV Philopator.

175		2 Macc. 4:7

Jason outbids High Priesthood from Antiochus and succeeds his brother Onias III.

175-172	2 Macc. 4:10ff.

Jason begins Hellenizing Judean life.

172		2 Macc. 4:21

Antiochus greeted with pomp in Jerusalem on way to secure the Philistine border with Egypt (the imputed ‚Äú1st invasion‚Äù of Egypt in 2 Macc.) after the coronation of Egyptian King Philometor in 172.

172-171	2 Macc. 4:23-26

Menelaus, son of Simon, a Tobiad, outbids Jason, an Oniad, for the High Priesthood and drives Jason as a fugitive into the land of Ammon. 

172/1-169	2 Macc. 4:27-32

Menelaus has trouble delivering his promised tribute to Antiochus, resorting to theft of holy vessels from the Temple. 

172/1-169	2 Macc. 4:33

Onias III protests this theft and retreats to the place of sanctuary of Apollo and Artemis at Daphne, a city 5 miles from Antioch. 

172/1-169	2 Macc. 4:34

Menelaus, by means of Antiochus‚Äô regent Andronicus, has Onias III lured from his sanctuary and killed. 

172/1-169	Josephus, Antiq, Book XII, Chapter 10 (edition of W. Whiston)

Onias III‚Äôs son, Onias IV, flees to Ptolemy VI Philometor and Cleopatra in Egypt where he is allowed to erect a Temple to God at Heliopolis.

172/1-169	2 Macc. 4:35-38

The Jews protest the murder of Onias III, and Antiochus IV has Andronicus executed.

169		1 Macc. 1:16-20; 2 Macc. 5:1-6

Jason, thinking Antiochus was killed while invading Egypt, rebels against Menelaus, to try and reacquire the High Priesthood, and attacks Jerusalem, taking much of the city. Menelaus retreats to the Citadel which is held by a Syrian garrison.

169		2 Macc. 5:10-14,7-10

Antiochus hears of this and takes the city back from Jason and forces him back into exile in Ammon. 

169	 	1 Macc. 1:20-23; 2 Macc. 5:15-21
Menelaus lets Antiochus enter the Temple itself to steal the votive offerings of prior kings.

169 		2 Macc. 5: 22-23

Antiochus leaves Menelaus in charge of civil government as High priest, but established military governors (Phillip in Jerusalem and Andronicus over Samaria) and kills many who practice the Jewish Law.

168		1 Macc. 1:29-35

Antiochus invades Egypt again, and demands tribute from Menelaus, sending his general Apollonius to extract it from the populace by extreme means if necessary. 

168 or 167	1 Macc. 1:41-53; 2 Macc. 5:24-26

Antiochus commands that all peoples in his empire follow Hellenic ways, and forbids the practice of the Jewish Law on pain of death. Apollonius enforces the decree.

168/7		1 Macc. 2:1-48

The priest Mattathias, a priest of the order of Jorarib, defies Antiochus IV‚Äôs order and starts a guerrilla war against the Syrians and those who apostatized with Menelaus.

167, Dec 6	1 Macc. 1:54-64; 2 Macc. 6:1-7:42

The Temple is profaned by the erection of a ‚Äúdesolating sacrilege/horrible abomination‚Äù (i.e., the ‚Äúabomination of desolation‚Äù in Daniel 9) upon the alter of burnt offerings. 

166/5		1 Macc. 2:49-69
Mattathias dies.

166/5		1 Macc. 3:1-4:35; 2 Macc. 8:1-7

Judas, son of Mattathias, takes over the resistance movement and upgrades the fight to full scale rebellion. 

165/4		1 Macc. 3:35-37

Antiochus IV‚Äôs general Lysias was sent against Judas‚Äô forces.

164		1 Macc. 3:38-4:35; 2 Macc. 8:8-36
Judas succeed in defeating the main portion of the Syrian forces in the country.

164 		1 Macc. 4:35; 2 Macc. 9:13-29

Defeat of Lysias. Lysias offers peace terms to Judas. Antiochus IV ratifies them as he was busy with a floundering campaign in Persia and/or going insane from a disease.

164, Dec	1 Macc. 6:1-17, 2 Macc. 9:1-12

Antiochus IV was defeated at Elymias in Persia, and on way back to Babylon contracted a disease that killed him. (1 Macc. 6:16, though, erroneously dates his death in the year 163/162 unless his source dated it according to a calendar that started the 149th year of the Seleucid era in the Fall of 164 instead of the Spring of 163 as was the Seleucid norm.)

164, Dec 14	1 Macc. 4:36-60; 2 Macc. 10:1-8

Rededication of the alter in the temple and fortification of Jerusalem and key towns in Judea.

164/163	1 Macc. 4:35; 2 Macc. 10:10-11

Lysias heads to Antioch to secure throne for his puppet Antiochus V Eupator, and get reinforcements to resume battle with Judas.

164 or 163	2 Macc. 10:12-13
Good relations with Ptolemy, an advisor to Antiocus V, until he is denounced as a traitor and he commits suicide.

164-162	1 Macc. 5:1-68; 2 Macc. 10:14-38; 12:1-45

Judas fights off attacks by the Syrian generals Gorgias, Timothy, and Nicanor. In the process, Judas carries the battle for Jewish freedom to foreign soil to strengthen his rebel Jewish government and protect Jews from persecution by their neighbors in Gentile towns and villages. 

163/162	1 Macc. 6:18-28

Judas lays siege to the Citadel in Jerusalem, which is still held by the Syrians, and Beth-zur, eventually taking that latter town. 

163, Fall	1 Macc. 6:29-54; 2 Macc. 13:1-22

Taking advantage of the Jewish Sabbatical year (Fall 164-Summer 163), Antiochus V and Lysias return with a large force fortified with mercenary troops and they lay siege to Jerusalem and Beth-zur. Due to a lack of provisions, Beth-zur was abandoned to the Syrians and Judas‚Äô forces defending the Sanctuary are seriously reduced. 

163/2		1 Macc. 6:55-62; 2 Macc.11:1-38; 13:23-26

Lysias finds out that there is a contender to Antiochus V‚Äôs  throne and makes peace with Judas in order to be able to head for Antioch, but tears down the city walls.

163/2		2 Macc. 13:3-8

Menelaus, who had joined Lysias‚Äô and Antiochus V‚Äôs war party, is accused by some of having started the rebellion through his misrule, and Antiochus has him executed.

Note: In 1 Maccabees, it is not always clear whether the calendar used has a new year in the Spring (in proper Seleucid and Babylonian style) or in the Fall (that used by the government in Judea, as well as for Sabbatical years). All the dates given, except the date of the rededication of the Temple, are compatible with a year starting in the Fall, but fewer would be compatible with one starting in Spring. 2 Maccabees, on the other hand, uses dates that correlate better with a new year beginning in Spring.

265,2021-07-19 18:55:55+00:00,"Overall, we are talking about addiction generally, which may be a bit of a problem, specially when talking about how we attribute certain over representations in various communities. The reasons associated with higher smoking rates in incarcerated populations may not be the same reason for an over representation of sex offenders. I think it is fine of overgeneralize to an extent, however, we should be mindful of this. I just don't think we are going to find a study that offers a robust analysis of the 100's of underlying causes to either criminality or addiction.

That being said, I thing we need to remember that the type of people who become addicts and face real problems with addiction are going to have a baseline of less impulsivity. For example, I dont have much of a history of impulsivity, but I drink more than is medically advisable. I like beer and wine. What keeps me from being an alcoholic? Well, that is a tough question. Some might consider me on the spectrum of alcoholism. That being said, I am generally not impulsive and thus, even the things I do quite often usually aren't considered an addiction or if they are considered and addiction, the consequences of that addiction are minimized and not criminal. I have worked with MANY alcoholics who have enough impulse control to not have it land them in jail or get them fired from their job. I would say this community is pretty common in the military. So, the difference between a functional alcoholic and a criminal alcoholic may be the baseline of impulse control. I am sure there are many things you enjoy doing, what keeps you from indulging in those behaviors to the extent that they become a problem? Most likely, your impulse control. That impulse control is probably the same thing that keeps you from shoplifting and hitting people you dont like. Take someone who doesn't have our level of impulse control for whatever reason, they are more likely going to indulge in their addictions and commit crime.

The problem that I have with your position is that you paint addicts as being inherently violent or prone to criminality. Additionally, you depict substances or reliance on substance as uniquely problematic. For starters, marijuana does not make people lazy. It just doesn't. Being high may make somebody lazy, but so does depression. Additionally, marijuana may make already lazy people indulge more in their laziness. However, if I recall, you are from California, a state where marijuana is legal. I would bet my bottom dollar that your doctor either occasionally smokes marijuana. When I was a nurse, the doctor I worked with was pretty open about her marijuana use. I have worked alongside plenty of physical therapists and nurses that also smoked pot. The thing is, a huge amount of people smoke pot, both productive and unproductive people. You can say the same about alcohol or even heroin. I will admit, intoxicants can often exacerbate peoples flaws. But they dont often create new flaws within individuals. I gave a lot of drugs when I was a nurse and I never had anyone become someone adopt a different personality after injecting them with fentanyl. Usually they just fell asleep or became nauseous. Anyone who became violent almost always had prone to violence or PTSD as a known baseline.

Legalization is better than decriminalization because it allows us to better ways to control the harm caused from drug intoxication and addiction as a whole. Lets say we decriminalize heroin. Cool. However, we still aren't regulating the product. f Medical grade fentanyl, which is pretty close to heroin, is a very safe and predictable drug. When I was a nurse, I gave it to post operative patients in 50 mcg does, at 5 minute intervals, at a max dose of 250 mcg. Super safe and predictable. Now, the problem is that you have no way of knowing the concentration of 1 ml of fentenyl bought on the street. This is true now and would still be true if it was decriminalized. This makes street fentanyl VERY unsafe. Without knowing the concentration, it is very easy to overdose and die. I want people to be able to buy medical grade fentanyl in controled environments.

Look, I have two young kids. If I recall, you are interested in having kids. Let me give you a sobering reality. You will have very little control, maybe no control, over your child's drug use as a parent. When my son is 16, it will be very unlikely that I know about his drug use, especially if I have a overly harsh view of it. I mean, why would he talk to me about it if I make him feel ashamed of it or punish him for it. So, I have to live with the reality that my son will likely have the opportunity to acquire and take herion at some point in his life. I can only give him the tools to make good decisions, but I cant make the choice for him. I am not thrilled with the idea of him going to a criminal drug dealer who is likely armed to buy drugs. I am not thrilled that the drugs that he may buy are made by people with absolutely not ethical standards or oversight. I am not thrilled than any product he buys is of unknown origins and can be of any concentration or cut with anything. I am not thrilled that he would be paying money to an industry that engages in death squads and human trafficing in Mexico. I am not thrilled that he would be using these drugs with absolutely no supervision and likely no means to treat an overdose. I am not thrilled that he may not have access to clean needles and may not know how to successfully find a vain. I am not thrilled that social stigma about addiction could keep him from getting treatment. I am not thrilled that he might be seen as a lesser or unworthy person because he may struggle with something.

However, with legalization, we can correct all these issues. I have held legal and clean fentanyl in my hand. Its cheap and reletivly safe. I have the professional training to inject IV medications safely, without much of a risk of infection or creating an absess. I have enough professional experience to monitor someone who is under the influence of a narcotic and I can ensure they dont asphyxiate, apsirate, or overdose. I have given narcan, given chest compressions, and have been part of codes. To every mother or father who has lost a child to opioids, there is a good chance that me or someone like me could have saved your child's life. If their kids could legally come to my clinic and shoot up, their sons and daughters would probably be alive today. But, that isn't a legal option. And where it is a legal option, they show amazing success at keeping addicts alive. Thats harm reduction. But we cant do that unless it is legal.

I live in a city with a huge drug problem. I bike to work most days and I would say that 25% of the time, I have to wake up a fentany addict along the bike path to see if they are ok. I have had to call 911 on some people and now carry narcan in my backpack. I see countless other bikers just ride by. Thankfully, my sons are 7 and 3. But I live in mortal fear that some day it might be them shooting up under an overpass with careless community members just riding by as they slowly asphyxiate. I would rather them just do it where I can keep them safe.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Can you drink with benzodiazepines?

No. Combining¬†alcohol¬†with a benzodiazepine is very dangerous. People who drink alcohol while taking this medicine will feel the effects of alcohol faster.

Legal drugs are usually enforced to be safer and higher quality, ie you wouldn't get fetanyl in your heroin or baking soda in your cocaine. It would also help reduce the negative effects since the things going into your body would be higher quality and less likely to be harmful (relatively, I mean drugs are drugs). 

It would also open the door to better treatment. Once someone becomes addicted, that's all people see them as. It makes it harder to get rehabilitation treatment the same way people can get when they're, say, trying to quit smoking or drinking.",16

porn is a physical addiction because orgasm releases oxycotin, serotonin, dopamine into your body.  these are the chemicals that make you feel good and 'rewarded'.  this is what your body becomes addicted to.

your other activities are enjoyable to you, but they do not release those chemicals the same way orgasm does.  otherwise, everyone would be playing guitar at every hour of the day.

And despite its powerful potency, fentanyl isn‚Äôt killing nearly as many people here as it is on the East Coast and in Appalachia.

In San Francisco, the consumer preference for fentanyl and relatively low death rate likely stem in large part from the way the drug is marketed by dealers...

Fentanyl that is sold here is clearly labeled. It‚Äôs rarely disguised as heroin, as it is on the East Coast and in Appalachia. As a result, users who buy fentanyl know what they‚Äôre getting and, in most cases, take the necessary precautions, Coffin said.",1

Misuse of Drugs Act 1971

Section 7 (2) (b)

Authorisation of activities otherwise unlawful under foregoing provisions.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) above,
regulations under that subsection authorising the doing of any such thing as is
mentioned in that paragraph may in particular provide for the doing of that thing to
be lawful‚Äî

(a) if it is done under and in accordance with the terms of a licence or other
authority issued by the Secretary of State and in compliance with any
conditions attached thereto; or

(b) if it is done in compliance with such conditions as may be prescribed.

Hope that makes sense, ""if it is done in compliance with such conditions as may be prescribed."" This may mean a lot of different things e.g you are not to administer injectable morpine by yourself, a nurse will come by everyday to do it for you. Or restriction on the use to a premises like your house or GP or hospital only. Or it may be the route of administration of the drug, taking it as prescribed e.g vaping cannabis instead of smoking it, taking a codeine pill orally without sniffing it.

The more obvious ones are sharing your controlled drugs, which is pretty obviously illegal. So for example if you offered a friend a puff on your vape or joint, that's considered illegal.

And there's the one where you must actually used the prescribed medicine. E.g if you run out of codine tablets, it's illegal to go buy some off the street and take them, even if you have a prescription. Same with cannabis.

With that video drew did, he was using the medicine not as advised (illegal), he was smoking in a group, and shared it, which is suppling others with your medication if anyone else had a puff (illegal), he also didn't use his prescribed medication for the joint (illegal), and had cannabis that wasn't prescribed on his person (illegal).

Basically he was doing a bunch of stuff that was illegal or raised questions at the very least.

Hope that makes sense :)",1

The duration of action for benzos is probably shorter when snorted because inevitably some of that powder is going to get caught in the sinuses and lungs. Which means less is received in the gut where metabolization takes place.

Opioid wise I‚Äôve come to notice a noticeably faster onset with duration not being effected too much. Some, but I would say it‚Äôs negligible. Some opioids only work when snorted or sublingually/in the cheek (buccal). Fentanyl and buprenorphine are good examples. Both work great nasally, and sublingual/buccal. However orally they‚Äôre greatly deminished. Heroin/dicetylmorphine doesn‚Äôt seem to work orally well, like regular morphine. But is great nasally, more so than morphine. 

This isn‚Äôt the case for most benzos and benzologues however, just due to chemical and metabolite properties.",1

Or in the case of compound fractures, you arrange your mangled limb in a way you can carry it without looking at it and never break that promise to yourself and stay calm and convince yourself you are soaked with sweat and not blood. 

All my breaks never got above 7 before I was in medical care and recieved painkillers.  

The compound fractures however, required surgery and the pain afterwards, mainly from the surgical drip tube, was a sickening close 10, in the moments when your painkiller trigger switch was on cooldown.

360,2021-07-14 19:23:05+00:00,"Hey man, I‚Äôm not shitting on addicts. I used to be a one years ago, and a really bad one. I‚Äôm just putting info out there that really helped me with my addiction. Not trying to fight with addicts or say that addicts are weak minded or anything like that. I understand some peoples lives lead them to bad places. That‚Äôs what happened to me. Only point I was making was that if you have self control you can use meth recreationally. Hell no I don‚Äôt think a recovering meth addict should ever touch it again. Or any person with an addictive personality should touch it. But some people can use it recreationally. Im using jt right now in which is why I‚Äôm typing so much.It is definitely extremely addictive but if your mindset is right and you are in a good place in life you can use it for fun without craving it. I take two big hits and it literally lasts me all day. Yeah I think about taking another hit sometimes, but I simply refuse to let myself. Before I would crush bowl after bowl just to maintain a buzz. Meth is a lot of fun and I think there is a stigma with it that makes it seem like the worst drug out there, but that‚Äôs just not the case, at least for me and probably a lot of other people. I just wanted to put the way I think when using drugs out there so that maybe someone could see it from a different perspective than what they see. And I keep the idea that I can get addicted at the top of my mind above everything else. It‚Äôs a lot harder to get addicted if you just say no when it‚Äôs time to reup, or tel yourself you can‚Äôt use because you didn‚Äôt take a long enough break from using. For me and my addictions I watched them form slowly and they got worse and worse over years. At first it was I‚Äôll just do this today then it went to twice a week, then 3 times, you get the point. But now I taught myself that tolerance is a bitch to deal with and switching up my drugs is way more fun than sticking with one and fiending for it all the time. Tolerance is the real reason why people get so addicted so quickly. People need to kill the chase the dragon mindset before they even try a drug and it would make them far less likely to become an addict. I understand most people don‚Äôt just say I‚Äôm going to try this drug today, it usually starts with a lot of pain and suffering, but if people would put in some time and energy that they probably don‚Äôt have into their mindset, they can teach themselves how to use responsibly. This isn‚Äôt just drugs this is with anything that you want in life. I know what I wrote is something that alot of addicts won‚Äôt agree with, but I was more or less telling people that aren‚Äôt addicts yet that meth is just like any other hard drug out there. Its just as addictive as Xanax, oxy, aderall, and even fetanyl. I like to see arguments from all perspectives before I make conclusions. so I‚Äôm sure if you give my perspective at least a little consideration you would understand what I‚Äôm saying just like I get what your saying but still slightly disagree. Just like I don‚Äôt know your life, or how you got addicted. You don‚Äôt know mine, how badly addicted I used to be, and how this mindset changed me.

368,2021-07-14 05:40:40+00:00,"The biggest thing is just being treated like a normal person.

I wasn't even real homeless. No addictions, debt, no problem affording food. I lost my home due to having to move and not making enough to afford rent anywhere else while working my full time job that I'd had for a while. I lived in my car, I had a gym membership with showers to use, and a helpful relative who let me store stuff in their garage and stay over on the rare occasion that I had consecutive days off so the drive was worth it.

I made the mistake of being open about the situation hoping it would lead to potentially finding housing with a coworker. It wasn't uncommon for coworkers to be moving and looking for roommates.

Being homeless has such a huge stigma attached to it that it just became obvious quite quickly that I was a tainted one not to be interacted with among all that knew. Management became aware, had a lot of awkward conversations about it, proceeded to start writing me up for the most random and completely benign things. 

When you're homeless, you're dirty. You're shit. Everyone thinks it and it shows. It doesn't matter if you can shower daily, it's such a huge stigma for most people. 

I managed to find some other people on craigslist needing housing but without a fixed timeline, found a house for us to move into which was cheaper than renting my own apartment, and locked it down. 

Ended up losing my job right after, didn't bother telling them I wasn't homeless anymore even though that was probably a lot of why. I happened to fall onto a job as a DSP just by chance having known someone through the relative I stayed with and having been good at helping out with their kid who had a disability. Moved on to management from there, eventually left the company to move out of the area and now I work in outreach services myself. 

That's the biggest thing, see the person seperate from the situation. The situation is the problem for you to solve, the person isn't. 

I fully believe that people first language is both overly PC bullshit and a cop out to avoid people first thinking and is overtaking the whole industry. As is the whole active listening thing where one is expected to parrot back everything said in order to somehow show that you care. It's patronizing. It's just another brand of stigma, a supposedly kinder one. 

Meet people where they are. You can see someone who is ""a person who is unhoused and suffering from an opioid dependence"", or you can see Pete who had a lot of unresolved trauma in his past, does fentenyl because it is the only thing that makes him feel normal, and can't find a place to live because of it and then address that, as the problem it is. 

Also, my personal number one rule of being good at outreach work is remove the stick from your ass. Most people in this line of work have one way up there, so far up they have a sore throat and are grumpy about it. Don't take it too seriously, joke around with your clients, despite the shituations they're in, having someone there who gets to know them, has a sense of humour paired with a calm and confident demeanor goes a long way. Never be overbearing, be someone they like spending time with and ensure they know what kind of help you're capable of giving them when they're ready to accept it. Keep the stressful research part of the job to yourself if your organization will give you the admin time for it. Your clients should see the help you're offering as being calm and effortless. They should never feel that they're taxing you or causing you stress. You're just someone they feel safe talking to who helps chip away at their situation but by bit until they no longer need you.",5

But I haven‚Äôt seen any change with how often they prescribe it lately, in fact, it seems like the opposite. Just earlier this year one of my friends had a muscle hyperextension and was literally doped up hard for months after the incident. Not to mention both my parents are really doped up on meds as well and they don‚Äôt even have it that bad really, just some joint pain.

Thankfully I haven‚Äôt needed opiates regardless or even had pain bad enough to go to the doctors in a long time (last time I get opiates was when I had strep), so at least I don‚Äôt have to worry.

But anyway, I still find it weird whenever people say opiate epidemic, because like, they‚Äôre prescribing pain meds **for pain**. Like, by that logic, we have an SSRI epidemic, a therapy epidemic, an anesthesia epidemic, and a birth control epidemic: because those meds are all prescribed to treat their respective conditions at a high rate as well. It‚Äôs also kind of ironic because the opiate scare was supposed to make it harder for dealers to get pills or for people to sell/abuse them, but all it did was make people stop using the relatively safe prescription opiates and start using the more dangerous opiate street drugs, so more people ended up dying from heroin and sometimes fetanyl overdoses than they would‚Äôve from taking the prescription opiate pain pills (not to mention that the street drugs don‚Äôt make the government any money either because the purchases obviously can‚Äôt be taxed).

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

 ‚ÄúQuando os poetas falam da morte, chamam-lhe ‚Äòo lugar sem seios‚Äô‚Äù, disse [Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/ilustrad/fq2104201019.htm). Eu n√£o convivi tanto com poetas como de la Serna, mas acredito que seja isso que os poetas dizem e concordo. E por isso mesmo tenho aproveitado o meu tempo neste lugar com seios que √© a vida para contemplar, estudar e refletir sobre seios.

 As pessoas que menos partilham esta minha paix√£o costumam ser, curiosamente, propriet√°rias de seios. O que √© misterioso para mim, tenho reparado, √© prosaico e desinteressante para as mulheres. Se, junto de amigas, refiro a excelente e informativa ‚ÄúHist√≥ria do Seio‚Äù, da professora [Marilyn Yalom](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/contardocalligaris/2013/08/1323252-palavras-de-amor.shtml), elas afastam-se ‚Äîlevando consigo, evidentemente, os seus seios. Conversar sobre seios afugenta seios, constato com m√°goa.

 No entanto, devo registrar aqui, entusiasmado e agradecido, a √∫nica vantagem desta [pandemia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/coronavirus): as mulheres que me rodeiam t√™m discorrido longamente sobre o uso de suti√£.

Quase todas as mulheres que conhe√ßo deixaram de usar suti√£ durante o confinamento, e trocam impress√µes umas com as outras, √† minha frente, acerca da nova liberdade que descobriram e do conforto de que agora desfrutam. A sensa√ß√£o √© t√£o libertadora que muitas est√£o decididas a n√£o voltar a usar suti√£, ou pelo menos n√£o voltar a usar com tanta frequ√™ncia.

  Nestas conversas, como √© natural, eu n√£o tenho experi√™ncias pessoais para relatar, mas estou t√£o feliz por finalmente participar no debate que cito a professora Yalom, designadamente o cap√≠tulo dedicado √† hist√≥ria do [suti√£](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2021/06/victorias-secret-troca-angels-por-empoderamento-feminino.shtml) ‚Äîque, √© curioso, n√£o tem mais de cem anos, mas j√° teve v√°rias formas, consoante o padr√£o de beleza da √©poca, e foi feito de v√°rios materiais, e a primeira patente foi vendida pela sua inventora, uma mulher chamada Mary Phelps Jacobs, por US$ 1.500, embora mais tarde a mesma patente tenha sido avaliada em US$ 15 milh√µes, quem diria.

 Ao menos 17 exames que usam a marca desse laborat√≥rio j√° foram identificados como falsificados. Como n√£o h√° um local de refer√™ncia para a realiza√ß√£o do teste RT-PCR exigido ao p√∫blico da partida, a fraude pode estar ocorrendo com os documentos de outras empresas.

 Em nota, a Conmebol reconheceu ter detectado ""uma consider√°vel quantidade de testes de PCR fraudulentos"". A entidade afirmou que as pessoas com laudos falsificados n√£o poder√£o entrar no est√°dio.

 ""A Conmebol assegura que os controles para o ingresso √† final da Copa Am√©rica ser√£o extremamente rigorosos"", disse a entidade em nota.

 A Prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro [autorizou a presen√ßa de p√∫blico no Maracan√£](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2021/07/prefeitura-do-rio-libera-10-de-publico-na-final-da-copa-america.shtml) limitada a 10% da capacidade do est√°dio ‚Äîcerca de 6.500 torcedores. A Conmebol planeja credenciar 4.400 convidados divididos entre as duas confedera√ß√µes finalistas.

  Uma das exig√™ncias do munic√≠pio foi a apresenta√ß√£o de teste RT-PCR negativo feito 48 horas antes da partida. O objetivo √© evitar que o [evento seja local de transmiss√£o do novo coronav√≠rus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2021/07/copa-america-falha-em-transparencia-sobre-casos-de-covid-afirmam-pesquisadores.shtml), em raz√£o da pandemia.

 A Conmebol, contudo, n√£o tem um laborat√≥rio de refer√™ncia, com o qual mantenha alguma ferramenta de checagem dos testes apresentados.

 A propriet√°ria da Laborlife, Priscila Amaral, disse ter sido informada por um cliente argentino que uma pessoa estava oferecendo laudos da empresa por R$ 150 sem a necessidade de realiza√ß√£o de exame. A cl√≠nica cobra R$ 450 para testes de emerg√™ncia, com resultado entregue em seis horas.

 Amaral disse ter entrado em contato com o consulado argentino, que repassou a informa√ß√£o √† Conmebol. A empres√°ria afirma que a fraude consiste na troca dos dados do paciente testado a partir de um laudo negativo real.

 ‚ÄúMinha equipe de inform√°tica fez √†s pressas uma ferramenta para checagem dos laudos. De cara identificaram dois laudos falsos. Se est√° acontecendo comigo, pode estar acontecendo com v√°rios outros laborat√≥rios‚Äù, disse ela.

 Ao liberar o p√∫blico no est√°dio, o prefeito Eduardo Paes (PSD) afirmou considerar a final um evento-teste para futuras libera√ß√µes, ainda n√£o previstas no munic√≠pio.

 ‚ÄúFoi feito um pedido para libera√ß√£o de 50%, que foi recusado. Eu soube do pedido pela imprensa, a SMS [Secretaria Municipal de Sa√∫de] analisou e negou. E, com um novo pedido, entendeu, com toda a liberdade do mundo, que 10% n√£o seria problema. Eu n√£o recebi press√£o da Confedera√ß√£o Brasileira de Futebol (CBF), da Conmebol, de ningu√©m‚Äù, afirmou.

As duas torcidas ficaram concentradas em um √∫nico setor do est√°dio, promovendo aglomera√ß√£o.

 Os 2.200 convidados credenciados pela CBF (Confedera√ß√£o Brasileira de Futebol) ficar√£o alocados no Setor Norte do est√°dio. A outra metade, composta por argentinos credenciados pela AFA (Associa√ß√£o do Futebol Argentino), ficar√° no Setor Sul. A inten√ß√£o √© evitar a aglomera√ß√£o de torcedores.

Nenhum deles foi informado sobre esses detalhes epidemiol√≥gicos durante a competi√ß√£o. Eles alegaram saber dos n√∫meros de casos apenas por meio da imprensa

 A Fiocruz √© o bra√ßo do Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de respons√°vel pelo monitoramento epidemiol√≥gico do coronav√≠rus no Brasil. Seu setor de virologia √© credenciado pela Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de para realizar esse acompanhamento.

 At√© aqui, foram 168 casos de Covid detectados entre os envolvidos no torneio. Destes, o sequenciamento gen√©tico (exame para identificar a cepa do v√≠rus) foi realizado em 38, sendo que para 22 o processo j√° foi conclu√≠do e o resultado foi de variante gama.

 O Rio de Janeiro vive atualmente um al√≠vio no n√∫mero de interna√ß√µes decorrentes da Covid-19. O √∫ltimo balan√ßo aponta para 563 pessoas internadas em leitos da rede p√∫blica da cidade, menor n√∫mero desde abril de 2020, in√≠cio da pandemia.

dmt:es uno de los alucinogenos mas potentes a nivel de efectos , es el pricipal principio de la ayahuasca o yage (los dos son sinonimos )

444,2021-07-09 19:35:53+00:00,"First of all, I‚Äôm sorry you had and have this difficult path of life you‚Äôre walking. I can‚Äôt pretend to know what you‚Äôre feeling or how you‚Äôre feeling exactly. 

As I understand it correctly the ADHD meds are very helpful and with them you do feel better. Probably the reason why you‚Äôre so tempted to take more of it than what is prescribed. When you ‚Äòabuse‚Äô  them, do you just run out of the prescription supplied ones early or do you also have access to more through a dealer or something?  Because if that‚Äôs not the case the solution I‚Äôve worked out with my pharmacy might be something that works for you too. 

I have and absolutely need oxycodon prescriptions but I have abused them badly in the past too. I ran out pretty quickly and was left in withdrawal for the remainder of it. Pretty unstable situation and hellish everytime. So together with my GP and pharmacy we decided that if i hadn‚Äôt access to more than i was prescribed per day, I couldn‚Äôt abuse them and couldn‚Äôt run out early. No rocket science but still a true fact. Since then they deliver my daily dose everyday in so called Baxter rolls. It worked from day 1 and 1,5yrs in now it still does. No more abuse because I can‚Äôt and have a stable level of the painkillers so it works at it‚Äôs best. 

Maybe that could be a solution to you as well, if you have no other way to gain them from somewhere or someone else, you get your dose you need every day and build a stable level of it for them to work as best they can. That way you reap the benefits and will work well for you after all. If the pharmacy might not be able to do this, maybe you can ask your GP if he can keep them in office and you can pick your daily dose up from there? Alternatively I know there are storage capsules with timed locks, whatever you put in them and set the timer for what you need it to be it will open on that time and day only. (Can‚Äôt cheat with those, once locked in you have to wait for the timer to open it. 

I hope this might be a solution for you as you said you do benefit greatly from the ADHD meds . That way you don‚Äôt have to give them up but can reap the benefits of them. 

All the best to you.",3

That's the problem, it looks like you are downplaying the responsibility of the few people (like the Sacklers) who were actually pushing opioids. They deliberately put false information out there, I don't think that doctors who did do the reading and saw research saying oxycotin wasn't addictive should be blamed as either first or second place in responsibility for the opioid crisis. I'm not saying a lot of people shouldn't have done better, but blaming the doctors for reading what was given to them when ~~many~~ the vast majority of doctors don't have the time or money to conduct independent follow-up research of their own doesn't seem like the right way to go.",1

Flare ups are awful, but just keep on top of the steroid cream. I use it once a week (sometimes twice), and once a day for two weeks if I'm having really bad symptoms. Do exactly what the dr tells you. I also highly recommend seeing a gynecologist, vs. a regular dr. Make sure you have it checked at least once a year to make sure nothing crazy is going on. 

I also have Morphea (a rare type of scleroderma). I've often wondered if theyre related - so far nothing I've read has been conclusive. Super frustrating dealing with two types of autoimmune skin diseases. 

I think the lichen sclerosis started when I was a young child, but it wasn't diagnosed until my early 20s! It kind of laid dormant for a few years, then came back with a vengeance. So happy that you were able to catch it early.

Although tbh, I've never actually viewed my addictions as problems because I'm literally a psychopath when I'm off my meds (drugs) so anything that can make me be a better person and husband, I'll gladly accept the addiction aspect (not to mention I'm a pure hedonist). However, I don't want to have my wife find my dead body from an OD; she's already saved me twice and is mildly traumatized by that. If I were to succumb to death, it would destroy her. So I'm doing my best to stay away from street drugs because EVERYTHING has fetanyl in it nowadays. I mainly stick to my prescribed buprenorphine and marijuana. On the few occasions where I get meth or Xanax or acid, etc. from the streets, I have regeant tests and fetanyl test strips to ensure it's safe.

I do agree with that dude in that it's EXTREMELY peaceful and no pain or anything, but I can't relate to the aspect of there being something. For me, it was all darkness and nothingness. But maybe that's my own personal hell for the horrible things I've done in my 30 years on this Earth. Or maybe it's because of the way I entered death's realm. Perhaps you have to be more sober/conscious when you begin to die so your body has a chance to release all those DMT-esque chemicals so that you feel like you're entering Heaven. Personally, while I have gotten more spiritual as I've aged, and I do acknowledge that there COULD be some sort of supreme being, I lean heavily towards atheism and don't believe in an afterlife - unless I needed to be dead for longer to be sent there.

 I had a pic line put in in Radioligy. It's a tube that is inserted into a vein in the upper arm and is fed to just above the heart. I quite enjoy having one in. 

The chemo is intense to begin with to kill the cancer. You more than likely will have to have regular lumber punctures to test you spinal fluid and at the same time inject chemo to prevent cancer going to the brain. That part isn't nice but with a good doctor it's bearable. Ask for plenty of local anaesthetic. I was also given a 100 micrograms of fentonyl to calm the nerves. It can also be done with general anaesthetic.

My wife brought me my favourite healthy food. Don't worry when you can't eat. I was able to make toast. Lemonade is good when your feeling nauseous. Good medication is also Ondansetron to prevent nausea. Your only allowed 16 milligrams a day. It works well. 

I had my laptop tethered to my phone.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

Don't get me wrong they feel different, but the problem is all potent opioids have a very high potential to get you mind hooked to that feeling if wellbeing. You cant get physically addicted after one time use, some people will disagree with me but I'm sure that your mind is going to remember that feeling for the rest of your life, I'm not saying that your mind is addicted after one time use but if you have problems in you life or simply don't feel good in your own skin it is likely that you will do it again and get addicted. Nobody says about their first time using heroin that it had an positive impact on their life, in fact most if not all people wish they never did it. If you want it so much you could try weaker opioids, your tolerance isn't there so anything from this class of drugs will probably get you high and if you find out that you like that feeling you should try to stay away from it for at least 3 months, if you aren't able to stay away from it this short time you should stay away from it forever, still I wouldn't recommend it, I wouldn't wish it to my worst enemy.

536,2021-07-04 11:07:17+00:00,"Yup, this is exactly what happened to me. Different doctors told me different things to do. I met with pain team 3 times prior to surgery with concerns. I too stopped my sub the day of surgery. Just keep in mind I was having major spine surgery, they removed one of my ribs and took out some of my vertebrae to get to the cancerous tumor that was slightly pressing on my spinal cord and destroying the bones. It‚Äôs given me degenerated discs and arthritis too. 

So, I get out of surgery and go to ICU. Anesthesia was fine but immediately after I sent in convulsive pain. Like shaking, tears rolling down my face, and I‚Äôve had other major surgeries, many tattoos (enjoy the feeling of bliss they give me), and have a massive pain tolerance from many sport injuries. Shatters my collar bone and rode down the mountain on my snowboard with the bone touching my neck. Mind over matter. This was different. They had me on Fetanyl IV. Didn‚Äôt work. I begged for higher dose, they said no your on the highest. The. They kept forgetting to give me the dose every hour like you‚Äôre supposed to.. somdtjmds waited as long as 2 hours in between IV injections of fet. This lasted a day almost. I couldn‚Äôt breathe it was so bad. Then they put me on a massive Dalaudid IV with the button (PCA machine bola and basil rate) my dose was massive. This helped. Then the next dsy they drop it by half. This is from 6/23-6/25. 6/26, meaning a weekish ago, they cut me off the IV. I haven‚Äôt taken sub since before surgey since the pain was so bad that dsy in ICU. I planned on taking it again but got scared right out of it. You can indeed take sub (1.25 mg orally for past year+) through this whole process and just need absurd amounts of pain meds. But a bunch is still getting blocked and can be dangerous. They have me go to an oral lain regimen, 4mg Dalaudid every 4 hrs..!? Going from sub, to IV Dalaudid at 1.5 basil rate, and .5 bola 30 minutes lock outs is a massive step down. Not only was my lain back really bad, now I was waking up in cold sweats, shaking and not sleeping from withdrawals. Dilated pupils even!! So they upped my dose to 8mg every 4 hrs orally. Starts me on gabapentin at 100mg, 100mg, and 300mg before bed. This whole thing has been a mess. That‚Äôs a low Gaba dose, normal effective minimum (especially for major nerve pain and damage from spinal surgery) is 900mg x3 daily. That‚Äôs considered an entry level dose. Plus, they stated it 3 days after surgey and it takes time to kick in. Like wtf, where did you get you education from, McDonald‚Äôs Med school of the Incompetent!? Lol but really it isn‚Äôt funny and it‚Äôs been hell. Back to the pain meds, wtf is with under dosing me in ICU heavily, nurse being lazy missing timing, then putting me on the mega dose IV to drop me to a entry level dose of oral meds. Threw my CNS for a fing massive loop while I had just gone through one of the gnarliest types of surgeries you can get. So anyways, I complain again. They think I‚Äôm complaining to get more meds and oh he‚Äôs just in some w/ds from the subutex. Yeah right, I‚Äôm F‚Äôed up bad right now thanks to you guys. They denied my dose upping request. I mean, I was in a 6 to 10, out of 10, at all times. That‚Äôs absurd for me. I haven‚Äôt touched oxy since 2013. I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs, I could care less about getting high. The next day they decide to put me on 10mg of oxy every 4 hrs‚Ä¶ now my dose is even lower? Like literally wtf. After two days of constant complaining I get the dose to 20mg every 4 hrs as needed. Aka every 4 hrs. 20mg of oxy is a decent dose but for someone who‚Äôs been on sub for 7 years and then on a massive IV of Dalaudid isn‚Äôt at all OPIATE NIEVE!!! Hello!? That‚Äôs a dose you would give my gf whose never touched an opiate in her life for this type of severe pain. I did loads of research snd checked National guidelines and papers documented on .gov websites. 30-90mg is the proper dose for every 4-6 hrs. I‚Äôm so upset with this whole thing and the way I‚Äôve felt. It‚Äôs been hard to breathe from pain, still to this dsy in major pain and it‚Äôs the 4th of July now!!! It‚Äôs just I got stuck at NIH in Maryland. I got flown to their research facility for emergency surgery. They paid for it since my cancer is so damn rare. But still, I had surgey set up in Denver that was also laid for. And had a proper team with a clear 1-3 month medication taper plan for post op. Plus, rehab for walking, special custom fit and ordered back brace. The whole nine yards. I don‚Äôt even have s fucking back brace from NIH. And now, since this has taken a big financial burden on me since I had all these tests for 5 months prior to pay for I had to move back in with my parents across the country (Maine from Denver Colorado) after 12 years on my own. I‚Äôm 30 FYI. 31 in 10 days. Once I talked to NIH I flew out 6 days later so it was all rushed. Make matters worse, I have to artichoke my health insurance now, and doctors to Maine which they knew. Still, they only gave me enough meds for two days travel then sent me to jump down to 10mg a day for 3 days. So 5 days of meds on the 4th of July weekend when I specifically asked for 2 weeks worth since I don‚Äôt have a doctor yet in Maine. They said sure. Then the day of discharge, which was 4 days earlier than planned, they messed up my prescription and wrote out 10mg for 3 days. Not even the 20mg dosing for 2 days of travel. Since I have to drive with my mother from Maryland to Maine. I‚Äôm in NH right now at a motel since the pain was so bad. I also stopped in NJ at a friends house and had to take a day off of becaus of the pain. My lower back got a huge bulge out of no where. I call Nuero team snd they‚Äôre like well it should be okay, it‚Äôs probably liquid. If it gets worse go to the ER. Wtf!? So, I‚Äôm about to run out of meds real soon, already on s super aggressive taper which is making my pain and withdrawals come back. This taper according to .gov websites should be supervised at s facility. 20-50% dose drop in days? This is all so mind boggling. I had planned to go back to Denver but can‚Äôt afford it so I told them. They said they would work with me. This is not working with me. This is jeopardizing my sobriety and all my 7 years hard work getting off opiate prescriptions from age 11-21. I did a year of on the street Percocet. I call them circus pets. To out the icing on the cake, NIH doesn‚Äôt do referrals or anything because they are a government research facility. So I had to figure that out as well on my own. So, come July 6th I‚Äôll have no pain meds, just jumping off at 10mg every 4 hrs unless I can get s script called in some how from a different doctor. Even worse Pain and withdrawals are in order for me thanks to these idiot doctors and protocols. I swear they have treated me leased because of admitting my opiate addiction/substance abuse from 7 years ago. Disgusting and not right. First of all get educated if you‚Äôre going to practice medicine on people. They even made mistakes like leaving my center line (jugular) in for well over a week. 

Sorry a lot right there. Happy 4th!!! Stay safe and healthy!! If I did have meditation, a huge support network, and grit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd probably have taken my life by now.",1

They also supplied luxury trips and fancy sports cars as rewards for production to the farmers..  This strain was genetically manipulated to produce mainly Thebaine for synthesis of oxy and hydo codone and morphone among others.

One day J&amp;J had to figure out how to pay all this money back they used to reward the Tasmanian farmers so lucratively with. Thus the OPIOID Crisis was born.

Big pharma peddled their goods to the point of almost forcing DR ""s into writing script after script. They spent millions on advertising claiming the drugs were not addictive and were the cure all and end all of pain meds.  J&amp;J and some huge names in the pharma companies made billions off of our pain and suffering.

Suddenly a change in the white house and the epidemic was publicized and VILLAINIZED to the point of a almost complete shut down on meds desperately needed buy suffering chronic pain patients who have depended on them for years.. Meanwhile law abiding citizens have resorted to other means of relief. Heroin distribution has tripled and Fentanyl overdoses have skyrocketed . Even hospice patients have felt the wave and have to die suffering and without comfort or dignity. 

Doctors treat people in pain now like junkies looking for a fix.. Scared to loose their 6 figure salary if they show compassion. I for one am sick of it.. Who is the real criminal here. Everyone has the right to be pain free. Who decided we couldn't.. What the same company that powdered your grandmas butt when she was a baby..  No more tears my ass.. Someone needs to be accountable. Someone needs to fix this!! We are not Villains or criminals or even junkies.. THEY ARE! If wanting to be pain free and feel good with a great quality of life every day is considered addiction, than aren't we all junkies.??

Shame on all of them fighters of this so called epidemic.. Feeling good is human nature and we are all human.. God gave US the poppy and everything in it .. Who has the right to decide who gets what. I say we RISE UP and stand together united as brothers and fight for drug reform.. Lower medication prices across the board and RE-OPEN the pill presses for all of humanity.

They need accountability so throw out anything J&amp;J boycott baby shampoo and powders from J&amp;J. If we win they won't feel any pain anyway.. Keep the faith my brothers and sisters for the resistance is rising in the east. We will not be thwarted..DOC has spoken!!!!

566,2021-07-02 14:19:41+00:00,"First off, great video summarizing basically every aspect of this case! My thoughts are the following:

Do we know if they ""passed"" polygraph tests? We know the parents said they did, but TBI never confirmed? (not sure if they would even if they passed?). Maybe they told them they didnt ""fail"" the poly, but that still leaves door to have shown deception. 

The Dad apparently is the intelligent adult in the household based on how much we hear from him in comparison to mom/grandma. I think that is important to remember when trying to link any of these geniuses to other disappearances. Also - anyone else notice the mothers appearance in the video? Appeared to be wearing a confederate flag hat and an inside out (vulgar?) tank top. 

I wouldnt find any of the next 3 things concerning, but when you include all 3 it is damning: 1) The shaved head contradiction 2) both parents guiding investigation towards- she went outside back door and was abducted (These people aren't Sherlock Holmes and Watson) 3) The past tense comment WITH blubbering explanation for using past tense.

Additionally, I doubt this family was on prescription pill medication. This is Hawkins County, TN. I do not see a guy with Well's rap sheet having great insurance. Also, prescription opioids are very expensive, and heavily monitored these days. They would be turning to cheaper street drugs (Heroin, Fetanyl), marijuana, and copious amounts of low-end beer. The house and property were such a mess, I doubt investigators could spot a clue if there was one (see can of Raid somewhere is basically jumping up and down on in yard). 

Lastly, if the neighbor that wrote the FB post is accurate, DCS really let Summer down and she really never had a chance. I would think the neighbor would know this family more intimately than church worshipers, for example, that see them for 1.5 hours on Sunday. I think if parents are involved as most (and myself) suspect, then it was probably due to negligence, not down right murder. I know one thing, they weren't planting flowers and she disappeared within that time frame. I also don't see the mom taking a 10 min leisurely fun walks on a curvy back road (and when you go for a walk, who walks for only 10 min?).

Hope they solve this!",3

568,2021-07-02 13:10:38+00:00,"Holy shit... Prohibition dates back to the Harrison Act of 1915. Opiods like Morphin are absolutely not dangerous when used correctly and every single hospital on earth is well equipped with opiods because of their acknowledged safety. Morphin (or diamorphin) are on the WHO's list of essential meds for fucks sake! 
Wow it's 2021 and people are still unable to understand what caused the crisis and OD's:

The people that got those pills prescribed were often cut off by their doctors due to a ridiculous law that exists thx to prohibitionists endangering the docs license if he or she prescribed opiods to someone showing signs of withdrawal and were subsequently pushed into the black market where fentanyl is widespread. Fentanyl being in Heroin is also a direct result of prohibition which is easily preventable. 

(Alcohol is not on that list btw.)

You're definitely  unaware of the difference between a black market and regulated access to the substance someone's dependent on in regard to the effects on the users life. 

Dr Plattner is my Doctor and he'd be just as appalled at the comparison between opiod maintenance therapy and Russian roulette as I am. Not a single person has died in OMT because it's controlled and supervised. 

Dr. Mark's Patients achieved a reduction of drug related crime of 93% by giving the people the medecine they are dependent on and were committing crimes for.

Overland content is easy, there are some public dungeons and worldbosses wich are challenging. Dungeons are getting harder as you progress, you will unlock veteran modes too. 

About questing.. I think its the best of all mmos, there are actual stories, vocie act and no fetch quest and kill 10 x or gather 10 y, if you have to do something like this, there is a story and purpose behind it. Yes, most of the quests are designed for single play, but there are dailies with cool rewards in every dlc zone, ppl are like to share those quests and doing them together.

Overall ESO is designed like a casual mmo, some call it mmo lite. But there are a lots of things to do, ingame systems are designed very well. ESO offers cool dugneons, trials, stories, crafting, fashion stuff, housing, nice adventuring, treasure hunting (antiq), large and small scale pvp like cyrodil, battlegrounds and some pvpve too. You can experimenting with character building, maybe meta things are not the best for you, you can figure out something fits more for your style, there are a tons of sets and build options to choose from.

Thats it for me, I recommend you to give it another chance, try to get familiar with everything before you reach cp160, go for all the dungeons in normal mode, complete the quests in them, try battlegrounds if you are interested in pvp. Join some guilds, they will help you if you have any questions.

If we consider something to be "" settled "" but dont consider the flaws of historical science or imagine what could be and  simply think that what we have today is the pinnacle of understanding then sure you could say something is settled but considering what we may know tomorrow always has the potential to invalidate what we know today makes "" settled science "" an absurd phrase doesnt it?",1

Meth costs between $3-$500 per gram, which is a big range  
There are 450 grams in a pound.  
Therefore, meth costs $1,350-$225k per pound.  
The meth is apparently high quality, so a $40k figure doesn't seem absurd. For reference, a pound of meth has ~1,800 ""hits"". So, at $40k, they are paying $22 per ""hit""(dose).

I wish they would approve bupropion for meth withdrawl like they do suboxone or methadone for opiates.

599,2021-07-01 10:53:24+00:00,"Oh wow, so many dumb  and naive points in one comment, I'll have to break it down.  
1. I don't know about any other country, but if you are a US citizen and think the government's job is to dictate the rights of the people, then you likely failed your highschool civics course. The government's job is explicitly to protect the rights of the individual. These rights are endowed to all US citizens intrinsically, and it is the role of government to protect these rights, not allow them or take them away. This is the most fundamental part of the US constitution and it's exactly why Americans make such a big deal about freedom.   
2. What ""health professionals"" are you trusting? The bureaucrats? The pharmaceutical company executives that get referenced by all the news agencies? Or the clinical studies that show for certain age groups, the vaccination is just as risky as catching covid (or for &lt;16 males, it's potentially worse)? Are you afraid of variants, even though every study on infectious disease shows that these kinds of virus's mutate to be more virulent, but significantly less deadly? I'd love to know which experts and which studies you're referring to specifically, because in case you haven't noticed, every expert or credentialed scientist that goes against the approved narrative has been completely censored from social media and public discourse at large. Medical science is extremely complex, and short term correlational studies with no control group and extreme censorship coupled with conflict of interests don't exactly make me confident.  
Remember when they said, ""oxycodone/oxycontin isn't addictive""? Remember when they said ""Morphene isn't addictive""? Remember when they said ""Fentanyl will fix the opioid crisis""? Remember when they sold drugs they knew were cytotoxic, but they lied about their trial numbers and told the government ""just fine us, we don't care"", and they got a slap on the wrist and made billions? Remember when the pharmaceutical companies donated more money in lobbying than any other industry in the united states?  
Yeah, I think I'll wait until longitudinal studies are released, instead of ""taking it on faith"" from the criminals who released this drug and, by the way, are exempt from any liability up front.   
You're a fool if you think what you're guided by has anything to do with science.",1

607,2021-06-30 22:03:13+00:00,"Soy de Bogot√°, que ya fue mencionada como un problema en s√≠ misma por el centralismo y la desigualdad, y estoy de acuerdo. Sin embargo quer√≠a  llamar la atenci√≥n con qu√© el ""progreso"" o el ""desarrollo"" no significa lo mismo para cada persona, cada cultura y cada contexto... Creo que lo estamos reduciendo a t√©rminos de dinero, y de generar empresa u oportunidades. Eso est√° mal pensado porque es inmediatista, no estamos protegiendo el agua, los bosques, los suelos, las semillas, el conocimiento ancestral y campesino, el aire limpio, los cultivos... Sino que pedimos que venga la carretera y el cemento, pedimos que venga la inversi√≥n extranjera, que si quieren hacer fracking que lo hagan, que si quieren dinamitar la monta√±a que lo hagan, desde que haya una plata, y unas regal√≠as (y en la administraci√≥n de esas regal√≠as viene el problema de la corrupci√≥n). 
Colombia ha perdido gran parte sus bosques, para tener ganaderos megaterratenientes, palmeros, ca√±aduzales... Entonces env√©s de seguir pensando en c√≥mo montar nuestro negocio, como salvarse uno mismo y su familia con una entradita de dinero, se deber√≠a invertir en la restauraci√≥n ecol√≥gica, en la protecci√≥n de la naturaleza y del agua para el futuro. 
Si usted quiere tener un panorama crudo de qu√© pasa con las regiones y con el pa√≠s, es que no hay un proyecto de pa√≠s, no hay un rumbo como naci√≥n o como Rep√∫blica, solo se vive improvisando y ""que sea lo que Dios quiera"". No hay un plan de que hacer con la juventud, con los pensionados, con los inmigrantes, con las v√≠ctimas del conflicto.
Y por √∫ltimo, esto es necesariamente pol√≠tico, no se puede decir que vamos a tocar el tema del ""progreso"" en las regiones sin hablar de pol√≠tica, es absurdo. Por eso tengo que decir que el partido de gobierno, el CD, y el conservador, la U y el CR, entre otros, se dedican tapar los delitos cometidos a diario e hist√≥ricamente, y a robar impunemente los recursos p√∫blicos y entregarle diariamente lo que la gente produce con el sudor de la frente a los banqueros y terratenientes. Ese es todo el ""plan"" que hay: el de la impunidad para la clase uribista-narco-paramilitar... y mientras tanto las fuerzas del mercado siguen promoviendo toda actividad extractiva, destructiva, legal o ilegal, oro, cocaina, heroina, petr√≥leo, caf√©, electricidad, maderas, tr√°fico de personas, colt√°n, esmeraldas, carb√≥n, call-center, etc√©tera... Pr√°cticamente no tenemos industrias, no modificamos los productos de la tierra (excepto ta vez la industria del narcotr√°fico y algunas alimenticias). Casos como el de la industria textil o la cerveza son casos de fracaso: comprados o quebrados, las ganacias quedan en el exterior y hasta el empleo, las empresas que antes eran colombianas ahora son extranjeras, como Avianca, por ejemplo...
Entonces pensemos en un progreso para qu√©? Hac√≠a d√≥nde? A costa del futuro? A costa de la vida? En contra del bosque y del agua y de la selva? Todos debemos vivir al estilo europeo o gringo que nos ense√±a la TV desde peque√±os?",12
