*  When was it founded

Aãɱthel in its current state  is barely a decade old, yet it has quickly become one of the most prosperous cities in the Empire.

* By who?

 Called Xikunkåtl before the Kaian occupation was the holy city of the nomadic Yisyânˈsi. 

* Who controls it right now? 

Commander Bãsev́ Key'paou has been granted full authority over  and the surrounding territory by the Kaian Empire after seizing it ten years ago although to keep a somewhat shaky peace with the Yisyânˈsi he has to  go through his son's maternal uncles due to tribal inheritance customs.

* Who lives there

Despite the conflicts between the empire and Yisyânˈsi , most are actually are ethnic Ki and Bure people who have been living in the area for centuries. Lower caste Ka have been flooding the city since the conquest, hoping to secure imperial land to improve their station.

&amp;#x200B;

* Why do they live there?

Water. Aãɱthel (lit. great desert well) is the only location in the territory able to support more than a few individuals permanently. The surrounding hard scrub also gives Aãɱthel added defensive properties 

  

*  What's it like living there?

If you're a Kaian with a sense of adventure, being on the fringe of a rather repressive society is quite liberating and the imperial settlement grants are plus as well.  Authorities here have little time or concern for your moral indiscretions as long you stay somewhat respectful of the Ɱåti xẽŝsâ. The Ki are different story as they are classified as traitors under imperial law with no rights and subject to execution. With the focus on securing the province and not losing the city as quickly a his predecessors have, Kay'paou basically listed them as part of province's public property. Bure are treated as Sikaian nationals and given only minimal attention by the new goverment. 

Daily life is hectic within the walls of the new anchor of the desert path, merchants and travelers bustling through streets exchanging goods as well as ideas from afar. Aãɱthelians basically live in the streets as most homes are little more than quick mudbrick apartments containing nothing more than a bed, small heater and washstand. 

The more conservative Ka thetsẽäyas deployed in the recent months to ""assist"" the commander find Aãɱthel and its leader morally bankrupt. Their growing efforts to get the province in line has begun to rekindle a slight unease about the future.

I have been telling and retelling my story now for almost 3 years  I kind of try not to bore people that have heard it all before from me 

I co mod several  subs here at reddit snd among these  are:

r/drugs_info

I tell my chilling story several times over on that sub and others  

i did in fact nearly die  

i had a series of seizures and very neatly died  in hospital four days with those seizures  very  neatly  bouught the farm on tjat one!

i hurss i don't really talk about the gross horrors of klonopin  bc I really dont want scare people 

klonopin is a very deadly drug and it sh be very unavailable  

IMO  klonopin is way  more deadly than common heroin - remember I said H - not referring to deadly fentenyl here  

the point is klonopin is in its effects on your mind and body  many many times worse than  any othrr benxo i have ever encountered 

llonopin is a deadly killing drug wheteas  maybe xanax only screws with you in general  

but if you screw with klonopin there is a good posdibility you will die as a result of your ever taking one pill
of klononpin ...
the stories of death and destruction from klonopin are simply legion 

there seems to be a new yerrible story about kpins almost daily!

Obviously, I welcome this opportunity to warn anout klonopin !!

Klonopin can and will  kill you if you mis manage klonopin!

Do not ever  CT  grom klonopin ...

CT equals seizues and maybe death!

Everyone I have ever spoken to about klonopin tells me 

""I wish I had stopped klonopin more gradually!""

Never hurry and try a fast detox from klonopin it might put you in hospital if you are lucky  maybe dead if you are unlucky!

there is a very famous story about a girl maybe 30 yrs and a dr getting her addicted to klonopin ...

so the apparently very true story goes dr gets girl addicted to kpons  dr does not know shit about klonopin so dr sends his case to another dr  ...
you guessef it dr no 2 knows less than dr no1  so long and short of this tragedy is that the good  drs  conspire together to kill patient dr no 1 screwed up on  

tjis is all documented on a web site that i commonly cite to on r/drugs_info  but I dont have the exact name handy  but i think it is still up on www  as a momorial to the now very long dead girl  ...  

again the dr ends up killing the patient over a med error!!

OMG!  

no  OP you are asking me the right questions about klonopin here today!

ehat to do if you are addicted today with all that we now know ?

plan a gradual taper

follow the dr Ashton manual to the letter  about tapering all benzos  ... dr ashton rules!

never  CT  klonopin  .... if you gave to  CT  and i have IRL seen these cases of forced   CT  get to a hospital or an informed dr asap!

long and short of my story is i nearly dued  bc I was careless and I tried to  

CT from kpins ...  bad move!

I am now  way past the 9ne year clean and sober mark for  WD  all kpins ...

I talk about all tjis  ad neausem but the bottom libe us I am pretty  much healed from klonopin ...
yes  my friends know I have kpins issues  lije for example I what is called  
akesthesia  but more correctly called  ""electroplexis"" issues  ...

I even now feel lije there is electricity firing t/o my body  nearly 24/7  but I adjust  but this is a serious un takked about issue .... 

my sleep remains in chaos

my mind is ok  but jyst barely ok

i am aging maybe not very well

please , great question, ask me anything about klonopin!

Thank you!

I am swan

I did read the links, it's a generic list of the harms. Let's start with what I have experience with. Shrooms and LSD can give you a bad trip, and yes people can use them as a crutch as mentioned in the articles, but even having bad trips doesn't seem to be too bad. I can genuinely say LSD helped me grow as a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cocaine is super addictive, but I've seen it used responsibly. It's not everyone's flavor, personally not mine, but that doesn't mean no one should do it.  It's like alcohol, I've had several alcoholic friends. Substance abuse can ruin lives, but the solution is good rehab solutions, not banning the substance.

&amp;#x200B;

The only drug I really have a problem with is heroin. You can argue that it's a hypocritical view, and it would be a well founded argument.  That said, I think that for most other drugs you can't really blame a dealer. Let alone the user. Users should be held responsible for what they do while under the influence, that's just common sense. But charging them for having the substance is awful.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, cocaine is unhealthy for you, but you should have the right to use it. Yes, you can have bad trips on shrooms and LSD and if you're predisposed to certain mental illnesses they can cause it, that doesn't mean they're inherently bad. Some people can enjoy themselves. Arresting people tends to ruin more lives than drug use.

&amp;#x200B;

If you really want to blame the dealer, then there needs to be a system in place to legally acquire the drugs. The dealers that are awful people are the ones that cut shit and sell impure products.  Heroin dealers cutting with fetanyl. Molly dealers normally cutting with god knows. The issue isn't the people. It's the system.",3

Then, dropped out of high school and found my dad's OC's and perc's at about the same time so I started selling his OC's and would occasionally snort some about once every week or two while I was drinking on the weekends. Kept drinking heavily (and taking kpins as RX'd for real, true anxiety but not for a buzz) until 20yrs old when I got in a car wreck. Then, I was shot up with morphine for 3 days then scripted oxy's and hydro's for 3-4 months. I tapered off the way the doctor wanted but for P/T I had to snort at least 20-80mg's of OC before and during physical therapy which I still had access to ALOT of OC's...full bottles of 10s, 20s, 40s and 80s 'cause my dad never took them except right before his pain doctor appointments. Then, went to college but opiates were always on my mind 'cause I was still in pain from my car wreck and I wanted that feeling again but was far away from my dad's OCs. Any time I'd run across somebody with pain pills, I'd buy them out. Knew a guy that got Avinza's and methadone from his dad, and another guy that got sheets of Fentora's with 4 on each sheet. I traded dirt cheap benzo's for all the pain meds (and stole my dad's OCs) so it wasn't a financial burden at all yet. I actually made $ off pills and drugs instead of spending a lot of $. Drank so much that I got pancreatitis so I stopped drinking and started smoking weed and taking more benzo's to combat the paranoia that the weed gave me. While I was in the hospital, they gave me a shot of Nubain every 3-4 hrs with promethazine also in the shots. One of the websites where I got benzo's from also had Nubain for $50 a bottle so I started buying that for pain. That led to IV'ing the Nubain instead of subQ or IM. Kept doing Nubain for years until I finished college. Then, moved home to where I could pretty much only get hydro's for 50 cents per mg, and every now and then I'd run across some OCs (which my dad had given his away by now) and MScontins, Dilaudid, Roxi's, etc.. My first 4mg dilaudid IV was probably the best rush I've ever gotten. Took hydro's and roxi's for a few yrs then found a great hookup for fent patches (10 gel 100mcg/hr patches for $160) and started taking m'dones instead of oxy's/hydro's since they lasted way longer. Also got a script for 120 dones so I'd make the patches last about 15 days then I'd make the 120 dones last the rest of the month 'til my guy got his patches again. I stayed well (and usually high) for about $200-250 a month. Then, at 26, I moved to New Orleans and started doing heroin whenever I ran out of patches and 'dones. I also took suboxone every now and then if I couldn't get anything else. Since then, I've either gone to a methadone clinic or been strung out on IV dope or paid $7-8 for 10mg 'dones if I was too far away from the closest clinic and didn't want to do dope. Currently going to a clinic and taking 160mg's a day but I still crave IV fentadope.  ",1

There was a particular opioid, called oxycontin, which the maker heavily marketed as being non-addictive. Not surprisingly, it's super addictive. This led to a very powerful and highly addictive medication being given out like candy for things where you don't really need a painkiller that heavy (think like a strained muscle, or wisdom tooth removal). 

People got addicted. People started getting prescriptions and selling them on the black market to people who are addicted once they couldn't get prescriptions any more. Because this is a powerful medication, people overdosed and died. Or, they couldn't afford to buy the medication, so they turned to heroin, which has similar effects. It's even easier to OD on heroin. But dealers started lacing the heroin with fentanyl---which is a SUPER powerful opioid. Fentantyl is 50-100x more powerful than morphine, ingesting only a few grains can kill you.

 Ao ser perguntado sobre quais seriam essas frases, PiÃ±era citou: ""Quem procura osso Ã© cachorro"", uma das que estampavam os cartazes de protesto de grupos de direitos humanos que pediam que [Bolsonaro deixasse o Chile.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/bolsonaro-ira-ao-chile-para-esvaziar-de-vez-orgao-internacional-criado-por-lula.shtml)

 Nos dois dias oficiais da visita, houve protestos contra o brasileiro, do lado de fora do[ palÃ¡cio de La ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/opiniao/2019/03/mais-perto-do-chile.shtml)[Moneda](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/opiniao/2019/03/mais-perto-do-chile.shtml) e em outros pontos da cidade, por parte de estudantes, organizaÃ§Ãµes de direitos humanos e feministas. A isso, Bolsonaro respondeu, ao chegar, que ""protestos assim existem onde quer que eu vÃ¡, mas o importante Ã© que, no meu paÃ­s, fui eleito por milhares de brasileiros"".

 PiÃ±era disse que frases como a que citou ""sÃ£o tremendamente infelizes"". ""NÃ£o compartilho muito do que Bolsonaro diz sobre o tema.""

 Na mesma ocasiÃ£o, PiÃ±era voltou a [defender o ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/paises-sul-americanos-criam-bloco-para-pressionar-venezuela.shtml)[Prosul](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/paises-sul-americanos-criam-bloco-para-pressionar-venezuela.shtml), [bloco criado em Santiago](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/vem-ai-onda-de-transformacoes-que-pode-nos-arrastar-diz-pinera-em-cupula.shtml) na sexta-feira (22) e reafirmou nÃ£o ser um bloco ""de paÃ­ses de direita"". Disse que respeita a decisÃ£o de Uruguai e BolÃ­via de nÃ£o assinar a declaraÃ§Ã£o conjunta neste momento, mas reforÃ§ou que ambos seguem sendo convidados a fazÃª-lo mais adiante. E que apenas a Venezuela ainda nÃ£o estÃ¡ convidada, ""por nÃ£o cumprir com o requisito de ser um paÃ­s democrÃ¡tico e com respeito aos direitos humanos"", mas espera que essa fase logo passe, apÃ³s o fim da ditadura de NicolÃ¡s Maduro.

""NÃ£o estamos agrupando a direita, e sim os paÃ­ses democrÃ¡ticos"", concluiu. Sobre sua prÃ³pria orientaÃ§Ã£o polÃ­tica, disse que prefere ser identificado hoje com ""uma centro-direita mais diversa, mais tolerante, mais moderna e sintonizada com a cidadania"".

 No ano passado, logo apÃ³s a vitÃ³ria de Bolsonaro, PiÃ±era disse que o brasileiro havia obtido ""uma enorme vitÃ³ria"", algo que voltou a repetir publicamente, em tom elogioso, no Ãºltimo sÃ¡bado (23).

 PorÃ©m, em 2018, o mandatÃ¡rio chileno tambÃ©m disse ter ""discrepÃ¢ncias profundas em algumas Ã¡reas e coincidÃªncias importantes em outras"". Entre as coincidÃªncias, mencionou ""os temas de modernizaÃ§Ã£o da economia e de recuperaÃ§Ã£o de equilÃ­brios fiscais"".

 Ainda naquela ocasiÃ£o, PiÃ±era falou sobre as afirmaÃ§Ãµes consideradas racistas e homofÃ³bicas do brasileiro: ""Obviamente essas afirmaÃ§Ãµes sobre condutas homofÃ³bicas e pouco respeitosas com relaÃ§Ã£o Ã s mulheres sÃ£o afirmaÃ§Ãµes com as quais eu definitivamente nÃ£o estou de acordo"".

 PiÃ±era condena a ditadura pinochetista (1973-1990) e sempre fez questÃ£o de dizer que votou pelo ânÃ£oâ no plebiscito de 1989 que decidiu o fim do regime militar. JÃ¡ Bolsonaro fez [elogios pÃºblicos a pessoas como o coronel Carlos Alberto](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/11/1830577-bolsonaro-diz-que-ustra-e-heroi-em-sessao-de-seu-processo-de-cassacao.shtml) [Brilhante Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/11/1830577-bolsonaro-diz-que-ustra-e-heroi-em-sessao-de-seu-processo-de-cassacao.shtml) e, mais recentemente, [ao general Alfredo Stroessner](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/em-itaipu-bolsonaro-elogia-presidentes-militares-e-chama-ditador-paraguaio-de-estadista.shtml), ditador do Paraguai entre 1929 e 1989.

&gt;At border crossings, pot made up 300,000 pounds of the total 553,000 pounds found at both borders and coasts.

&gt;Other drugs, including **heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, and fentany**l, were seized in significantly lower quantities, and **more of those were found at ports**, not by Border Patrol.


It's a shame when an article trying to prove something wrong, accidentally proves it to be right. 


TL;DR: The dangerous drugs are *actually* coming through ports of entry and the wall ain't gonna fix that.

My RE told me after that they had the narcan out because I was on such high dose I was at risk of overdose. 

Having said all that - I do have friends who have had Egg retrievals and had totally different experiences than me : didn’t feel or remember anything. Everyone responds to pain meds differently and historically I’ve needed more to be at a comfortable level (like at the dentist for freezing). 

Now having said that - I’m a therapist so clients I’ve had through the years have told me stories that were similar to mine. That their dr underplayed the pain factor.

Heroina? No, zastosowanie w medycynie dość szerokie. Oczywiście znajdzie się wiele lepszych substancji niż diamorfina do osiągania danych rezultatów, jednak jak najbardziej opiaty w wielu przypadkach są używane.

123,2019-03-22 21:03:12+00:00,"This really speaks to me.. 

TLDR; This prophecy directly correlates to how my life has gone so far.

Here’s a little backstory,
I grew up really confused as to how the system here worked on earth. I didn’t understand the pain I was feeling around me and within me. I was depressed, had insomnia, and was in a cycle of pain. But being in this mindset I was able to offer those around me a shoulder to cry upon and attempt to heal. I read up on anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc. I learned how our thoughts twist reality. I changed my perspective.

 I then went on to delve into the realm of science because that seemed like the next step. Since science was a concept aimed at understanding the world around us. My knowledge of the physical world grew but it felt like something was missing. As I started to read about quantum physics I realized you can’t leave out the observer. I ended up looking deeply into predeterminism and the concept of free will. Searching for a way out, the answer. 

I found out western science is just a belief, a different perspective/model that didn’t cover the whole picture. That’s when I found out about the spiritual world and how for the most part my peers were blinded by lies told to them saying none of that spiritual mumbo jumbo was real. I became obsessed with finding a way to unite the two systems and ended up making my senior project “an attempt at unifying science and mysticism”
What I found was the spiritual world was grounded in experiences and it was hard to provide clear evidence of correlation even though to me the connections seemed clear. Ended up scrapping the idea and opted to make my project a summary of esoteric ideas and how they could be connected and letting my peers find out themselves if they wished. I ended up getting a public speaking award and my whole class was talking about it for weeks afterwards.
After I graduated I went back to a sleep state. I wasted my time partying with friends and having no real direction. The two things I wanted in my life was love and to travel the world. I kept up meditating and would take psychedelics every now and then. 

Till on my birthday Oct 20th 2018 (in numerology it boils down to five) I had an epiphany, I realized I was sleeping and needed to promptly leave my little home town island in Alaska to go explore. I bought a plane ticket that day to Seattle. Packed up a hiking bag with some clothes, sleeping bag, and the intention I was going to learn something on this trip. I had five hundred bucks to my name and my goal was to get to St. Louis Missouri where a friend of mine told me he had a cool pad and a job lined up for me. Figured I’d hitchhike my way on over since there was nothing for me at home. 

On this journey I found out I was living in a bubble up in Alaska. There were so many people suffering in the streets not able to get jobs, or hell even food or water.. made me think why is it that we didn’t rise as a whole? Why don’t we worry about those who don’t have shelter, food and water? Why was the government so greedy? Why did the 1% hold all this money they weren’t even using? Wouldn’t we be better off if we made sure everyone on earth had food, shelter and water? Ya know build a foundation before you build a pyramid.

As my journey progressed I came to appreciate all of the kind souls that gave me rides or offered me food. In turn I told them my stories living up in Alaska. That seemed to be a big selling point. Skipping over the fluff, I learned that I had this power to do anything I wanted. I remember my friends telling me you’re f***ing crazy for trying to hitchhike in the winter what’re you thinking? To which I replied I don’t know? I’m simply doing. 

I made it to St. Louis where my friend was addicted to fentayl.. an opiate that’s 50% more potent than heroin and a lot cheaper.. also found out he had broken up with his gf and that I was the only person he had in his life because he didn’t have a strong connection with any of his family and he had no other friends. I remember him answering the door and telling me “oh man Hank you showed up at the worst of times” to which I replied “on the contrary my friend I do believe I showed up at the right time” 
I had a profound experience the month and a half I was there. I was working 7 days a week 8-5 coming home finding my friend laying in bed just how I left him that morning. It’s like he was dying. I spent my off hours doing the chores around the house and trying to mend my friends mental wounds. 
I was able to connect with him very deeply and found I was looking at an earlier version of myself. One who had gone through a breakup, got depressed and turned to alcohol (same time as when I was depressed, and had insomnia). I found that seeing myself in him I was able to say all the correct words. And I believe those words gave me the closure to fully heal those old wounds of mine.
I got my friend to go to rehab, got his family involved and seeing as my work was done I went back to Alaska feeling I had accomplished what I was meant to do. 

Time flew by and before I knew it I had already been back in Alaska for a month my friend back in St. Louis was still acting weird. And wasn’t realizing he was twisting reality to fit how he felt inside. He was projecting hatred, and the attitude “the world is against me”. He was chronically lying and contorting other people’s words to match his twisted perspective. Eventually I had to close off communication with him. 
Afterwards strange things happened to me. I kept seeing 555 everywhere I went. My intuition was off the charts and I felt this connection with everything around me. It was almost intoxicating, I had become high on life it seemed. In this time a lot of childhood trauma had come to my attention to. A lot of stuff I must’ve blocked out at some point. What was weird was the moment would come up and I’d have intense feelings of anxiety, sadness, and anger then as quick as they had come the feeling was gone and I felt uplifted. 

It was then I realized that journey down south wasn’t about my friend but about providing me the experiences I needed to heal. And wake up. From that point onward I’ve felt this disassociation with the body, and a greater connection with a higher purpose. Almost as if I remembered that my purpose here is to send out love and guide those to searching within and finding what’s hidden in plain sight. 

When I read this post I felt instantly connected. Wether I am this young lad the prophecy speaks of or just a pawn in the big equation I’m glad to be hear to experience and can’t wait till I perfect my healing abilities and find a platform to project myself. Teaching and healing all those willing to listen.
Lots of love and light for any that read my story! I wish you find your path.",1

I have witnessed the horrors of addiction first hand as my mother was an opioid addict that got hooked on them after she blew her knee out at work and was prescribed them. There are a lot of good people fighting addiction. Now with opioids a lot of addiction came from over medication and in the example of Central Appalachia, Perdue Drug Company used the area as a test market for Oxycotin to see what the negative effects of the drug would have on people and they knew exactly what it would do. They used my people without their consent in their fucking fucked up experiment and has essentially killed some of the more close knit communities in this country in the process, while paying doctors in the area to do it by giving incentives and payouts to them for prescribing the drug. Again this isn't a conspiracy and again is public knowledge. The courts have ruled, I believe, everytime against Perdue when they have been sued by the states and some individuals. My mother actually got her rehab and what not paid for as a result of one of the lawsuits.

And I absolutely understand where they're coming from. 

As a for instance, the FDA approved Merck's Vioxx, and it took 150 000 heart attacks and the deaths of around 60 000 people to get the drug pulled from the market. Meanwhile it turned out that Merck hid post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA that showed a link between Vioxx and heart disease.

So while Merck was actively hiding evidence of excessive harm, they were also actively conducting safety trials for Gardasil. Vioxx got pulled in 2004  and Gardasil was approved just 2 years later. 

How the fuck is the average, rational person supposed to believe that the drug division of Merck is full of venal psychopaths, while the vaccine division is simultaneously full of altruist angels? 

People who don't trust vaccine safety have every reason not to IMO. 

Here's a [list of the 20 largest Pharmaceutical settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_pharmaceutical_settlements). Recognize any of those names? A lot of them manufacture vaccines, of course.

So what is a rational interpretation of this situation? Drug companies have been shown repeatedly to put profits over people (sometimes with disastrous effects--Ocycontin anyone?), so why on earth should we trust them when they say their vaccines are safe?

I know the pro-vaccine answer is that the science says they're safe, but who's science was it?

 Confira, abaixo, recuos e derrotas do superministro de Bolsonaro.

      

**Decreto das armas**  
 Seu primeiro revÃ©s foi ainda em janeiro. O ministro tentou se desvincular da autoria da ideia de [flexibilizar a posse de armas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/01/bolsonaro-assina-decreto-que-flexibiliza-posse-de-armas-no-pais.shtml), dizendo nos bastidores estar apenas cumprindo ordens do presidente. Teve sua sugestÃ£o ignorada de limitar o registro por pessoa a duas armas âo decreto fixou o nÃºmero em quatro

 **Laranjas**  
 No caso do escÃ¢ndalo de [candidaturas de laranjas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/entenda-as-evidencias-e-as-versoes-dos-envolvidos-em-esquema-de-laranjas-do-psl.shtml), enquanto Moro deu declaraÃ§Ãµes evasivas, dizendo que a PF iria investigar se âhouvesse necessidadeâ e que nÃ£o sabia se havia consistÃªncia nas denÃºncias, Bolsonaro determinou dias depois, de forma enfÃ¡tica, [a abertura de investigaÃ§Ãµes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/bolsonaro-manda-pf-investigar-laranjas-e-diz-que-bebianno-pode-voltar-as-origens.shtml) para apurar o esquema

 **Ilona SzabÃ³**  
 Moro teve de [demitir a especialista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/02/moro-recua-de-nomeacao-de-especialista-em-seguranca-publica-para-conselho.shtml) em seguranÃ§a pÃºblica por determinaÃ§Ã£o do presidente, apÃ³s repercussÃ£o negativa da nomeaÃ§Ã£o. Ilona SzabÃ³ jÃ¡ se disse contrÃ¡ria [ao afrouxamento das regras de acesso a armas](https://saidapeladireita.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/02/27/nomeacao-de-ilona-szabo-por-moro-enfurece-a-direita-pro-armas/) e criticou a ideia de ampliaÃ§Ã£o do direito Ã legÃ­tima defesa que estÃ¡ no projeto do ministro

 **Caixa dois**  
 Por ordem do PalÃ¡cio do Planalto, [a proposta de criminalizaÃ§Ã£o do caixa dois](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/bolsonaro-assina-pacote-anticrime-de-moro-e-medidas-irao-ao-congresso-nesta-terca-feira.shtml), elaborada pelo ministro da JustiÃ§a, vai tramitar separadamente do restante do [projeto anticrime](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/entenda-os-principais-pontos-do-pacote-anticrime-de-moro.shtml)

 **Projeto anticrime**  
 Na Ãºltima semana, o presidente da CÃ¢mara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), [travou o pacote ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/maia-diz-que-projeto-de-moro-e-copia-e-cola-e-que-ministro-confunde-as-bolas.shtml)[anticrime](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/maia-diz-que-projeto-de-moro-e-copia-e-cola-e-que-ministro-confunde-as-bolas.shtml) na Casa ao determinar a criaÃ§Ã£o de um grupo de trabalho para analisar a proposta e outras duas correlatas. Como o grupo tem o prazo de 90 dias para debater as matÃ©rias, a decisÃ£o de Maia suspende, na prÃ¡tica, a tramitaÃ§Ã£o da maior parte do pacote

It’s like saying guns are dangerous but making people preoccupied with misfires.

Since it’s not studied &amp; taboo to talk about there is a very poor understanding about what opioid use and abuse actually looks like.

Some is the specifics of opioids

Speedballing: stimulant wears off first &amp; you stop breathing

Shooting: a much more certain path to abuse, made worse by variable potency when you try and take your big shot.

Rehab rollercoaster: getting clean &amp; dirty removes your tolerance &amp; not having your ear to the ground means you’ll be ignorant of potency trends.

Last shot. Lot’s of people OD trying to blast off before rehab.

If you have to abuse opioids, don’t shoot. Plug or snort or even smoke, don’t go overboard on your first taste of new bag/plug. Have narcan, it’s pretty widely available &amp; look out for shallow/distressed breathing. Volumetric dosing will protect you from hot spots of fentantyl. Fent &amp; other reagent tests are available.

Drugs are most dangerous when you are using them to cope with bad feelings. If you are abusing drugs, try reading lost connections by Johann Hari. Having some protective features of a healthy life will help a lot when/if you do want to get clean. The idea you need to or should hit rock bottom is idiotic.

Timothy Dalton enters the the bathroom and seductively begins to unzip Jen Connelly's dress.

169,2019-03-20 00:24:06+00:00,"First off let me say how sorry I am to hear that this happened. I have a brother and I don't know what I would do if he died. In 1994 I overdosed on heroin and was in a coma for 3 days on life support. They didn't know if I would ever wake up. I did and after spending 10 days in hospital my older brother took me home to his house. When we got there he broke down and told me how scared he was that I was going to die and that he loved me. That was enough to keep me clean for 7 years.

Anyway, coke can cause insomnia and paranoia. That's what your brother might have been experiencing. It's possible he took some methadone and mixed it with Xanax or another benzodiazipine. Methadone by itself is safe but when combined with other drugs like Xanax it can cause respiratory depression. That might have happened.

Also, there have been reports on the east coast of cocaine testing positive for fentenyl. It's possible he got some coke mixed with deadly fent.

Ultimately does it really matter what happened? Don't drive yourself crazy trying to figure it out instead don't let your brother's death to be in vain. Do something in his memory. Setup some kind of help in his name. Use your story to tell other people in the same situation. You could maybe make that difference in someone's life that makes them change so someone else doesn't have to go through what you went through. Maybe volunteer at a drug rehab or something. Use this opportunity to help someone else or many people.

I hope you one day find the solace you are searching for. ",1

But again, I hate the police. I don't hate individual police officers.

I feel the medical industry is very tied up into keeping the US from a single payer system. I also feel the medical industry is tied into to treating symptoms while avoiding things that cause them. 

Granted, big pharma (and big lawyers with med malpractice suits) and the overall capitalist neoliberal system all play a part.

But to deny AMA/Doctor complicity in the whole deal? I think our oxycotin  epidemic is just one thing that shows the falsity of that.

Doctors are 100% NOT the ONLY problem with medicine. They're just one factor that is complicit in the system. 

While I don't agree with the summary, and I certainly am not a fan of the Austrian school of economics, I think this article: https://mises.org/library/100-years-medical-robbery  does have some facts that can be extrapolated, that back up what I'm trying to articulate.

 A preocupaÃ§Ã£o Ã© de que, por se tratar da primeira celebraÃ§Ã£o da data no [governo Jair Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/) (PSL) âcapitÃ£o reformado e [simpÃ¡tico ao perÃ­odo da ditadura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/03/1430637-alves-derruba-pedido-de-jair-bolsonaro-para-homenagear-golpe-de-1964.shtml) (1964-85)â, as manifestaÃ§Ãµes extrapolem os muros dos quartÃ©is e batalhÃµes e ganhem os espaÃ§os pÃºblicos, tensionando ainda mais o clima polÃ­tico.

 O receio surgiu apÃ³s terem chegado a auxiliares do governo informaÃ§Ãµes sobre a intenÃ§Ã£o de serem promovidas festividades maiores do que em anos anteriores para comemorar a efemÃ©ride, como em escolas de formaÃ§Ã£o e em clubes militares.

 A cÃºpula militar defende nos bastidores que se repita a discriÃ§Ã£o verificada nos Ãºltimos anos, sem haver, como definiram assessores presidenciais em conversas reservadas, âconfeteâ, âserpentinaâ ou âcarnavalâ. E que ânÃ£o se crie marolaâ sobre o assunto, nas palavras de um deles, ofuscando a reforma da PrevidÃªncia, considerada a prioridade da atual gestÃ£o.

 âÃ o primeiro 31 de MarÃ§o sob a Ã©gide do governo de Jair Bolsonaro. Espera-se que haja algum tipo de comemoraÃ§Ã£o, digamos assim, mas ela serÃ¡, obviamente, intramurosâ, disse Ã **Folha** o vice-presidente, general Hamilton MourÃ£o.

 As ForÃ§as Armadas discutem a expediÃ§Ã£o de uma diretriz sobre a memÃ³ria da data, que, embora tenha comemoraÃ§Ã£o considerada controversa, Ã© valorizada e lembrada pela classe militar como um fato histÃ³rico relevante para o paÃ­s.

 Neste ano, ao menos trÃªs estabelecimentos militares incluÃ­ram a efemÃ©ride em seus calendÃ¡rios, divulgados em suas pÃ¡ginas na internet, como o dia da âRevoluÃ§Ã£o DemocrÃ¡tica de 1964â: a Escola PreparatÃ³ria de Cadetes do ExÃ©rcito, o Comando de OperaÃ§Ãµes Terrestres e o ColÃ©gio Militar de Santa Maria. No Clube Militar do Rio de Janeiro, foi marcado um almoÃ§o em homenagem aos 55 anos.

 Desde 1965, o episÃ³dio costuma ser recordado no dia 31 de marÃ§o em unidades militares. A partir de 2003, com a chegada de Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva (PT) ao PalÃ¡cio do Planalto, a lembranÃ§a passou a ser feita, no entanto, de maneira mais discreta.

 ApÃ³s a eleiÃ§Ã£o de Dilma Rousseff (PT), a data foi retirada do calendÃ¡rio de comemoraÃ§Ãµes do ExÃ©rcito, mas clubes militares continuaram a homenageÃ¡-la. Em 2011, segundo noticiou a **Folha**, foi cancelada palestra que o hoje ministro-chefe do Gabinete de SeguranÃ§a Institucional, general [Augusto Heleno](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/05/clamor-por-intervencao-militar-e-semelhante-ao-de-1964-diz-general-da-reserva.shtml), faria sobre a data, intitulada âA contrarrevoluÃ§Ã£o que salvou o Brasilâ.

 Na Ã©poca, em carta ao jornal, ele disse que a fala nÃ£o iria âferir os princÃ­pios da hierarquia e da disciplinaâ. âMinhas palavras nÃ£o iriam modificar os fatos, apenas contar a verdade aos mais jovensâ, afirmou.

 Com a vitÃ³ria de Bolsonaro, generais de alta patente avaliam agora reincluir a data na programaÃ§Ã£o oficial do ExÃ©rcito. Procurado pela **Folha**, o MinistÃ©rio da Defesa disse, por meio de sua assessoria de imprensa, que por enquanto ""nÃ£o dispÃµe de informaÃ§Ãµes a respeito"".

 Preocupada com manifestaÃ§Ãµes pÃºblicas, a deputada federal PerpÃ©tua Almeida (PC do B-AC) reuniu-se com o ministro da Defesa, general Fernando Azevedo e Silva. Na audiÃªncia, marcada para discutir diferentes temas, ela disse ter relatado a ele que recebeu informaÃ§Ãµes de que havia animaÃ§Ã£o em unidades militares para a data e que nÃ£o seria conveniente uma âcomemoraÃ§Ã£o extramurosâ.

 âEle concordou que nÃ£o hÃ¡ necessidade de criar novas tensÃµes no paÃ­sâ, disse a parlamentar de esquerda.

 Para o lÃ­der do PT no Senado, Humberto Costa (PE), Ã© da responsabilidade do governo federal e dos comandos militares desestimularem comemoraÃ§Ãµes pÃºblicas que podem, na avaliaÃ§Ã£o dele, aumentar a polarizaÃ§Ã£o polÃ­tica no paÃ­s.

 âEu acho que isso seria muito ruim, porque pode adicionar uma complicaÃ§Ã£o maior a esse ambiente que jÃ¡ Ã© muito tensoâ, disse.

 Apesar do receio da cÃºpula militar, a expectativa Ã© de que o presidente se manifeste, nem que seja pelas redes sociais, em homenagem Ã data. Para auxiliares palacianos, na tentativa de evitar crÃ­ticas da opiniÃ£o pÃºblica, seria ideal que, no mesmo posicionamento, ele fizesse uma defesa da democracia.

 No ano passado, no dia da efemÃ©ride, Bolsonaro publicou vÃ­deo no Facebook em que aparecia estourando um rojÃ£o em frente ao MinistÃ©rio da Defesa, acompanhado de uma faixa que agradecia os militares por nÃ£o terem permitido que o Brasil se transformasse em Cuba. âO 7 de Setembro nos deu a independÃªncia e o 31 de MarÃ§o, a liberdadeâ, disse.

 Em sua trajetÃ³ria polÃ­tica como deputado federal, ele fez inÃºmeros elogios Ã ditadura no paÃ­s e chamou de [âherÃ³i brasileiroâ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/11/1830577-bolsonaro-diz-que-ustra-e-heroi-em-sessao-de-seu-processo-de-cassacao.shtml) o coronel [Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/tse-suspende-propaganda-do-pt-que-mostra-bolsonaro-elogiando-ustra.shtml), um dos principais sÃ­mbolos da repressÃ£o durante o regime militar, morto em 2015.

 Ustra comandou o [DOI-Codi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/12/dna-identifica-militante-morto-em-unidade-chefiada-por-heroi-de-bolsonaro.shtml) (Destacamento de OperaÃ§Ãµes de InformaÃ§Ãµes) do 2Âº ExÃ©rcito entre 1970 e 1974, no auge do combate Ã s organizaÃ§Ãµes da esquerda armada. Segundo o [relatÃ³rio final da ComissÃ£o Nacional da Verdade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/12/1560369-acesse-a-integra-do-relatorio-final-da-comissao-nacional-da-verdade.shtml), sÃ³ em sua gestÃ£o, a unidade militar foi responsÃ¡vel pela morte ou desaparecimento de ao menos 45 presos polÃ­ticos.

He has two warrants in two states for dui on his motorcycle he got during his moms convalescence. He had within the previous year buried his mom(and had ODed her on her mophine to expedite the last days of her slow cancer death which was destroying him, but it fucked up his head worse). We buried a “brother(a mutual friend of 25-30 years)” a few months before this conversation of liver failure from all the partying he did. My only response I could think of was “take care of your legal problems, the invisible weight that will lift will feel great and if you still feel the same way.... and that’s fucked dude, don’t, you know how much the rest of us will miss you”, and as I was saying that I realized that was selfish of me, to make him continue on living a life he just is so tired of so I don’t have to lose another friend. I’d rather he went on antidepressants again and felt less hopeless, but that’s something I’ve never done no matter what I feel.

Worse, Purdue did market research that showed that doctors would choose Oxycotin over other opioids only if it was shown to be non-addicting.  So despite knowing it was every bit as addicting as other opioids, they produced product literature and had sales representatives telling doctors that it wasn't addicting.   ",1

I mean, seriously.  

Perdue (ultimately the owning company) has access to everything - all research, all patents, everything stops at there doorstep.

Because of there access to this information a very strong argument can be made that they might be in the best position of any company to make an 'overdose antidote' (whatever the fuck that means).

Does our country have a problem with opiods???? YEP.

Has Oxycotin made the problem worse??? Would seem that way.

You would prefer to wait LONGER for a better drug to come to market then have Perdue ultimatly holding the patents for this drug?

Is that really what you want to happen??

I mean, you can argue that they should be ashamed to be making money off the antidote, that they should be giving it away for free.  You can argue that maybe congress could strip them of the patents and make all of this public domain.

But, to argue - which is exactly what you are arguing - that they should not be permitted to do this reasearch and bring this drug to market is to argue that you are fine with people dying and suffering just as long as it means Perdue can't make money.

I am not fine with that.

(Long ""me, me, me"" monologue ahead XD)


If I have a terminal disease, I'll  wrap up the book or story that I'm writing into whatever organic ending point I can spin out of thin air (rather I'll sit down in an imaginary room with my characters, tell them I'm dying, and ask them to work together to create a meaningful ending to whatever it is that's my life's work at that moment.  Seriously, I do the imaginary meeting exercise often and it's so... wholesome, in an indescribable way.)

I'll choose three things from my bucketlist to do, spend meaningful days with family and friends, write everyone a personal letter to be handed out after my funeral, spend a lengthy time in a Buddhist dharma (community in a convent or monastery) as lay participant, pilgrimage to Jerusalem (I'm an unbaptized believer. Oh, right, add a baptism in Jerusalem to the list)

And then just find some quiet place to peacefully stop living, I guess. Can you call it suicide when you can barely call the future 'life' anymore? 


Maybe Mt. Everest. All you have to do is stay at the summit for a little too long. I have Raynaud's syndrome, though, so yikes that'd be HELL. Soooo... Maybe not Everest then. 

Plus, my country has The Dutch Foundation for Voluntary Life Ending. I don't know that much about them, only that they are willing to re-evaluate cases that psychiatrists have rejected. If your case is accepted, you can choose an injection administered by medical staff or a liquid you can take yourself. 

My only gripe would be that it's done inside the facility. Surrounded by stereotypical bright green walls or in a carefully cultivated garden is not where I'd want to be. 

Now before y'all worry because I have this entire plan written out: I'm one of the few people that was born with clinical depression, which is also the main reason why I didn't get treatment until an off-label prescription (meaning a medicine is essentially prescribed for one of its side-effect on something it's not 'marketed' for, if you really think about it) depressants made me realize that there was a different way to feel.

If you read the article you linked, you will see this is not about fear mongering. It is about confusion in data collection practices. 

""The answer to crazed people isn’t to disarm everyone.""

1: They're not ""crazed people"". They're everyday Conservatives that have been radicalized by the present Administration and the rhetoric of the Republican party to an alarming degree.
2: It is justifiable to ""disarm everyone"" when the incidents happen with sufficient frequency that a response is necessary, which is the case. Especially when there's no justification for people to be owning what are essentially really dangerous toys for them to play with. 

""It’s not a straw man, it’s a question that you won’t answer. Why are you not disturbed by such a huge falsification of data?""

Is is a strawman. 
1: It's not falsification of data. It's just shit data collection practices because the department of education is a shit organization. The article clearly calls out that it is shit data collection practices. 
What the Gun lobbyists do is falsification.

2: My personal opinion is they should correct the methodology for the required questionnaires to alleviate the issue. But as I have said multiple times, we have sufficient qualified evidence to confirm a chronic problem that justifies a response. Especially when no harm is actually committed by taking away the specific type of weaponry in question. New Zealand took immediate action and there response was justifiable.

""What use are studies if they aren’t accurate?""

That one? Not a hell of a lot. But we (un)fortunately have a sufficient amount of demonstrable data on actual mass shootings both in schools or otherwise, that justify a response.

If you want accurate studies, then tell the gun lobbyists to stop preventing them. Once they're done, I'm pretty confident that weapons manufacturers will be open to lawsuit based on the results, similar to what has happened with Oxycotin and the big tobacco. ",1

All that articles does is confirm that school reporting/ data gathering on shooting incidents is poor. Regardless of that, we still know that many school shootings HAVE occurred, many of them massacres. If I'm at a plant and I see the incident report rate is at 115 but the confirmed incidents is only 25, I'm still going to address the issue causing the incidents, it doesn't get a pass.

No harm is inflicted on anyone due to the poor reporting of schools on the number of shooting related incidents that happen when we have a sufficient quantity of confirmed incidents that show clearly that there is an issue with guns in America.
In that context, any attempt to block/ hide/ prevent research into how guns impact the health of American citizens, like with Oxycotin, becomes worthy of litigation because that malfeasance leads to direct harm to the public.


If alcohol companies were to advertise in a fashion that suggested operating a car while drinking was good, then they'd be responsible. 
But alcohol companies are proactive in promoting a ""don't drink and drive"" message. They have been proactive in supporting the pursuit of the research that shows it is not safe to drink and drive.

Gun lobbyists and manufacturers have done the opposite.

227,2019-03-16 21:00:52+00:00," Ã Ã©poca presidente da Venezuela, Hugo ChÃ¡ves decidiu reabrir o tÃºmulo de [SimÃ³n BolÃ­var](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/762320-venezuela-homenageia-amante-de-simon-bolivar-heroi-da-independencia.shtml) faz quase dez anos. A ideia era retirar amostras de DNA para reconstituir os traÃ§os do militar, que auxiliou no processo de descolonizaÃ§Ã£o da AmÃ©rica Latina no inÃ­cio do sÃ©culo 19.

 Vendo a empreitada do governante, a artista Deborah Castillo decidiu: queria fazer o mesmo. NÃ£o era exatamente um procedimento cientÃ­fico, mas o que a performer buscou era fazer tambÃ©m um gesto iconoclasta. Em sua performance âO Beijo Emancipadorâ, ficava frente a frente de um reluzente busto dourado de BolÃ­var. Punha-se a acariciar a imagem do libertador, depois a beijÃ¡-la, lambÃª-la com ternura.

 O trabalho e a mostra em que foi realizado em 2013, em Caracas, acabaram censurados pelo governo. âFui denunciada em um canal do Estado, como se eu fosse a profanadora da pÃ¡tria, como se estivesse faltando com respeito ao pai da pÃ¡triaâ, diz a artista, hoje aos 48. âEu nÃ£o tenho nada a dizer sobre BolÃ­var como pessoa, mas, sim, sobre o que o governo chavista fez com a sua imagem. EntÃ£o eu eu tomo a imagem de BolÃ­var para desestabilizar e resistir ao sistema. Ã minha crÃ­tica Ã maneira como tomaram a imagem de BolÃ­var para dominar o povo.â

 No ano seguinte, Castillo decidiu deixar seu paÃ­s e desde entÃ£o vive em Nova York. Nunca mais voltou Ã Venezuela porque sente que nÃ£o tem liberdade de trabalhar lÃ¡. âNÃ£o sou uma exilada, sou uma deslocada. Queria estar na Venezuela, mas nÃ£o posso, senÃ£o perco a liberdade de expressÃ£o. Um dos problemas mais graves Ã© o desmantelamento do aparato cultural.â A Ãºnica maneira de ter uma mostra num museu ou numa instituiÃ§Ã£o oficial, segundo ela, Ã© fazer propaganda ao Estado.

 Parte da famÃ­lia ainda vive no paÃ­s, mas nem sempre consegue se comunicar com a artista. âA situaÃ§Ã£o no Ãºltimo ano piorou muito. Ãs vezes fico trÃªs dias sem conseguir falar com minha mÃ£e, eles passam uma semana [sem luz](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/como-funciona-o-sistema-de-energia-na-venezuela-e-por-que-entrou-em-colapso.shtml), Ã¡gua, internet. A Venezuela comeÃ§ou como um projeto socialista e hoje nÃ£o tem nada de socialista. O que tem de socialista um lugar em que as pessoas estÃ£o comendo lixo, bebendo Ã¡gua de esgoto? Ã uma humilhaÃ§Ã£o humana.â

 Mas nÃ£o Ã© apenas do sistema venezuelano que trata o trabalho de Castillo. Ela versa muito sobre o poder e o desejo e como muitas vezes os dois caminham juntos, se cruzam. âNÃ£o me interessa criticar a direita ou a esquerda, mas estudar, a partir da imagem, como essas estruturas de poder vÃ£o em paralelismo em estrutura. Os sistemas totalitÃ¡rios, nÃ£o importa onde sejam, sÃ£o opressores.â

 Como ela faz em âLamebrasil, Lamezuela - Questionamentos ao Poder na AmÃ©rica Latinaâ, performance que ela apresenta dentro da [MITsp - Mostra Internacional de Teatro de SÃ£o Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/peca-de-felipe-hirsch-escrita-por-alejandro-zambra-sera-um-dos-destaques-da-mitsp.shtml). Nela, ajoelha-se e lambe botas de militares, num gesto de obediÃªncia e desejo.

 Ainda que busque Ã­cones histÃ³ricos e figuras polÃ­ticas, o que faz em seu trabalho Ã© questionar a estrutura e a teatralidade do poder âmuitas vezes com humor negro, como faz em sua sÃ©rie de fotonovelas, em que cria situaÃ§Ãµes absurdas, de tom polÃ­tico. Como no mito de SÃ­sifo, que sobe a montanha com uma pedra e, jÃ¡ no topo, a deixa cair, ela critica como os governos latino-americanos nÃ£o dÃ£o continuidade a projetos de gestÃµes antigas, sempre partem do zero e nÃ£o dÃ£o espaÃ§o para desenvolvimentos sociais mais profundos.

 Mas muito, inevitavelmente, Ã© embebido de sua experiÃªncia venezuelana. âÃ como um amante tÃ³xicoâ, diz a artista. âNÃ³s, que estamos fora, ficamos angustiados pelos que estÃ£o dentro. Ã um duelo que vocÃª leva para onde vai.â

236,2019-03-16 01:01:59+00:00,"Hi. Long term lurker and have switched from Suboxone strips to Zubsolv to the old orange tablets then back to Zubsolv so I thought I'd pitch in my experience. 

I've been on Zubsolv 2 x 5.7/1.4 since getting out of rehab in 2016. In there it was all brand Suboxone strips. Zubsolv is supposed to have better absorption so 5.7/1.4 = 8/2 Suboxone. A guy in rehab told me about them. When I got out I decided not to taper and stay on bupe long term - maybe not forever but for a good long while. Why is another story. 

I don't remember if the doc wanted me to take Zubsolv or if it was the insurance company. Anyway, when the Suboxone strips rehab gave me on exit ran out, I switched to the  Zubsolv, and to be honest never noticed any difference. 

I was recently in the hospital for 15 days. Actually 2 different hospitals. I told them all the medications I am prescribed, including the Zubsolv. The first one put me on 10mg of Suboxone - an 8mg strip and a 2mg strip. I don't know how they arrived at that dose since 2 x 5.7/1.4 Zubsolv is supposed to be equal to 16mg of bupe. The dose reduction was not really a reduction because I only take 1 of those 5.7/1.4 Zubsolv a day. (My bupe doctor is over prescribing because of a clerical error on his part that he will not admit to. So, I have a nice amount set aside in case I ever get caught without a bupe doctor.)

When I got transfered, the second hospital gave me the old orange pills (still an 8mg and a 2mg). The 8mg orange tablets take forever to dissolve. I did get a mild headache the first day but that was it. When I got discharged, I went back to Zubsolv. Still never noticed any difference. 

I will mention that recovering from surgery while pretty much totally opiate blocked was an ""interesting"" experience. Even though I told them, and they were actively issuing 10mg of bupe per day, they still injected me with IV Fentanal and Dilaudid in pre-op (so they told me) and it had absolutely no effect. I asked the anesthesiologist if he used opiates in his drug regimen and he said yes. I said I hoped he had plenty of non-narcotic arrows in his quiver because I did not want to wake up in surgery (I didn't)!

That night, after surgery and post-op, back in my room, they injected morphine (don't know how much) and we're giving me 2 x 10mg Percosette every 4 hours. Nothing. It was a long night. Kind of guy off track but my point is, at least for me, switching from Suboxone to Zubsolv  to the orange tablets then back to Zubsolv never bothered me, other than a mild headache the first day they switched me to the orange tablets. I guess everyone is different. YMMV...",1

The point of the matter is, though, that except in individuals who have something else wrong in their life, that they're self-medicating for, marinuana is generally less of a ""gateway drug"" than prescription painkillers like Oxycotin and Vicodin are.

People smoking pot don't usually switch to pther drugs like Heroin for a ""stronger"" high as their body builds up a tolerance or dependence, because the type of high is different. And withdrawal - if such a thing exists for habitual pot smokers - tends to not be particularly damaging or potentially fatal, the way it can be on harder drugs (alcohol included).

We could also beef up satellite, drone, and sensor networks across the border which would be a far more cost effect means to police large expanses, than a wall that’s need maintenance and could be gone over, under, or through.

It's been made abundantly clear to me everytime I pick my medication up and have to play 20 questions with the pharmicist, or get approached by random strangers asking if I'm prescribed pain meds (I use various walking aids and have a limp so I guess that's an opening).

Nothing I said contradicts your statements here. In fact, the paragraph I just quoted from you was a direct result of pharmaceutical company's immoral practices. You have to put up with this interrogation BECAUSE of the backlash of what drug manufacturers did. Salesmen from the makers of oxycotin were going to doctor's offices and telling them that addiction was less of a severe threat than it was. They were basically telling doctors to prescribe more pain medication and selling the idea that the dangers of addiction were less than they were. They had charts. They had graphs. They took doctor's to lavish lunches and gave them gifts. It was a campaign they waged to change the thinking behind addiction. The change they wanted was increased sales.

The makers of oxycotin made a time release pill that was easily crushed and defeated. So, they were not selling time release pills. They were selling heroin and trying to make it easier to prescribe.

Furthermore, the makers of oxycotin sold their time released product as a 12 hour drug when it was actually an eight hour drug. The quicker a drug leaves your system, the more addictive it is. So, even people who took the drug under a prescribed method without crushing the pill were more likely to become addicted. They knew this. They sold it otherwise.

You’re entire argument about Stupidity and Malice is not true at all. Chance doesn’t give you a few wins and a few losses. That’s why they use the term chance, as it’s intention is to imply seemingly a probabilistic guess. Especially when the chance is a standard normalized curve, you can easily have a clear winner as long as one side is able to guess the outcome while the other is completely unaware of what’s happening.

This leads into you’re final point. Are we winning? We don’t have to be as long as the tides are turning in our favor.

 Lessa seria membro de uma organizaÃ§Ã£o criminosa formada por matadores de aluguel apelidada de EscritÃ³rio do Crime e ligada a milÃ­cias. A quadrilha foi revelada por [Orlando de ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/05/em-carta-do-presidio-ex-pm-nega-envolvimento-em-caso-marielle.shtml)[Curicica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/05/em-carta-do-presidio-ex-pm-nega-envolvimento-em-caso-marielle.shtml) em abril do ano passado, miliciano preso atÃ© entÃ£o apontado como assassino de Marielle e Anderson.  
   
 Segundo reportagem da revista [piauÃ­](https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/materia/a-metastase/?doing_wp_cron=1552422518.1120550632476806640625), o MinistÃ©rio PÃºblico suspeita que o EscritÃ³rio do Crime esteja envolvido em pelo menos 19 homicÃ­dios nÃ£o esclarecidos nos Ãºltimos 15 anos, cobrando entre R$ 200 mil e R$ 1 milhÃ£o por assassinato. Segundo Curicica, a Delegacia de HomicÃ­dios do Rio de Janeiro recebia R$ 200 mil por mÃªs para nÃ£o identificar os criminosos.

 ApÃ³s essa denÃºncia, a procuradora-geral da RepÃºblica, [Raquel ](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/raquel-dodge/index.shtml)[Dodge](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/raquel-dodge/index.shtml), criou uma forÃ§a-tarefa da PolÃ­cia Federal para acompanhar os rumos das investigaÃ§Ãµes no Rio.

 Ainda que deixemos de lado os possÃ­veis vÃ­nculos entre a famÃ­lia Bolsonaro e o EscritÃ³rio do Crime âevidenciados pela contrataÃ§Ã£o de familiares de Adriano MagalhÃ£es no gabinete de FlÃ¡vio, por exemploâ, o fato Ã© que as primeiras declaraÃ§Ãµes do presidente[ Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/) a respeito da prisÃ£o dos suspeitos de matar Marielle e Anderson minimizam a ligaÃ§Ã£o do crime com os grupos paramilitares, que, alÃ©m de controlar territÃ³rios e atividades econÃ´micas na zona oeste do Rio, estÃ£o intrincados em diversas esferas do poder pÃºblico. 

 Quando utiliza a ocasiÃ£o para indagar-se sobre um possÃ­vel mandante da [facada](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/09/bolsonaro-leva-facada-durante-ato-de-campanha-em-juiz-de-fora.shtml) que recebeu, Bolsonaro parece querer encobrir que a investigaÃ§Ã£o sobre os mandantes do assassinato de Marielle Ã© tambÃ©m uma investigaÃ§Ã£o sobre a milÃ­cia carioca e suas crescentes redes de influÃªncia e representaÃ§Ã£o no Estado.

 Parafraseando Auguste de Saint-Hilaire, um jornalista escreveu no Twitter que âou o Brasil acaba com a milÃ­cia ou a milÃ­cia acaba com o Brasilâ.

 A pressÃ£o da opiniÃ£o pÃºblica pelo esclarecimento do crime contra Marielle e Anderson Ã© certamente a maior oportunidade que jÃ¡ tivemos para desmontar essa âmetÃ¡stase sem controleâ que se instalou no Estado brasileiro âutilizando a metÃ¡fora feita por uma autoridade que participa das investigaÃ§Ãµes em declaraÃ§Ã£o Ã revista piauÃ­.

 A primeira etapa, que culminou nas prisÃµes dessa semana, aponta o caminho: um meticuloso trabalho de inteligÃªncia, a garantia de autonomia aos investigadores e o fiel cumprimento da lei.

I mean I can’t even put it into better words. I’m so proud of you and I am CHEERING YOU ON because this is EVERYTHING I believe in. Unfortunately, as someone who has used more substances than I can count on my hands, I have to say that most of them were fairly addictive. However, I also am a STRONG enthusiast of legalization/decriminalization/harm reduction and believe it would be truly beneficial to any part of the world seeing as drug addiction/drugs reach people of any age, sex, creed, class, color, culture, etc. There is no way to stop people from taking drugs just as we can’t stand humans from having sex. But as we produce condoms and other forms of contraceptive, we can also improve on providing those who simply are going through addiction a safe way to go through it. After all, I don’t have numbers, but I am positive that the amount of deaths surrounding unsanitary needles, areas, drugs laced with fatal other things, and overdoses are TOO. HIGH. providing purity kits, sterilization, clean needles/pipes, and education on proper usage could save tons of lives. To capitalize on your last point, though I have yet to face a drug charge, I am fully aware of the situation of overcrowding in our US prisons in large due to the non-violent drug offenders. Rehabilitation and education WORK. labeling someone a felon and throwing them into the world after 12 years behind bars with no GED puts them in a shitty place with no sense of equity. Looping back to one of your first questions, in the past I have used adderall, ambien, codeine, cocaine, xanax, Ritalin, oxycotin, hydrocodone, whipits, marijuana(if you count it), crystal, ketamine, benadryl (yea we know it wasn’t a bright idea), lsd, MDMA, and shrooms. 
as far as I can tell, lsd, MDMA, shrooms, and ketamine are the ones I’ve found to be “non addictive” I forget the word, I think it’s psychoactive? but yeah the drugs that have those properties aren’t addictive. So I suppose I could throw marijuana in there too but I do believe people can create their own mental dependency on it. Though I haven’t found myself truly addictive to any of the rest, I can most certainly say that cocaine and xanax have had me by the throat in my years. That being said, I am not speaking for the general public. Obviously many of the drugs I listed ARE addictive, I just haven’t found myself addicted to them. 

Again. Thank you. Please reach out to me if you have any updates. Like I said, you’re doing the work I’ve wanted to do my whole life and I wish I could frickin shake your hand about it. ",1

Isti takav uticaj bi imao film Klip, ali srecom po nase drustvo tesko je sranje, nikad nije postao popularan, i nikad nije se osetio njegov uticaj u drustvu. 

&gt;A i Vojna akademija jeste napravljena za promociju ali da li je većina odlučila da ode tim putem? Ne. Neko jeste sigurno ali ne većina.

Naravno nece sve, ali ostaje cinjenica da neke jesu zbog tog filma postale takve. Isto kao sto su postali zbog turbo-folka pocetkom 90tih. 

Nasa je sreca sto Klip nije imao isti uticaj na nasu kulturu samo zbog toga sto je film sranje pa nikad nije postao popularan.

Ne znam koji si ti Trainspotting gledao, ali film jeste PROTIV koriscenja heroina, NE ZA. Ne znam ko bi mogao da izvuce pouku da Trainspotting glorifikuje koriscenje heroina, sem ako ne vidis budjenje u stanu sa mrtvom bebom koja je umrla dok si bio uradjen kao neki super cilj u zivotu.

Trainspotting je bio dobar film protiv koriscenja heroina i odvukao je mlade od toga. Takodje je bio dobar film, razumljiv, nesto u cemu mozemo da se prepoznamo, postao je popularan i imao dobar uticaj u drustvu.

 Se jÃ¡ existiam evidÃªncias do [envolvimento dos dois presos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/03/pm-e-preso-por-suspeita-de-executar-marielle-franco.shtml) no caso, por que a PolÃ­cia Civil nÃ£o efetuou as prisÃµes antes? E, se nÃ£o existiam, a antecipaÃ§Ã£o compromete a obtenÃ§Ã£o de provas que possam levar Ã condenaÃ§Ã£o dos dois acusados?

 Essas sÃ£o questÃµes importantes, jÃ¡ que, em mÃ©dia, segundo [estimativa do FÃ³rum Brasileiro de SeguranÃ§a PÃºblica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/08/mortes-violentas-avancam-e-batem-novo-recorde-no-pais.shtml), a taxa de esclarecimento de homicÃ­dios cometidos no Rio de Janeiro em 2017 foi de 8,6%. Ou seja, menos de 1 a cada 10 casos de mortes no estado foram solucionados.

 Esse percentual Ã© quase trÃªs vezes inferior Ã mÃ©dia nacional, que atinge 24,7% de esclarecimentos. E, segundo declaraÃ§Ã£o do delegado Giniton Lages, titular da Delegacia de HomicÃ­dios, cerca de 80% desses casos sÃ³ foram resolvidos com apoio em testemunhas.

 O Rio de Janeiro esclarece poucos homicÃ­dios e depende demais de provas testemunhais. Por isso, chama mais ainda a atenÃ§Ã£o [o fato de que a PolÃ­cia Civil e o MinistÃ©rio PÃºblico terem anunciado que fizeram uso de modernas ferramentas e tecnologias](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/03/obsessao-por-personalidades-de-esquerda-motivou-morte-de-marielle-dizem-autoridades.shtml) como forma de contornar a nÃ£o-existÃªncia de testemunhas.

 Se a autoria dos crimes for confirmada pelo Poder JudiciÃ¡rio, essa investigaÃ§Ã£o abre uma profÃ­cua frente de trabalho para as polÃ­cias civis do paÃ­s todo.

 A investigaÃ§Ã£o criminal no Brasil precisa deixar de ser burocrÃ¡tica e cartorÃ¡ria e precisa passar a fazer uso intensivo de dados e de cruzamento de informaÃ§Ãµes provenientes de minucioso trabalho de compilaÃ§Ã£o e anÃ¡lise de evidÃªncias. As polÃ­cias brasileiras jÃ¡ tÃªm Ã disposiÃ§Ã£o recursos tecnolÃ³gicos e de perÃ­cia, bem como pessoal treinado para atuar em casos que exijam o processamento de grandes quantidades de dados.

Em vez de incentivar policiais a subirem morros para matar e morrer, um contrassenso perverso, precisamos incentivar a inovaÃ§Ã£o e a cooperaÃ§Ã£o.

 Entre as novas tÃ©cnicas existentes, o uso de metadados de aplicativos de mensagens, quando articulado, ajuda na identificaÃ§Ã£o de padrÃµes e de caminhos que eventuais suspeitos fazem no universo virtual e no mundo real (GPS, datas, logs etc.).

 Esses metadados nÃ£o sÃ£o facilmente apagÃ¡veis e nÃ£o estÃ£o sujeitos Ã criptografia dos aplicativos. A partir deles Ã© possÃ­vel identificar pessoas e, com autorizaÃ§Ã£o da JustiÃ§a, monitorar acessos e conteÃºdos de sistemas em nuvem e/ou baseados em provedores internacionais. NÃ£o hÃ¡ mais como passar incÃ³lume pelo mundo cibernÃ©tico.

 A mesma[ tecnologia que ameaÃ§a nossa privacidade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/09/redes-sociais-atrapalham-funcionamento-da-democracia-diz-historiador.shtml), quando bem utilizada, Ã© a tecnologia que pode solucionar crimes. Isso Ã© o que foi feito, segundo as autoridades. O episÃ³dio sugere ainda que as tecnologias foram usadas no bojo de uma operaÃ§Ã£o conjunta entre PolÃ­cia Civil e o MinistÃ©rio PÃºblico do Rio de Janeiro, o que merece elogios. Sem integraÃ§Ã£o e coordenaÃ§Ã£o, nem mesmo a mais avanÃ§ada tecnologia serÃ¡ eficiente.

 A prisÃ£o dos dois acusados de matar Marielle e Anderson estÃ¡ longe de encerrar um caso que Ã© emblemÃ¡tico na escalada da violÃªncia polÃ­tica e do impacto do Ã³dio e do ressentimento cultivado nos Ãºltimos meses no paÃ­s.

 Ela exige que as autoridades sejam muito cuidadosas em dizer que nÃ£o hÃ¡ mandantes para um crime tÃ£o bÃ¡rbaro. Se for verdade que agiram sozinhos, teremos dado mais um passo para cair no precipÃ­cio civilizatÃ³rio em que as redes sociais tÃªm nos incentivado a caminhar.

La Policía de Ecuador sacó este lunes 11 de marzo del 2019 de circulación 376 200 dosis de heroína tras un operativo policial en el que también se detuvo a dos ciudadanos de origen ecuatoriano que pretendían comercializar la droga en el mercado interno del país.

En la operación 'Silenciador' los agentes se incautaron de 11,28 kilos de heroína en la provincia de Carchi (norte), fronteriza con Colombia, que iban a bordo de una camioneta que seguía la ruta entre Ipiales (Colombia), Tulcán e Ibarra (Ecuador), donde iba a ser expendida, según un comunicado policial.Los policías dieron el alto al vehículo, de color blanco, y tras registrarlo encontraron 38 paquetes envueltos en aluminio que contenían 1 140 cápsulas con la sustancia estupefaciente.La droga se hallaba oculta en el interior del tubo de escape de la camioneta.La Policía detuvo a los dos ocupantes del vehículo, ambos de origen ecuatoriano y que no registraban antecedentes penales, identificados como Manuel Ramón B. C. y María Gabriela P. L.Tanto ellos como las evidencias obtenidas fueron puestas a órdenes de las autoridades competentes para llevar a cabo el trámite pertinente.De esta forma, según la Institución, el cuerpo policial logró sacar de circulación un total de 376200 dosis de heroína cuyo valor asciende a, aproximadamente, USD 141 075 . 

El operativo ""Silenciador"" fue ejecutado por la Policía de Ecuador a través de la Dirección Nacional Antinarcóticos y la Unidad Antinarcóticos de la Sub-zona Carchi.También este lunes, la Fiscalía de Ecuador confirmó el hallazgo de droga en una avioneta accidentada anoche en Montecristi, por donde sobrevolaba aparentemente sin los permisos correspondientes.""De lo que se ha logrado rescatar, por lo pronto, son 35.200 gramos"" presumiblemente de clorhidrato de cocaína, dijo el fiscal Marcelo Vásconez.Agentes del orden que acudieron al sitio reportaron que en el interior de la aeronave siniestrada se encontraban dos personas heridas, que fueron llevadas a una casa de salud para la respectiva atención médica.Un comunicado policial detalló que se desconoce la identidad de las personas, que se encuentran en custodia policial.

That aside, if there was a bigger study that showed dogs love their owners more than cats do, it would make sense and I'd accept it. Dogs are pack animals and have more use for oxycotin. Cats are more independent. It's just how they're biologically wired.

But there's also a couple genes at play that make a person react (or fail to react) to certain chemicals. There are people out there for whom opiates do nothing. My partner is one of them. He can't find pain meds that work (the closest he's gotten is using oxycodon with grapefruit juice, the grapefruit juice makes it stronger). It took something like $100 of alcohol to get him drunk (three bottles and five shots of various types of alcohol is usually how the story goes, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't be surprised if it would take even more now). He's just very resistant to any sort of mind-altering substance. Meanwhile I get tipsy off of a wine cooler x.x

326,2019-03-10 06:23:07+00:00,"&gt; And to suggest that by taking it appropriately as ordered you are at risk to get addicted is completely false.

Not everyone gets addicted, that is true. People with a family history of drug abuse combined with any trauma or untreated/undiagnosed mental illnesses are at much higher risk of getting hooked on opioids. 

Short term, this isn't likely to happen, but let's say you broke your back in a car accident; you're not paralyzed but you're in agony. But the accident happened months and months ago but you're still in a lot of pain, it's become chronic, so you go to your doctor and they decide to treat your pain with Oxycotin, the doctor doesn't know that you have a family history of addiction or that you have some trauma in your past. That first month is great! You're able to do everyday tasks and live a normal life again. A few months go by and slowly the meds stop working. You  start hurting so bad that you start to lose the ability to live normally again and ask your doctor to up the dose and he does. The cycle repeats: pain is managed for a while, then the body builds up tolerance and the doctor ups the dose. Soon you're crushing pills and taking doses that would kill a person with no tolerance. Your doctor decides they're cutting you off, you've become a liability because the dose you require to live a normal life is high enough that they could get flagged for over prescription. Since the doc isn't helping, you buy pills off the street. Soon enough because your tolerance is getting higher, you can't afford the pills anymore. You hear that heroin is like Oxy, but it's much cheaper. All you wanted was to not be in pain, the Oxy didn't just take away the physical pain, but the emotional pain of your past too, and when you stop all that pain comes rushing back along side withdrawals that make you violently ill.

I found a [video](https://youtu.be/NDVV_M__CSI) that you might find interesting. 

Once again, I want to reiterate that completely support using opioids for *shot term illness/injury*. We need a better option for *chronic* pain patients.",1

The issue arises when they are prescribed for chronic/life long issues. The longer you're on opioids, the higher the chance of addiction is.

(From the same source) ""OxyContin sales representatives visited doctors across the United States, leaving them with gifts, free patient samples, and invitations to all-expenses-paid symposia — all actions that are known to impact prescribing. The widespread adoption of opioids for pain relief was further facilitated by marketing strategies that downplayed OxyContin’s addictive potential and targeted primary care doctors, who continue to prescribe the majority of opioid pain relievers in many nations.""",1

Its hard to really know honestly. Maybe try getting fentanyl testing strips to test your shorting acting dope with.

Generally the actual high from more pure diactylmorphine shouldnt last too long for someone thats addicted and using it via IV. Its never lasted long for me honestly.

Outra coisa. Nem todo mundo que toma uma cerva no fds ou uma taca de vinho no jantar vira alcoolatra.

Mas todos que experimentam crack tornam se viciados prarlticamente incuraveis.

Aposto que vc deve fumae unzinho....

He did mention that he'd been very open about his use of it, and had told staff and other patients, etc. My guess is that someone heard that he was using The Marijuanas, assumed that meant he was smoking fat blunts in his hospital room, and called the cops.

There is so much wrong with this situation it's hard to even know where to begin, but one really striking irony to me is that this guy is exactly the kind of patient a hospital would typically pump full of fucking *morphene* without anyone batting an eyelid.. and here are the cop squad rummaging through all his shit over a rumor of some weed. There were probably at least 10 far harder drugs already in that room, all provided by the hospital.",1
347,2019-03-08 23:25:07+00:00,"Yes, but the profit incentives need to be in the right places.  

Right now it's more profitable to make insignificant changes to recycle a patent on a drug instead of actually making a new drug.  

Also, it's more profitable to do what a patient wants instead of what they need.  Doctors with low patient approval scores risk losing their jobs.  

Guess what lowers a patient's approval score? Telling them they're too fat and need to lose weight.  Asking them to try Ibprofen before going straight to Oxycotin.  Literally any orthopedic surgery due to a broken bone, because there's no such thing as going back to 100%.  

The insurance system has a huge profit incentive to maximize discounts, even if it means having the hospitals falsely maximize their billing rates so the brokers can say they got the discounts down another 5%.  This fucks over uninsured people who are now on the hospital's good graces to lower the bill voluntarily.  

Insurance companies have no profit incentive to do right by their insured because the insured aren't making the purchasing decisions: their bosses and HR department is.  Dead and dying don't complain about how their insurance company fucked them over to anyone that means anything because that's not how they want to spend their final days.  

Even then it would just be glossed over at the next annual benefits meeting where the Insurance salesman would promise ""it totally won't happen again"" or ""The other guys do it too, but worse"".  

Furthermore, Healthcare doesn't play by free market rules.  You don't go looking for the cheapest heart transplant surgeon.  If you're hit by a bus and scooped up by an ambulance you can't solicit bids for the best treatment, and MUST pay whatever it costs wherever they drop you off.  

It's a fallacy that our for-profit system drives innovation.  Cutting edge medical treatments aren't covered by most insurance plans, and require you (or someone else) to pay out of pocket for them.  If it's not in the normal pre-negotiated catalog, you're on your own.  

That rewards mediocrity, not innovation.  That's why our country is losing our lead and our doctors are leaving.  They know the best course of treatment, but don't feel like negotiating with some $15/hr insurance rep working a phone bank to go straight to it without trying 10 other things that won't work first.  

Nobody benefits from that.  Not the world, not US citizens, not even the for-profit corporations propping this shit system up.  ",1

Marvel, de Disney, dedica la primera película en solitario a uno de sus superhéroes femeninos, con el estreno de ‘Capitana Marvel’. 

La oscarizada actriz Brie Larson debuta en el Universo Cinematográfico Marvel (UCM) como Carol Danvers, piloto de pruebas de la Fuerza Aérea estadounidense, quien inicia un viaje para descubrir su verdadera identidad y dominar los increíbles poderes que posee, pero de los que poco sabe.Esta es la primera cinta de Marvel ambientada en los años 90, en el momento en que Danvers, una noble pero renegada heroína guerrera, cae del cielo para convertirse en la Capitana Marvel y ampliar la ya abultada nómina de los Vengadores.Con la guerra como lenguaje universal de la famosa franquicia de superhéroes, las circunstancias del relato ubican a la protagonista en medio de una batalla galáctica entre dos razas alienígenas, donde tendrá que probar su valor y su destreza.Los tráileres ya anticipan un ‘block­buster’ en toda forma, con guiños nostálgicos, revelaciones y conexiones con otras películas del UCM, escenas poscréditos (dos), toda una variedad de trucos visuales y al igual -aunque después- que ‘Wonder Woman’, un discurso de empoderamiento femenino en el cine de superhéroes.Larson se luce frente a la cámara y el ‘chroma’ como un personaje que derriba prejuicios para ganar respeto en un medio mayoritariamente masculino. Del otro lado de la cámara aparece otra guerrera, Anna Boden quien, junto con Ryan Fleck, sigue abriendo espacio para la dirección femenina.

Of course there are drugs that are just shit - they are usually even not illegal or only used under special economic circumstances (crocodile in Russia) 

Some drugs are dangerous and life destroying (fenta, meth...) and are only used by people who are basically fine with that.

This kind of consumption, and the drug it self is born out of a sick world - they have not to do with the plant origins - they are basically economic killer traps to extract as much money from it's victim as possible until they die.

370,2019-03-07 20:52:41+00:00,"Two responses there:

1. Timothy tells us that pastors must be able to teach, and the word there is interchangable with the word for elders. I'll get into this more below.
2. Even if we don't hold them to be interchangable, elders are still commissioned with teaching in Titus 1:9, where elders are charged with refuting false teaching, and encouraging with accurate teaching. In other words, a core element of the office of elder is teaching. 

&amp;#x200B;

1 Timothy tells us that overseers must be able to teach. The Greek word there is \*episkopes.\* 

Titus tells us that Paul is commissioning his disciple to appoint elders. The Greek word there is \*presbytrous.\*

These words are used interchangably throughout scripture. We can see all three terms used in Acts 20, referring to the same group (the elders of the Ephesian church, who were appointed as overseers, and charged with pastoring).  The following explains some of these examples (from [biblehub.org](https://bible.org))

[https://biblehub.com/greek/4245.htm](https://biblehub.com/greek/4245.htm)

That they did not differ at all from the (ἐπίσκοποι) bishops or overseers (as is acknowledged also by Jerome on [Titus 1:5](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/titus/1-5.htm) (cf. Lightfoot's Commentary on Philippians, pp. 98f, 229f)) is evident from the fact that the two words are used indiscriminately, [Acts 20:17, 28](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/acts/20-17.htm); [Titus 1:5, 7](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/titus/1-5.htm), and that the duty of presbyters is described by the terms ἐπισκοπεῖν, [1 Peter 5:1](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_peter/5-1.htm)f, and ἐπισκοπή, Clement of Rome, 1 Cor. 44, 1 \[ET\]; accordingly only two ecclesiastical officers, οἱἐπίσκοποι and οἱ διάκονοι, are distinguished in [Philippians 1:1](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/philippians/1-1.htm); [1 Timothy 3:1, 8](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_timothy/3-1.htm). The title ἐπίσκοπος denotes the function, πρεσβύτερος the dignity; the former was borrowed from Greek institutions, the latter from the Jewish; cf. (Lightfoot, as above, pp. 95ff, 191ff); Ritschl, Die Entstehung der altkathol. Kirche, edition 2, p. 350ff; Hase, Protest. Polemik, edition 4, p. 98ff; (Hatch, Bampton Lects. for 1880, Lect. 3 and Harnack's Analecten appended to the German translation of the same (p. 229ff); also Harnack's note on Clement of Rome, 1 Cor. 1, 3 \[ET\] (cf. references at 44 at the beginning), and Hatch in Dict. of Christ. Antiq., under the word .

They didn't look at or acknowledge any tend in heroin deaths before the reformulation. They make a baseless claim that oxy abusers went to heroin and were just as likely to die. They show no figures for that. 
so the problem is that you could also conclude from the information that heroin deaths continued to happen in growing numbers in areas where there was already high heroin usage. So the reformulation of oxycotin did not reduce the number of heroin deaths. But it did reduce the number of deaths for oxycotin.

Artificial, claro, e feita de celulose para que ninguÃ©m escorregasse naquela enorme estaÃ§Ã£o de esqui montada pela [Chanel ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/chanel-produz-seus-bordados-em-atelie-escondido-em-zona-industrial-afastada-de-paris.shtml)em pleno Grand Palais.

 Ãltima mega apresentaÃ§Ã£o concebida pelo estilista Karl Lagerfeld, [morto no mÃªs passado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/lagerfeld-era-super-heroi-da-moda-que-tornou-imortal-tudo-o-que-tocou.shtml), era composta por dez chalÃ©s de madeira em tamanho real, que atÃ© fumaÃ§a soltavam das chaminÃ©s, emoldurados por painÃ©is gigantescos de montanhas nevadas.

 A cidadela cenogrÃ¡fica representava a grandiosidade com a qual, durante mais de trÃªs dÃ©cadas, o ""kaiser"" reverenciou o legado de [Coco Chanel](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/07/chanel-mostra-esperteza-ao-abrir-faturamento-pela-primeira-vez.shtml) e, a partir dele, fez seu prÃ³prio dicionÃ¡rio de elegÃ¢ncia.

 Marco histÃ³rico da trajetÃ³ria da grife, o desfile reuniu fashionistas, mais montados do que nunca em seus conjuntos de tweed e propostas P&amp;B, bem ao estilo Chanel/Lagerfeld, e celebridades da moda. [Silvia Fendi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/12/pele-animal-nao-esta-em-declinio-diz-estilista-da-fendi-na-design-miami.shtml), parceira do estilista na grife italiana que leva seu sobrenome, era uma das convidadas especiais. 

 A atriz PenÃ©lope Cruz, amiga de longa data, nÃ£o sÃ³ veio a Paris para o adeus como pediu para desfilar. Ela encerrou a apresentaÃ§Ã£o com uma flor branca na mÃ£o, trajada com o vestido ""snow ball"", branco, bordado e cujo foi um dos Ãºltimos feitos por ele.

 Apesar de ser considerada a Ãºltima coleÃ§Ã£o criada pelo estilista, Ã© da nova diretora criativa e antigo braÃ§o direito de Lagerfeld, [Virgine ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/pedrodiniz/2019/02/braco-direito-de-lagerfeld-assume-comando-da-chanel.shtml)[Viard](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/pedrodiniz/2019/02/braco-direito-de-lagerfeld-assume-comando-da-chanel.shtml), boa parte das peÃ§as desfiladas. Ela terminou o trabalho que, jÃ¡ debilitado, ele nÃ£o conseguiu concluir.

 Mesmo com uma aura de transiÃ§Ã£o, o inverno 2020 da Chanel Ã© puro [Lagerfeld](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/sou-um-ninfomaniaco-da-moda-que-nunca-alcanca-o-orgasmo-disse-lagerfeld.shtml). Os conjuntos de blazer e calÃ§a xadrez, combinados Ã s correntes de ouro e camisa com babados sÃ£o tÃ­picos do repertÃ³rio do estilista.

 O viÃ©s jovem, traduzido em doudones compostas com saias midi, cores acesas e conjuntos amplos esportivos, jÃ¡ passeou pela passarela de Lagerfeld e, mais uma vez, elimina o aspecto mofado que as roupas poderiam passar.

 A voz do estilista quebrou o minuto de silÃªncio pedido pela marca logo apÃ³s as modelos se posicionarem em frente Ã casa principal do cenÃ¡rio. Ele explicava, em francÃªs, que nÃ£o queria o trabalho na Chanel porque achava tudo velho demais e feito para pessoas velhas. 

 Mas aceitou o desafio e, continua, soube que havia cumprido seu dever quando a rainha Elizabeth 2Â° foi a um desfile e lhe disse que suas modelos pareciam andar dispostas em uma pintura.

 Nessa passarela pÃ³stuma, essa pintura mira paisagens urbanas dos anos 1990, com calÃ§as retas e xadrezes. O pied de poule caracterÃ­stico da grife adorna looks completos, e as capas, pesadas e arrematadas por minibolsas, completavam o combo imagÃ©tico pelo qual [Lagerfeld ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/em-entrevista-a-folha-estilista-karl-lagerfeld-se-comparou-a-homero.shtml)foi reconhecido.

 Assim como aconteceu no [final do desfile da Fendi](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/02/ao-som-de-bowie-fendi-desfila-em-milao-ultima-colecao-de-karl-lagerfeld.shtml), em MilÃ£o, a Chanel tocou ""Heroes"", de David Bowie, para homenagear seu super-herÃ³i, que ganhou uma caricatura distribuÃ­da como souvenir aos convidados.

 Nela, ele e Coco Chanel estÃ£o juntos em uma conversa animada e, no alto da pÃ¡gina, lÃª-se a frase ""a batida continua"".

*-La señora, probably*",1
414,2019-03-04 17:16:31+00:00,"Because fetanyl is the new crack. 

In any event, I did the drug math: 

5 kilos of fetanyl = 5,000 grams, assuming the shit licking rat bastards at DEA didn't do weight wizardry (which they most likely did) so it's more likely to be 4,500gr and the same applies to the heroin, around 5,500gr.

* Now, what the DEA does not tell the media is that the 5,000gr's of Fet and the 6,000grs of H **are already cut** with lactose **BEFORE** it reaches the states. Meaning that a kilo of H has about as much as 1/4 to 1/2 (depending on Relative Purity or RP) of the product cut with agents that are meant to **NOT KILL THE CUSTIES** (because who the fuck would want that? Talk about a PR nightmare.)

____________________

Anywhosers, so if the math does add out (which it would) they really were holding maybe about 2.5 ki's of fet (depending on how much was lost during shipping, this kind of shit does happen more often than one realizes) and then 3.5 ki's of H. 

* Break down the product into bundles, that's 10 bags to every gram, so that's 25,000 bags of fet and 35,000 bags of heroin at 1/10th gram (standard measurements.) 

* Fet cannot be measured at 10th's, it's measured in hundreths, as anything larger is considered to be a fatal overdose. 

* The fet would get scrambled with the H to boost the products RP, meaning that they were distro'ing both and, using levigation and allegation, you most likely had close to 50,000-75,000 bags of scramble dabbled up (depending if they recut, which they did, and not assuming they didn't keep personals, the dealers...)

* If the street value of those kilos is enough to kill ""2 million people,"" according to the DEA: **that too is also bullshit,** as they assume mid tier dealers (IE middlemen/women) would be cutting up their product. 

_____________________________

**A kilo of H is worth maybe $40,000-$60,000, depending on the price break you get for copping.** 

**The faster you move, the better you deal.** 

1. A 5 lb lot for H would probably come up to about ~$80,000 

2. With the fet amounting to about ~$100,000 

3. meaning they spent close to $180,000 with S&amp;H (plus the extra Ki of H, which was probably due to a fuck up with the mail because of the DEA,) 

4. so ~$200,000

5. which would (at $100/gr,) 

6. would net these dealers about $5,000,000.

But enough to kill 2,000,000 people? That is utter whore shit.",1
415,2019-03-04 03:13:04+00:00,"I feel ya man... last time I used H was a few years ago.. when that “dream” ends, it’s like waking up with just no life, no soul, finding no passion in absolutely nothing.. which is why most of the time opiate addicts are misunderstood in general, the drug takes control over every aspect of your life, your body, and not being able to find much interest in anything for a longgg time after. I too have a pretty fucked oxycodone habit (240mg a day) ... sometimes I blow through 90 in a week, sometimes I actually make the right choice and spare the ugly withdrawals, and make them last. But there’s no other fucking drug like some oxy or heroin. Although I’ve never had tar, but I’ve had some China white and some pretty good standard heroin, ya know the one that cooks up like coke a cola. When I wasn’t high, I’d just obsess about the next time I can use. You aren’t the only one man, who the hell can blame you? It’s the best fucking feeling in existence. Not here to give advice because if I had it my way I’d have an unlimited supply of heroin and oxycodone .. hydromorphone is the shit as well, dilaudid... oxymorphone... it’s like the best heroin and oxycodone combined.. by the way, you described what being addicted to opiates is like to the exact. That warm fucking blanket or bucket of water being slowly poured over your head, and as it’s pouring, all of your worries, anxiety, pain, just disappears like it was never there. Just happy and content, completely fucking dead on the inside, yet in the almost wonderful way,, not to mention the best fucking euphoria (more than any other drug) IMO.. I don’t fuck with anything but opiates, people don’t understand that they can’t be used recreationally, because by the time you first use, you look back up in a few minutes wishing you had more.. and the absolute horrible feeling waking up in the morning, with no dope, no pills, well, you had your fair share with oxy, so you know the withdrawals are almost the same, if not the same as heroin. Heroin is just way cheaper and a bit stronger. If I wasn’t absolutely terrified of the fetanyl that’s being put in every fucking batch of dope now, I’d for sure, without a doubt, have a heroin habit.. the thought of overdosing on fetanyl laced heroin is the only thing stopping me.. so yea man, once you know what opiates do to your body,you never want to be without them.. wish I could actually get my hands on some hydromorphone tbh.. or even better, oxymorphone. Like you described it, it’s like having a girlfriend, that doesn’t love you back but we are so blinded that we believe it does. It will make you feel like you are in the highest of heavens and then push you to hell in the blink of an eye.. good luck man. Wish I had advice to give you, or to even give to myself. If you ever decide to go back to heroin, do it safe. ",1

Dopamine doesn't necessarily control pain but it can help you learn to want to repeat a behavior in spite of the pain. Or even to enjoy the pain as a trigger to expecting a positive result--kinda like Pavlovs dogs.

I'm 22f and mine was just weird bruise on my thigh that now covers most of that thigh and my shin. I went to the doctor as soon as I started to not look like a bruise (it started to look dry, translucent, whitez shiny, scaly) which was November call in and an appointment in December where I had a biopsy done. My GP was rally confused on what it was and thought it was effecting my fat so it was a really deep biospy. At this point I had googled high and low and expected a scleroderma as the result. When I went back in to seem GP January 15. I was told Morphea at the time whcih sounds like the best you can hear.

I met my rheumatologist in late January and started my methotrexate last Monday at 0.6cc and am now at 0.7cc we changed it to Saturdays just incase I get symptoms from it. My dosage at the mean time will be 0.8cc moving forward. I'm supposed to watch my skin like a hawk to see if it's progressing faster if it is I have to get back in immediately.

I'm also super scared cause I mean if it is worst case scenario that's 2 more years which is terrifying. Especially since the meds won't even start maybe working till April.

I also have joint pain in my knee and ankle where the scleroderma defiantly is. I also have extreme itchiness im really concerned that the itchiness could be where it shows up next. But it isn't presenting the the same it's like a rash for me this time so ill be phoning my rheumatologist tomorrow cause if it is spreading faster we need to nip it in the butt. It doesn't feel or look like my leg at all it's more rash  like. However I woke up today after my shot last night and I don't have a much joint pain so let's hope that's a move in the right direction and not a fluke.

Methotrexate is a really common way to treat scleroderma at least in my area. I just got all my blood work done two Fridays ago and go in for my echocardiogram in two weeks the pulmonary function test hasn't been scheduled yet. I actually had my x-ray done once my GP found out it was may be Morphea and alot of blood work. So we can develop a baseline and have those test redone pretty frequently in the beginning.

I still haven't been told whcih type I have which is also concerning. If you wanna talk feel free to contact me although most people in here have had the disease longer and better understanding.

Currently I'm diagnosed with sclederma and an treated with methotrexate. This is in Canada, BC. Since treatment may vary by country. Also if anyone else wants to reach out to me or is willing to let me talk to them I'd love to discuss about the itchiness cause I can't find much on that online and would like to understand it better.",1

They thought they were snorting Coke, but it was laced with Fentanal.

451,2019-03-01 03:28:21+00:00,Yeah and then just watch the fentenyl overdoses skyrocket. That would legit just kill a lot of street drug users. Good idea in theory but hard clash with reality. ,1
452,2019-03-01 03:04:45+00:00,"The trades have been derided by media across the entire league.  Donato is was the only trade with a fair return.  The returns for Nino and Granlund were unanimously panned.  In fact, the only ones with anything positive to say about those deals was the local media and fans carrying water for Fentonyl.

Undoubtedly there needs to be change, but that doesn't mean you just take the first shit someone offers you.  Just because you really like a guy (who doesn't even play fucking right wing), doesn't mean you should trade an objectively more valuable asset (who does fucking play right wing) 1for1.  That's poor management anyway you look at it.

After this year's deadline deals, Fenton's peers are going to treat him like a rube and continue to call him with Chiarelli-tier trades knowing he'll bite hard with no resistance.",1
