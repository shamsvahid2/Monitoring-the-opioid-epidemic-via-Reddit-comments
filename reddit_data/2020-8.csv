1. If he swallowed a bag of fentanyl don't you think that would have shown up in at least one of the two fucking autopsies?

If all they have is ""video"" that I'm sure doesn't exist, how do they know it's fetanyl? It's white powder in a bag. They'd need to test it to ascertain the contents.

&gt;They argue he was screaming ""I can't breathe"" before he was removed from the police vehicle and held on the ground.

2. ""They argue"" their word against video evidence of a knee on a man's neck saying he can't breathe. This isn't evidence.

&gt;They dismiss his claustrophobia assertion as bs because Floyd didn't seem to be having claustrophobia in his own car that police removed him from.

3. driving your own car is very different than being thrown in the back of a police car. Also unrelated to leaning on the guys neck for 8 minutes while onlookers beg you to stop.

People OD in police custody all the time because the cops get called when people are on drugs and not acting in line with society expectations- right or wrong. 

To shrug off that drugs had ZERO to do with the death of a man with a lot of fentynyl in his system, who had lungs full of fluid, who was screaming ""i can't breathe"" well before he was knelt on- that is just kinda rediculous. 

This wasn't a healthy 31 year old sitting on the curb that cops put in a headlock and killed. Clearly, if he HAD been healthy and not in drugs, it's EXTREMELY unlikely the positional asphyxiation would have happened.",1

It''s up to a good prosecution to offer an alternate response where police use the minimum force necessary to detain and cuff Floyd while they sort out the accusation of using a fake $20, where if Floyd were to suffer a medical emergency on his own, it was clearly not exacerbated by an excessive use of force where one guy is kneeling on his neck while two others are sitting on his body adding hundreds of pounds of resistance to his efforts to breathe through an already restricted airway.",1

also on the same note: I have been having back pain for like a year now, could that be because of the benzos? I thought it was because of my office job as my coworkers have a similar back pain, I think I had the back pain before I started taking benzos here and there, and it doesn't stop once I stop taking them neither it gets worse when I do take them, any pill you could recommend for back pain?",1

Single issues can mobilize the other side too. 

Someone who is moderate whose kid was killed by fentenyl might see this as a demotivator to either stay home or switch vote for the douchebags.

Theres so many more issues that are more unifying that people seem to ignore.

Wtf ever happened to reasonable people sitting down together to talk about issues that impact us all that we all see every day?  Some are far more pervasive and destructive if you dig in a little.

Why is it you as a wage earner cant get ahead?  Cause republicans rite?  Well almost.

Its because offshoring and oursourcing.  

I travel quite a bit and i understand global labor market place.  You are fucked as an american wage earner cause people around the world are now just as educated, internet has made remote work possible, and the cost structure - between their wages and health insurance and taxes - is 90% less than yours.

One party is trying to shine a light on this while the other is doing everything they can to not let you see it:

And bipartisan my ass.  Like 2 republicans reached across the isle while the rest of the scumbags did everything thry could to discredit the idea as unworkable.

Anyway, Thats a unifying concept.  Who doesnt want ssi?  who doesnt want clean water and safe infrastructure? Who doesnt want higher wages and more disclosure to the nefarious shit corporations are doing?

See tax on your wages pay for schools, bridges, waste treatment, grammas ssi.

When these jobs are exported, none of that gets paid and the disparity between rich and poor get greater.

No one takes the time to explain this....instead they reach for political partisan bullshit which can poison the well.

From experience talking with people with different political ideas, we have more in common than we think. The problem is we have different language to talk about the same thing.

As I understand it, the companies who manufacture opiates purposefully manipulated research to show that they were less addictive than they actually are. On top of this distributors like CVS and walgreens who were supposed to alert the government of irregularly high opiate sells failed to do so because they were making insane amounts of money. Then you have doctors and clinics who got kick-backs that functioned as prescription mills. In every case these people put their personal profit above the well being of society. someting like 75% of opiate addicts and people who overdosed on opiates (1999-2017) started with opiates that were prescribed to them. Since 1999 about 450,000 people have died of an opiate overdose. People were hoooked on opiates due to prescriptions, then when the governemnt clamped down people turned to heroin and fantanyl.

Any attempt on my end to have any kind of positive interaction leads to her acting completely rude and crazy and we've had MULTIPLE blow out fights...

She too bought a FULL CRIB when I didn't even have one myself and she couldn't comprehend that we were not leaving the baby with a smoker who was WAY high on pain meds all the time (and I'm a chronic pain patient myself- she was flat out nodding out on fentynyl 24/7 on top of being mentally ill!)

 Like the time she made Christmas MISERABLE by insisting that I ""set her up to fail"" by giving her a list of Xmas gifts our son would like - and then allowing other people to buy things she didn't get.... And then she SCREWED UP, saying she bought him ""the game"" when she really bought him ""the rocket gun thing""- and then my son opened a second rocket gun and POLITELY SAID ""my uncle got me one of these this morning. I love it nana, but it's okay, the store at the mall has the ring toss game I want, so maybe we can take one back.""

She LOST IT and started YELLING at me in front of everyone that was at my husband's gmoms house for Xmas dinner! Then she not only accused me of ""wasting her time walking ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MALL""- She told my son he couldn't play his ""Pie Face"" game (that she had already SHOWED HIM the whiped cream can for!) - telling him ""You can go make a mess at your own damn home"" and made my 4 year old CRY ON CHRISTMAS.

 I was FURIOUS and told my husband we were leaving. After her whole fucking outburst- she tried to say ""my grandson isn't leaving without a hug""- I told him to go to the car and UNLOADED on her. ""You made my child CRY, you disrespected me after I tried to fucking HELP YOU by offering you affordable suggestions for gifts he would be truly EXCITED about- and then you GUILT AND SHAME a five year old because YOU TEXTED ME THE WRONG THING- (At this point I held the fucking text in her face- reading allowed how she ""bought him the game from the toy store at the mall""- one was a BOARD GAME, the other was a NERF GUN type thing. It was HER mistake and she not only ruined everyone's Christmas, but I was DAMN SURE not forcing my son to hug someone who made him CRY. 

Years went by and after a weekend in the Poconos where I TRIED SO HARD to be nice- I told my son we had ""a while before we were leaving and he could build a Lego set before we go""- I had already cleaned the bathroom and bedroom in the guest house id basically been FORCED TO GO STAY IN over MY WEDDING ANNIVERSARY which my MIL fully planned with zero interest in weather I would WANT to go there... And her response was to PASSIVELY AGGRESSIVE start slamming things in the kitchen, yelling about how DARE we be leaving without doing""anything to help out"" and ""who did I think I was to leave without cleaning the rooms we used""- because somehow ""there's time for you to build a Lego set""- in her insane mind translated to ""we're leaving as soon as your dad gets out of the bathroom"" - she's a literal psycho. Once again, she made my son completely upset and she's screaming to herself about how she ""TRIED SO HARD TO BE NICE ALL WEEKEND"" for me to ""ACT LIKE THIS"". I have never wanted to punch someone in the face more than her. 

My son is going to be 10 when his sibling is born. Our older son was the product of an assault before my husband and I were together, and so he's not biologically her grandson. Honestly, I'm worried about my son being related to that insane bitch by blood. 

But no girl- you are not crazy or alone in crying or being upset. My husband and I had a few wars because he spent his life coddling her and her insanity and I made it clear that was not going to happen at the COST of my happiness.

Wow, a website had an article you aren't even going to bother to link, I guess all of the research I've read and my personal experience should go in the trash!

&gt; Under your logic, Everclear isn't stronger than Bud Light and is just a better therapeutic dose of ethanol. Well, that's false.

There's no point in my comment where I suggested anything like this. Do a better job. I also don't appreciate lazy strawmen like ""But pretending the rules of every other psychoactive substance known to man doesn't apply"".

To my knowledge, alcohol is not a medically prescribed substance like marijuana. It's common knowledge that alcohol in many times more dangerous. And marijuana not just safer than Oxycotin and Soboxone, it's dramatically safer. 

Yes, there should be more research done. Patients should be educated on the risks and benefits. We already agreed on this. 

Limiting THC percentages when you don't seem to understand the products isn't based in science or reason, it just seems arbitrary. Statements like ""The percentages are beyond the minimum therapeutic dose for most patients."" show your lack of knowledge about the products. The percentage is not the dose. To your point, the dose isn't always established and is left up the patient. Evidently, many doctors find that risk of over-consumption to be less significant than the benefits.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

76,2020-08-29 06:03:39+00:00,"Alright dude, you got the mindset on point.

So the extruding disc pressing on the nerve root causes an inflammatory response in the nerve. This makes the nerve  swell up and it becomes painful (on top of the disc pressing on it, see how this is like a double edged sword?). Staying active is important, but during the acute phase of the herniation (by acute phase I mean the ""omg it's so painful I cannot even move"") the nerve has to rest so you don't aggrevate it further. When you can, walking is your exercise. Walking is a very gentle exercise which causes your back to compress and decompress, aiding in blood flow and thus nutrients going to and fro the disc. This is really the only exercise you should be doing without oversight from a physician. Some people find relief from certain exercises like a 'cobra pose', but this is very dependent on the herniation and doing this could worsen your symptoms. Really, only do stuff like this under guidance of a good PT. 
In short: walking when you can, but don't overdo it. It's better walking a few minutes a couple a times a day at first than going on big hikes. Extend your walks appropriately when you see the walks you have been doing don't cause pain the next day. (pain is often worse a day after, that's so tricky with herniated discs) 

In terms of medication, there's over the counter stuff you can try. Naproxen is an anti-inflammatory which could help a little bit with the pain and inflammation. But since nerve pain is such a nasty pain, over the counter medications don't really do much for the pain. You should see your doctor for this, but they often prescribe stuff like Tramadol or Oxycodon. These are morphine-related painkillers and they definitely help with the pain although it's quite heavy stuff. If you do without painkillers I suggest you do that, but if the pain interferes with your sleep then it's definitely worth getting some for the night. There's no medication that takes away the source of your pain, that's something only your body can heal in time or by surgical intervention. (again, contrary to what you might believe from this sub, very few people actually get surgery. Don't let the people on this sub scare you away from surgery either though. There's some serious fear mongering going on. If your situation is so dire and surgery would help you a lot then definitely do it). 

Other than that there isn't much you can do. Staying active without your boundaries and resting are the most important. Stuff like icing might relief some pain, although temporarily. I don't believe in ice helping with this condition, because the nerve root is located so deeply within the body the ice you put on your skin will never reach. It's more of a placebo thing if anything, but if it feels good then definitely do it. I've said this before, but do not stretch anything right now. People tend to stretch thinking it'll help, but the nerve is mad so why start pulling on it? Will only make it worse at this point. 

The only other thing I would really recommend is getting an epidural steroid injection. These can give you major long lasting, if not permanent, relief and the procedure (again, contrary to what you might read oh this sub) is easy-peasy. It fights the inflammation which reduces the swelling and painful reaction of the nerve bringing major relief. It doesn't always work for everybody, but for the majority it helps a lot and getting up to 3 of those shots is definitely worth it. These help the most in the early phase of your herniation, so if you do see your doctor I'd ask for these. 

I hope this is of any help to you, if there's more specifics you want to know feel free to ask. Just know that this injury will heal, it will just take a bit more time than your average sprained ankle and such.",1

91,2020-08-28 18:40:28+00:00,"&gt; In the US, the closest equivalent would be Opana. Oxymorphone (not oxycodone). 

Well heroin itself is a prodrug, that is then metabolized into 6-MAM and then morphine... so actually the closest equivalent is MORPHINE.

Heroin is VERY lipid soluble so it is able to pas the Blood Brain Barrier faster and then is converted to 6-MAM (active) and then to MORPHINE (active).

&gt;It's about as strong, if not stronger, than heroin

It is... Oxymorphone is the Active Metabolite of Oxycodone. It is about 3-5x more potent than morphine (heroins active metabolite).

&gt;People often abuse it do to the bioavailability. 10% strength orally, 40% nasal route.... Or 100% IV.

First of all IV is 100% for all drugs because its introduced directly into the veins, so thats a wierd comment. Secondly 10% is not a very good bioavailability, let alone for an opioid. oral Codiene is &gt;90%, Mophine is 25-50%, and hydrocodone is around 75%.

WHAT OXYMORPHONE DOES HAVE is high lipophilicity... remember heroin up top being lipid soluble? yea that the same for oxymorphone.

Anyways, all of this talk is bunk anyways, because all opioids are considered in ""morphine equivalence"" meaning they can all be converted to one another for similar effects and considering opioids do not have a ""ceiling effect"", theoretically all opioids are equal.

Obviously ignoring the virus the economy was doing fine (a lot of people shit on Trump because he didn't issue a national mask mandate, however that would be unconstitutional, as the constitution states any power not directly given to the federal government will be handled by the states).

You can argue Trump isn't doing enough to save the environment, but you can argue that about just about any country (not saying it's good, but I can't hate him for that).

No it isn't absurd that people have guns, especially right now. Due to the BLM riots, our cities are being terrorized and guess what happens when you charge a cop for self defense? They fucking leave. We have an insane number of 911 calls going unanswered because of this BLM bullshit and people need guns to protect themselves.

George Floyd didn't deserve to die, and the cops that handled the situation were rightfully fired and charged. That being said, Floyd's official cause of death was not asphyxiation, it was Fentonyl overdose. 

A large amount of the reason black people are killed by cops more is because they just commit more crime. This is obviously not due to the color of their skin. They tend to live in lower income areas and there seems to be a culture supporting it. 

You can argue we need better police training, police reform, whatever. But what I have a problem with is BLM people burning down private businesses and chanting all cops are bastards. Noone actually wants the cops gone unless you're a criminal.",1

Lethal dosage is not an accurate science and is based on a lot of different things, gender, race, weight, BMI, muscle mass, fat percentage, liver function, etc etc.  He had above the lethal dose by FDA standards but people have lived (without narcan) with significantly a concentration than the FDA lethal doae in their systems.  

In medicine you are told over and over to treat the patient not the monitor. That is to say humans operate in a range and someone can be healthy outside of what we normally consider the healthy range. An O2 sat of 80 on the average adult would be very concerning, but that can be the normal for someone with COPD.  I have treated many opioid Overdoses including several fatal ones. Having watched the George Floyd video it's my opinion he was not acting how you'd expect someone who was ODing to act.

Before there had been a point during which the police officer communicated his commands in a way which George Floyd could reasonably be expected to understand him.

&gt;Fair enough then why come out with an press conference and present it as fact?

I don't know if he presented it as a fact that the guy held up his hands and was shot from the direction he claimed. I'd assume he presented the fact that that was what his analysis indicated as a fact. If he did come out and say ""We know for a fact that this guy did these things"", then that would be a communication fault on his part. It would not be:

1. An incrimination of his ability to produce autopsies in line with the expected ability of a professional doctor.
2. And indication that he didn't accurately communicate the findings of the autopsy because it was in the interest of his clients not to do so.

&gt;Pretty out of context dude as the symptoms would not look like an death by Fenanyl while Floyds death sadly does 100 % look like a death by Fentanyl.

My point with that metaphor was to show that the phrase ""George Floyd was on lethal doses of fentanyl"" is a meaningful statement on its own. The autopsy shows results that are in line with dying from fentanyl, but also from things like asphyxiation. And doctors have concluded that certain harmful actions we see in the video would not have left permanent damage that would indicate that those harmful actions happened, so it seems as though the asphyxiation explanation is more probable.

&gt;This is only in the guys report the official autopsy rules differently...just like in Browns case and Floyds see a pattern?

It rules differently but your claim that the bone fractions are only in the independent report. The claim that fractures of that kind are very very infrequently caused by hanging full stop, let alone hanging using bed items, isn't something that only Baden claims, btw.",1
126,2020-08-27 20:57:03+00:00,"&gt; He taps on the window and tells him to show his hands. He's talking through a facemask and a car door so it's reasonable to assume George Floyd couldn't hear him. Then George Floyd opens the car door and apologises, saying he didn't do anything. The policeman orders him in a very commanding and threatening manner to show him his hands *once*, and then immediately pulls a gun on him. If you don't think that that causes a person to become significantly agitated, idk man, I don't know what to say. Even if you don't agree that the gun was pulled on him waaaay to early, it still contributed to agitating him, along with all the other effects I've mentioned. 

The gun was pulled after the cars door was open and Floyd still refused to show his hands...reasonable reaction by the officer nothing anyone would ever hold against him

&gt; This doesn't respond to my point that those false claims were the product of hard to verify details which needed to be corroborated with video footage, **which we now have**. 

Fair enough then why come out with an press conference and present it as fact?

&gt; If I take a lethal dose of fentanyl and jump of a cliff and die, was it the lethal dose of fentanyl that killed me?

In the justice system you have to prove stuff beyond a reasonable doubt how should that be possible if you can't say what exactly killed him and to which extend anyone was responsible

&gt;Ok so a couple of things. The fact that George Floyd was on doses of fentanyl that can be lethal is irrelevant to the actual cause of death. If you have a lethal cancer that's going to kill you in a couple of months, but you get shot by someone before that happens, the cancer doesn't at all affect the cause of death in a medical sense. Just because George Floyd was in lethal danger from one thing doesn't mean that's what killed him.

not quite the cause of his death was heart failure with his lungs also not providing enough oxygen....which is sadly a textbook case of what happens when you die of an Fentanyl overdose.

While dying from a knee on your neck would show rather violent permanent damage in the neck area as a lot of pressure has to be applied....this was not the cause in the independant autopsy as clearly shown no damge was found at all.

This means the cops either contributed to his death by not treating him right, or he simply died of the lethal dose...also explains why he said he could not breath while he was still held in their car prior to him pleading to be held on the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

its a shitshow how they held him was wrong and they should have provided aid but based on no injuries limiting his ability to breath combined with the cause of death lining up 100% with a lethal Fentanyl overdose I just dont see them convicting the cops simply as there is reasonable doubt that Floyd died from the Fentayl he took prior to them arresting him",1

BLM tem um historico meio ruim entao nao da pra confiar, mas nao da pra saber mesmo o que aconteceu.

Outro problema dessa historia toda eh que ele atravessou as fronteiras do estado dele pra ir comprar briga em outro estado, com uma arma que ele nao poderia estar carregando de uma fronteira pra outra, ainda mais sendo menor de idade.

Sinceramente? Na minha opiniao eh uma crianca meio perturbada mesmo meio ""minion"" que foi comprar briga pra ser heroi, acho que ele chegou la e ficou com o rifle numa boa, provavelmente agressao verbal de um lado pro outro... os BLM viram que o guri era jovem e ficaram mais agressivos, ele se assustou e atirou em um, ai a coisa fodeu e aconteceu o que da pra ver nos videos.

O problema todo eh, esse primeiro que ele atirou foi realmente legitima defesa ou ele soh se viu cecrcado de gente meio agressiva e atirou? Se for pra eu chutar eu acredito que foi legitima defesa.

Mas ai volta a questao, por que alguem sem treinamento vai ir comprar briga em outro estado e atuar como vigilante? Nao eh como se ele estivesse defendendo a casa ou o trabalho dele.

Eu acho que ele vai se foder mas nao por homicidio doloso, vai pegar algo mais leve, tipo culposo + atravessar fronteira armado + carregar arma ilegalmente e passar uns anos em cana simplesmente porque ele foi la comprar briga.

Will you change your mind when the officers are acquitted from those homicide charges? Or will a court verdict not be enough to invalidate those conclusion? My argument is that the autopsy report contradicts the ""conclusions"" you're talking about. The autopsy report states: no asphyxiation, no significant injuries to the neck or head, serious underlying health issues (potentially fatal), fatal levels of fetanyl but somehow it's the knee in the neck that killed him.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; but as you can see in the video, Floyd repeatedly begged for breath and  they kept him lying face down with a knee applying pressure to his  neck. The man stops moving, they can't find a pulse, and Chauvin keeps  his knee on his neck for **3 more minutes**. 

He was complaining about not being able to breath before the officers put a knee on his neck. His struggle for breath could have been caused by his COVID-19 infection or you know the part where his lungs were weighing 2-3X their normal weight during autopsy. I'll refer to something I pointed out before:

The autopsy revealed no physical evidence suggesting that Mr.Floyd died  of asphyxiation. Mr.Floyd did not exhibit signs of petechiae, damage to  his airways or thyroid, brain bleeding, bone injuries, or internal  bruising. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If it was a completely healthy, sober white man, would you agree with 3  officers sitting on him for 8 minutes while he begs for breath? would  you approve of them keeping pressure on 3 minutes after he's essentially  dead? Is it ok for them to refuse to help him when he's clearly in  distress? 

I don't see why his skin color is relevant in this discussion. I would be fine with it if it weren't for the part were they kept their knee on his neck after him being totally unresponsive. I don't think they should have backed of when they told him he had trouble breathing.

&gt;Sure underlying medical issues and drugs will have probably contributed  to his death, but the behaviour of the officers is abhorrent and  criminal no matter the circumstances. When you shoot a guy who's about  to jump off a cliff, you still murdered him... 

They didn't simply contribute to his death, they were the cause of death. The conduct of the officers was disgraceful but certainly not criminal. The only thing the officers did wrong was failing to help a person in need.  In most states, there is no general duty to  come to another person‚Äôs rescue. However, there are a few exceptions  where failure to rescue can lead to criminal prosecution or civil  liability in a personal injury suit.",1
157,2020-08-27 12:27:04+00:00,"&gt;Chief [Hennepin County Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker](https://www.fox9.com/news/court-filings-medical-examiner-thought-george-floyd-had-fatal-level-of-fentanyl-in-system)  said there was ""no physical evidence suggesting that Mr. Floyd died of  asphyxiation,"" according to documents obtained by the court as part of a  lawsuit from one of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest, Tou Thao.  
&gt;  
&gt;Baker determined that Floyd's death was the result of a  combination of factors. In a memorandum from June 1, Baker noted that  Floyd's fentanyl levels were ‚Äúpretty high"" and potentially fatal.   
&gt;  
&gt;""\[Baker\] said that if Mr. Floyd had been found dead in his  home (or anywhere else) and there were no other contributing factors he  would conclude that it was an overdose death,"" the memorandum stated.   
&gt;  
&gt;[Baker's final determination](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/medical-examiner-concludes-george-floyd-didnt-die-of-asphyxia)  listed Floyd's death as a homicide because of the actions of the  officers who restrained Floyd by kneeling on his neck. The Office of the  Armed Forces Medical Examiner similarly determined that Floyd's death  was a homicide ""caused by the police subdual and restraint in the  setting of severe hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,  and methamphetamine and fentanyl intoxication.""

So according to Dr. Andrew Baker: 

&gt;The autopsy revealed no physical evidence suggesting that Mr.Floyd died of asphyxiation. Mr.Floyd did not exhibit signs of petechiae, damage to his airways or thyroid, brain bleeding, bone injuries, or internal bruising

&gt;Dr. Stephen Nelson, chairman of Florida's medical examiners commission, who is not affiliated with the case, reviewed the new files and says that doesn't mean the drugs or health condition is what caused Floyd's death.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We've all had cases where those kinds of of levels come into play. You've got to look at the whole picture,"" Nelson said. ""It's one thing to die \*with\* something. It's another thing to die \*from\* something.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The documents say Baker performed the autopsy before watching the videos of police restraining Floyd, with Officer Derek Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck, because Baker wanted to avoid bias in his autopsy.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Baker's final report after watching the videos, he ruled Floyd's death a homicide caused by ""law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The FBI asked the Armed Forces Medical Examiner to review Baker's autopsy and they agreed with his findings, writing ""his death was caused by the police subdual and restraint"" with cardiovascular disease and drug intoxication contributing.""

if you are in the business of trusting the experts and agree with the *cause* of death, albeit with contributing factors, as they indicated then that means having Fetanyl in his system was a death sentence for George Floyd when it very well likely didn't have to be. and what he died from whas the method of restraint.

it would be one thing to say ""yeah, they only had him subdued with their knee on his neck for 2 mintues, reasonably applying police protocol with no reasonable suspicion they'd be putting his life at risk but unbeknownst to the police officers he had Fetanyl in his system and a health condition and it wasn't those 2 minutes that killed him or the way he was subdued but those may or may not have been contributing factors.""

(but we know the duration of restraint was longer than that. i bring up the above hypothetical statement because i suspect that something approaching it will be parroted online now that George Floyd was found to have Fetanyl in his system. i use 2 minutes as a benchmark because i can't possibly imagine how anyone would make this argument in good faith using the real number but i wouldn't put it past some people) 

instead it can be reasonably concluded though that if George Floyd received prompt medical intervention ‚Äî that which medical responders who arrived on the scene offered out of a professional capacity and concern ‚Äî he likely could be alive today. instead this intervention was denied as the officers subdued him in a way that is outside police protocol (due to the duration) for MUCH longer than 2 minutes, in a way that could be potentially lethal to healthy people with no drug history.

the United States has a Fetanyl problem, and George Floyd should not have been using it. but that's not a justification for how the police handled his case, in light of what we know about it so far and what the result of it was. (not that i'm accusing you of justifying anything, but i thought your post was a good place to stick this blurb of mine)",1

My sister has SLE and they say most ppl with Scleroderma have family members with autoimmune diseases. I was diagnosed 2 months after a Hypothyroid diagnosis,  which is also an autoimmune disease. Then 1 year later was diagnosed with Linchen Sclerosis,  yet another autoimmune disease.

I have cleaned up my diet, meaning no sugar or processed food. No alcohol. Limit carbs &amp; add lots of omega 3 and plant protein.  Still, the disease is progressing. I now have Raynauds (which it sounds like you may also) and GERD. Raynauds is often the first sign.

If you have any questions,  you can DM me. Check out Inspire message board for more info or to post, as well as the Scleroderma Foundation website.

185,2020-08-26 19:08:24+00:00,"&gt;Some people may be scared when the police immediately and aggressively approach them. George Floyd is an example of the immediate police escalation, where the policeman approached his car and drew a weapon (a firearm) before Floyd posed any reasonable threat. 

Reaching around for something isn't 'no reasonable threat' when the cops don't know what you have, plus your skewing the situation already to make it look like the cops did wrong here.  


&gt; Additionally, with insistence he did comply‚Äî but under the threat of a  firearm and the influence of drugs it clearly put him in a bad mental  state, unable to comply perfectly. 

Trying to diminish that he was high because ""threat of a firearm"" that was put away is very dishonest.  


&gt; He didn‚Äôt approach them aggressively, **he didn‚Äôt have a weapon**, and he didn‚Äôt yell obscenities or **act difficult** 

The police do not know he doesn't have a weapon when he's reaching around. You want thousands of examples of 'calm or polite freaking out' people who then reached for a gun to shoot at a cop? There's a lot of examples of that, and it doesn't diminish that you're full of shit here. And he WAS acting VERY difficult. He would take forever to comply, and rather than complying kept trying to make awkward demands  


&gt; Floyd kept expressing something was wrong, clearly with his behavior and  his words. He expressed he was having difficulties and the police made  it worse by making it *harder* for him to breath. 

You've already had the source, outside of one race baiting famous autopsy reporter who's been discredited before who's had a history of falsifying autopsies, the autopsy report of him having fentenyl in his system is the one that's true, even the gf attested to the fact he was high so when the fake autopsy dude came in saying ""no drugs"" he should have been found guilty of falsifying a report right then and there. His death was attributed to the stress and drug use that the pressure that left no marks could have exacerbated it, but alone could not kill him. The problem is there is no reason for a cop to put the knee to the back of their neck, but we're not talking about that as that's not the sole cause if at all of his death, even though it very well could have been if more force was pressed and shows bad training.  


&gt; ‚ÄúI have anxiety‚Äù ‚ÄúI have claustrophobia‚Äù and all of these signs that he wasn‚Äôt doing well. 

these are not reasons to let people do what they want. ""I have claustrophobia, let me commit murder without repercussions"" wouldn't fly, would it? he still had to be detained, so not sure why you thought ""I have claustrophobia even though I was fine in my car"" is a valid reason for anything.  


&gt; He was crying and still talking in a frenzy, but he wasn‚Äôt actively resisting.  

He kept trying to do the toddler drop to make it harder on them, but they held onto him to keep him from dropping to the ground and doing it, but it's common enough you can tell when someone's trying to draw all their weight to fall down. Which is a form of resisting, but he just failed at it.  


&gt;  I think everyone is trying to justify Floyd‚Äôs death  

No, everyone's been on board with reprimanding the officer for the knee on the back of the neck, but what the rational people with the video and autopsy out are saying is that he was having a DRUG OVERDOSE and what would have been more appropriate is training for them to tell the signs and to call an ambulance but even then it's hard to tell someone just being scared from someone who's having a bad OD right at that moment.  


Because BLM is using this to say cops are racist, so let's go break into businesses and black homes because we care about black lives. Even if cops were killing black people because they're racist, that in no way excuses hurting other minorities.

223,2020-08-25 16:02:34+00:00," O governo russo descarta por ora uma investiga√ß√£o criminal sobre as circunst√¢ncias que levaram o [opositor Alexei Navalni a ser internado, ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/aliados-tentam-tirar-opositor-de-putin-em-coma-apos-suposto-envenenamento-da-russia.shtml)naquilo que m√©dicos alem√£es afirmam ser um caso de envenenamento.

 ""√â preciso uma raz√£o para uma investiga√ß√£o Voc√™ precisa primeiro encontrar uma toxina e estabelecer o que causou essa condi√ß√£o. At√© aqui, temos um paciente em coma"", afirmou nesta ter√ßa (25) o porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitri Peskov.

 Na segunda (24), a pr√≥pria chanceler alem√£, Angela Merkel, havia dito que esperava uma investiga√ß√£o transparente das autoridades russas sobre o epis√≥dio.

 Navalni, advogado e blogueiro que ganhou fama ao mobilizar dezenas de milhares de russos para protestar contra a corrup√ß√£o em 2017 e depois buscou firmar-se como opositor do governo de Vladimir Putin, est√° internado em Berlim.

 [Ele passou mal em um voo de Tomsk a Moscou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/aliados-tentam-tirar-opositor-de-putin-em-coma-apos-suposto-envenenamento-da-russia.shtml), na quinta (20), ap√≥s ter tomado um ch√° no aeroporto. O avi√£o fez um pouso de emerg√™ncia em Omsk, onde os m√©dicos descartaram envenenamento.

  Isso levou seus aliados e a mulher, Iulia, a buscar a remo√ß√£o do ativista para tratamento na Alemanha no s√°bado (22). No hospital Charit√©, na capital alem√£, [ficou estabelecido que Navalni estava intoxicado com inibidores de colinesterase.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/alemanha-reforca-seguranca-de-opositor-de-putin-e-considera-envenenamento-muito-provavel.shtml)

 Trata-se de uma enzima que regula o sistema nervoso, ao controlar o n√≠vel do neurotransmissor acetilcolina.

 Medicamentos contra dem√™ncia usam os inibidores da colinesterase para evitar a quebra excessiva da acetilcolina e, assim, manter a transmiss√£o de est√≠mulos el√©tricos entre neur√¥nios em ordem.

 Por outro lado, em doses altas, os inibidores fazem o neurotransmissor subir a n√≠veis excessivos, rompendo a estabilidade do sistema nervoso e podendo levar √† morte ou a sequelas. Eles s√£o encontrados em pesticidas e armas qu√≠micas ‚Äîcomo o agente neurot√≥xico Novitchok (novato, em russo).

 O veneno ganhou fama em 2018, [quando foi usado contra o ex-espi√£o russo Serguei Skripal e sua filha, ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/03/kremlin-diz-ser-vitima-de-histeria-russofobica-e-vai-expulsar-britanicos.shtml)Iulia, que estavam no ex√≠lio no Reino Unido e sobreviveram. Londres acusou o Kremlin pelo envenenamento, gerando uma grande crise diplom√°tica.

 Pesa contra o Kremlin um longo hist√≥rico de cr√≠ticos do governo sendo envenenados. [Ao menos seis casos de grande repercuss√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/09/envenenamentos-de-opositores-de-putin-sao-marcados-por-misterio.shtml) ocorreram nos 20 anos de poder de Putin, al√©m de outros menos not√≥rios no exterior.

 Houve tamb√©m mortes mais objetivas, como os assassinatos a tiros da jornalista Anna Politkovskaia em 2006 e do [pol√≠tico opositor Boris Nemtsov, ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/03/homenagem-a-politico-assassinado-vira-polemica-eleitoral-em-moscou.shtml)em 2015. Em todos os casos, o Kremlin nega envolvimento.

 Um jornalista questionou Peskov sobre isso nesta ter√ßa. ""N√≥s n√£o podemos levar essas acusa√ß√µes seriamente. S√£o barulho vazio"", disse.

 O pr√≥prio Navalni havia sofrido um suposto envenenamento enquanto [cumpria uma de suas temporadas de 30 dias de pris√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/igorgielow/2018/06/um-espectro-chamado-navalni-o-heroi-da-vez.shtml) por organizar protestos n√£o autorizados, no ano passado.

 A fam√≠lia de Navalni acusa diretamente o presidente Putin pelo incidente. Aqui a argumenta√ß√£o de lado a lado √© mais nuan√ßada do que √† primeira vista.

 Envenenamentos s√£o tentativas de assassinato complexas, que precisam de planejamento e, usualmente, o emprego de mais de uma pessoa. N√£o h√° tantos qu√≠micos sofisticados com atribui√ß√µes de assassinos, pelo que se diz nos meios militares.

 A antiga KGB e outros servi√ßos secretos sovi√©ticos, onde serviram Putin e Skripal, eram conhecidos por assassinatos desse tipo. Ent√£o, a suspeita da execu√ß√£o sempre recai sobre ex-agentes com pr√°tica no assunto.

 A quest√£o, caso Navalni tenha mesmo sido envenenado como parece, √© a motiva√ß√£o.

 Em favor de Putin, h√° um ponto. N√£o faria sentido o presidente se expor a esse tipo de cr√≠tica t√£o √≥bvia, em especial porque o [barulho que Navalni faz nunca se traduziu em viabilidade eleitoral](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2017/07/1899664-misterio-cerca-toda-a-operacao-de-lider-anti-putin-nas-eleicoes-da-russia.shtml) ‚Äîo ativista n√£o √© unanimidade nem entre opositores do Kremlin que operam no sistema partid√°rio.

 A argumenta√ß√£o contraintuitiva sugere que isso daria um √°libi perfeito ao Kremlin. Mas Navalni tamb√©m incomoda advers√°rios em estratos bem mais baixos na pol√≠tica, com bem menos a perder do que autoridades no topo da cadeia de comando.

 Esses chefes locais, por sua vez, t√™m acesso a antigos membros de servi√ßos de seguran√ßa. Segundo a imprensa independente russa, Navalni estava em Tomsk n√£o s√≥ ajudando candidatos oposicionistas a se preparar para o pleito regional de setembro, mas tamb√©m investigando autoridades do partido governista R√∫ssia Unida.

 Sua especialidade √© a confec√ß√£o de dossi√™s, que publica online com alega√ß√µes de corrup√ß√£o. Foi isso que o fez virar figura nacional, a partir de uma[ apura√ß√£o sobre os bens do ent√£o premi√™ Dmitri Medvedev.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2017/07/1899239-opositor-russo-e-solto-apos-25-dias-na-cadeia.shtml)

 H√° uma terceira linha de racioc√≠nio, que especula algum interesse interno em constranger Putin com o ataque a um rival famoso no Ocidente. Dada a quantidade de vezes que Navalni foi preso e cerceado, ela parece bastante fr√°gil.

 Seja qual for a realidade, o Kremlin j√° est√° condenado aos olhos ocidentais no epis√≥dio, e j√° se v√£o alguns anos desde que se importou com isso. O mist√©rio tende a se perpetuar.",1

What kind of decisions? They have to work in certain boundaries.

If they administer any kind of medicine they usually have to first get feedback from the treating physician, at least here. What kind of tests are to be done is decided by the doc.  
Maybe nurses have more decisional power, but here ythey usually don't have. My brother is a palliative care nurse and when people are dying the is inofficially authorized by the doc to use certain medication without consultation to ease pain and suffering, but if he would not be and administer as much as a ibuprofen not to mention 100mg shots of mophine he would be in big trouble if it came out.

&gt;‚Äú(18.5.2) Now, some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod‚Äôs army came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against **John, that was called the Baptist**; (18.5.2) for **Herod slew him**, who was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for that the washing \[with water\] would be acceptable to him, if they made use of it, not in order to the putting away \[or the remission\] of some sins \[only\], but for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness. (18.5.2) Now, when \[many\] others came in crowds about him, for they were greatly moved \[or pleased\] by hearing his words, **Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people** might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion (for they seemed ready to do anything he should advise), **thought it best, by putting him to death**, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it should be too late. (18.5.2) Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod‚Äôs suspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I before mentioned, and **was there put to death.** Now the Jews had an opinion that the destruction of this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and a mark of God‚Äôs displeasure against him.‚Äù (Antiq 18.116‚Äì119 JOSEPH)",1

 A ‚Äúrecess√£o democr√°tica‚Äù ainda n√£o recebera nada no n√≠vel adotado por Fachin, exceto em parte pelo ministro Celso de Mello.

 Objetivo como os magistrados evitam ser, claro e simples como os magistrados detestam ser, franco e l√∫cido como deveriam ser as considera√ß√µes necess√°rias dos magistrados, Fachin advertiu que ‚Äúas elei√ß√µes de 2022 [as presidenciais] podem ser comprometidas se n√£o se proteger o consenso em torno das institui√ß√µes democr√°ticas‚Äù.

Definitely not an easy job, but you make a choice to be a cop, and you get to take off your uniform at the end of the night. Black people do not have that same privilege.

&gt;Do you really want to get rid of cops and have criminals running around taking over?

Nope, we didn't talk about abolishing the police, did we? I didn't say any such thing.

&gt;What are you gonna do when someone robs and kidnaps people you care? Call the cops?

Yes, that is the police's job. Not to arrest a citizen for *not* using a counterfeit bill just because he happened to be be a drug user, which like I said, is abundant in the US and even legalized in some states.

&gt;If your on drugs and you see cops pulling you over of course your gonna panic especially on fentayl and meth which he was high on (I forgot to say he was on fentanyl and meth).

Now you're changing your tune. So he had a right to panic? Being in a country where black people are killed 2.8 times more than white people, he had a right to panic. He had a right to freak out. He feared exactly what he knew was coming. And the cops should be trained to handle someone who might be high, someone who might have a panic attack (the amount of times police have killed people when responding to wellness checks because they're not trained to deal with mental illness is staggering). 

Emphasizing whatever drugs he was on does not justify him being killed. There are charges for possession and usage of controlled substances. DEATH, is not one of those charges.",1

 O caso poderia ser um prato cheio para o sensacionalismo. De fato, a extrema direita, religiosos conservadores e pol√≠ticos √°vidos de holofotes tentaram fazer dele uma [esp√©cie de circo de horrores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/08/menina-de-dez-anos-entrou-em-hospital-na-mala-do-carro-enquanto-medico-distraia-religiosos.shtml).

 N√£o se sabe como, a informa√ß√£o vazou. Pessoas contr√°rias ao aborto foram √† porta da maternidade p√∫blica onde ocorreu o [procedimento, no Recife](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/08/menina-que-engravidou-apos-estupro-teve-que-sair-do-es-para-fazer-aborto-legal.shtml), e tentaram impedi-lo, al√©m de hostilizar os profissionais de sa√∫de da unidade. Curioso que a extrema direita eleja a pedofilia como o mal maior, mas, na hora em que ela se configura, fa√ßa de tudo para olhar para o outro lado.

 Entre os grandes ve√≠culos de comunica√ß√£o, o que chamou a aten√ß√£o foi a cobertura s√≥bria e cuidadosa do caso.

 Na **Folha**, as reportagens buscaram contextualiza√ß√£o, explicando de maneira clara que a lei brasileira [autoriza o aborto ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/08/crianca-que-engravidou-apos-ser-estuprada-no-es-passa-bem-depois-de-aborto-legal.shtml)em casos de gravidez resultante de estupro, risco de morte para a gestante ou caso de anencefalia do feto e que, ainda assim, [interpreta√ß√µes m√©dicas ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/08/uso-irrestrito-de-objecao-de-consciencia-restringe-o-direito-ao-aborto-no-pais.shtml)ou judiciais podem fazer com que meninas, adolescentes e mulheres tenham seus direitos postergados ou at√© mesmo n√£o atendidos.

 Uma leitora observou que, em meio a frases destacadas para a repercuss√£o do caso, a **Folha** incluiu os [improp√©rios ditos por Sara Giromini](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/08/veja-o-que-damares-e-outros-disseram-sobre-caso-de-menina-de-dez-anos-gravida-apos-estupro.shtml)‚Äîextremista que, segundo a leitora, n√£o teria idoneidade para ter uma de suas frases inclu√≠das no destaque.

  Outro ponto que chamou a aten√ß√£o foi a reprodu√ß√£o, feita pela** Folha**, de afirma√ß√£o do suspeito, que disse manter relacionamento com a crian√ßa desde 2019‚Äîa palavra ""relacionamento"" foi colocada entre aspas.

 Como n√£o h√° relacionamento sexual poss√≠vel com uma crian√ßa (a menina de dez anos disse que era estuprada desde os seis), as aspas usadas para enfatizar a declara√ß√£o podem confundir e at√© mesmo produzir outros efeitos, como o de ironia. Seria melhor que a afirma√ß√£o tivesse sido acompanhada de contextualiza√ß√£o: n√£o importa o termo que o suspeito queira dar, o que ocorreu √© crime.

 O procedimento m√©dico come√ßou no domingo (16). Na noite do mesmo dia, a **Folha** publicou o nome do hospital onde a menina estava internada.

 Mais cuidadoso, o Globo n√£o divulgou o nome do hospital nem mesmo na segunda (17). Em outro bom exemplo, o Jornal Nacional separou alguns segundos para dizer que n√£o diria o nome do suspeito pelo longo hist√≥rico de abusos, nem o identificaria de nenhum outro modo para n√£o expor a garota e proteg√™-la de ataques.

 No Brasil, segundo dados oficiais, em m√©dia, seis meninas entre 10 e 14 anos estupradas s√£o internadas por dia em decorr√™ncia de abortos, promovidos ou n√£o no hospital. J√° o aborto ilegal √© uma das maiores causas de √≥bito entre mulheres gr√°vidas, algo que atinge principalmente as pobres e negras.

 Ainda assim, a interrup√ß√£o da gravidez √© geralmente discutida sob uma perspectiva religiosa ou moral, n√£o como uma quest√£o de sa√∫de p√∫blica.

 Se a [sociedade ainda n√£o parece preparada](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/de-25-paises-brasil-e-2o-com-menor-apoio-ao-aborto-diz-pesquisa.shtml) para fazer um [debate sereno em torno da quest√£](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/08/mesmo-entre-grupos-religiosos-nao-ha-consenso-em-torno-do-aborto.shtml)o, que a [m√≠dia siga fomentando-o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/opiniao/2020/08/direito-ao-aborto.shtml) com a seriedade que merece.

 √â pena que a pr√≥pria **Folha** tenha abandonado essa mesma seriedade ao abordar outro tema que ganhou destaque ao longo da semana: as discuss√µes acerca do mecanismo de limite de gastos p√∫blicos.

 Uma reportagem rasa sobre o assunto foi publicada na ter√ßa (18). Nela, banqueiros e gestores s√£o ouvidos sob anonimato para chegar √† conclus√£o de que [Bolsonaro se compara a Dilma, pois o governo gasta mais do que pode](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/08/bancos-temem-que-bolsonaro-vire-uma-dilma-e-gaste-mais-do-que-pode.shtml).

 Ap√≥s a reportagem, editorial publicado na s√°bado (22) dobrou a aposta, fazendo a defesa da austeridade fiscal sob o sugestivo t√≠tulo ""[Jair Rousseff](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/opiniao/2020/08/jair-rousseff.shtml)"".

 Dilma Rousseff acreditava que a pol√≠tica de gastos desenfreados‚Äîque inclu√≠a os tais ""programas redentores de obras p√∫blicas e de assist√™ncia social"", como diz o editorial‚Äîtraria crescimento econ√¥mico.

 Em quase dois anos de governo, √© poss√≠vel dizer que Jair Bolsonaro n√£o √© um [liberal nem um desenvolvimentista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/08/governo-vai-anunciar-plano-para-destravar-economia-e-agenda-social.shtml), mas algu√©m que far√° o que for [necess√°rio para se reeleger](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/08/bolsonaro-faz-almoco-com-centrao-incluindo-parte-dos-acusados-no-quadrilhao-do-pp.shtml).

 J√° a **Folha **parece lan√ßar m√£o de um artif√≠cio infantil para fazer o presidente mudar de ideia, usando algo que ele consideraria ofensivo: a compara√ß√£o com a ex-presidente.

Long term drug use make your teeth rot and your face gets all knicked up with holes. It costs a shit ton of money to pay for a DUI, or worse, - I know, I got one once and it cost around $12,000 in the end.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

5) the argument for drugs is racist, white people have been doing it all the time to make up for their incompetence of the situation and their lack of action to get rid of our drug problems

 Ele est√° em coma, segundo disse no Twitter sua assessora de imprensa, Kira Iarmich. Aliados de Navalni, temendo por sua vida, querem permiss√£o para remov√™-lo para ser tratado no exterior.

 Navalni, [um advogado de 44 anos,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/igorgielow/2018/06/um-espectro-chamado-navalni-o-heroi-da-vez.shtml) estava na cidade de Tomsk (Sib√©ria), 2.200 km a leste de Moscou, em reuni√µes com candidatos oposicionistas da elei√ß√£o regional russa, que ocorrer√° no m√™s que vem.

 √Äs 7h17 desta manh√£ (21h17 de quarta em Bras√≠lia), ele foi fotografado no aeroporto de Tomsk tomando ch√° em um copo de papel√£o. O autor da foto, Pavel Lebedev, embarcaria no mesmo voo da companhia S7 para Moscou.

 ""Ele foi ao banheiro depois da decolagem e n√£o voltou mais. Estava gritando de dor"", publicou Lebedev em redes sociais. Ele postou a foto de Navalni tomando o ch√° e um v√≠deo do atendimento dele no avi√£o no Instagram.

  A aeronave fez um pouso de emerg√™ncia em Omsk, 750 km distantes de Tomsk. L√°, Navalni foi levado inconsciente para um hospital e colocado no ventilador mec√¢nico.

 ""Ele est√° em coma. N√≥s assumimos que Alexei foi envenenado por algo misturado a seu ch√°. Foi a √∫nica coisa que ele tomou pela manh√£"", escreveu Iarmich no Twitter. Mais tarde, numa live, ela disse que ""n√£o h√° d√∫vida de que foi veneno"".

 O Kremlin desejou pronta recupera√ß√£o a Navalni. ""Qualquer envenenamento ter√° de ser confirmado por testes de laborat√≥rio"", afirmou o porta-voz de Putin, Dmitri Peskov, na sua entrevista coletiva di√°ria.

 [A aten√ß√£o que Navalni atrai ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/08/opositor-de-putin-alexei-navalni-e-preso-novamente-em-moscou.shtml)e as circunst√¢ncias de sua interna√ß√£o levam inevitavelmente √† mem√≥ria do destino de outros opositores e desafetos do governo russo.

 Ele mesmo foi v√≠tima anteriormente. Em 2018, durante um protesto, ele foi atingido com uma subst√¢ncia t√≥xica verde que o deixou parcialmente cego de um olho por um tempo.

  

No ano passado, [enquanto cumpria um dos in√∫meros termos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/05/lider-da-oposicao-russa-e-libertado-mas-enfrenta-duas-acusacoes.shtml]) de 30 dias de pris√£o por protestos n√£o autorizados, foi internado com uma rea√ß√£o al√©rgica aguda.

 Iarmich lembrou imediatamente do epis√≥dio de 2019 e o correlacionou com o desta quinta.

 O Kremlin sempre negou qualquer associa√ß√£o a ataques contra opositores. A lista, contudo, acumula casos ‚Äîcom [um m√≥rbido destaque √† modalidade envenenamento](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/09/envenenamentos-de-opositores-de-putin-sao-marcados-por-misterio.shtml).

 O mais famoso deles foi o epis√≥dio em que [Alexander Litvinenko, um ex-espi√£o,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/09/envenenamentos-de-opositores-de-putin-sao-marcados-por-misterio.shtml) foi envenenado com a subst√¢ncia radioativa pol√¥nio-210 em seu ch√° no Reino Unido. As imagens dele agonizante, sem cabelos, no hospital, correram o mundo.

 J√° em 2018, [o evenenamento de outro ex-espi√£o, Serguei Skripal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/03/acusacao-e-ridicula-no-caso-do-ex-espiao-mas-estou-aberto-para-conversar-diz-putin.shtml), e sua filha, gerou uma crise diplom√°tica. Eles foram atingidos por um composto da Guerra Fria, o Novitchok, tamb√©m no Reino Unido.

 Londres acusou diretamente Putin de operar em seu territ√≥rio e iniciou uma expuls√£o m√∫tua de diplomatas com Moscou na sequ√™ncia. Tamb√©m n√£o mandou representantes para assistir a abertura da Copa do Mundo daquele ano na terra de Putin.

 Ambos os epis√≥dios envolviam ex-espi√µes, cujas rixas com antigos colegas s√£o inescrut√°veis. J√° a [jornalista investigativa Anna Politkovskaia (2006)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2017/06/1897075-russia-condena-cinco-acusados-de-matar-rival-de-putin-em-2015.shtml) e[ o politico opositor Boris Nemtsov (2015)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/03/homenagem-a-politico-assassinado-vira-polemica-eleitoral-em-moscou.shtml), dois duros cr√≠ticos do regime de Putin, foram mortos a tiros nas mesmas circust√¢ncias d√∫bias: supostos bandidos tchetchenos.

 Segundo informou por WhatsApp o n√∫cleo de ativistas moscovitas da Funda√ß√£o Anticorrup√ß√£o, grupo de Navalni, h√° temor sobre a verdadeira condi√ß√£o do blogueiro. ""Estamos no escuro, a mulher de Alexei, Iulia, est√° voando para Omsk"", disse a mensagem.

 Antes disso, houve dois comunicados conflitantes do hospital na imprensa russa. Num, os m√©dicos disseram que Navalni estava em coma, mas est√°vel. Noutro, que corria risco de morrer.

 A representante regional do Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de russo, Tatiana Shakirova, disse a jornais russo que ""o envenenamento √© uma das hip√≥teses, mas n√£o √© poss√≠vel dizer o que foi agora"".

 J√° a ag√™ncia estatal Tass, por sua vez, informou que a pol√≠cia n√£o considerava o caso como um envenenamento, o que gerou alarme entre os colegas de Navalni.

 Segundo o site independente Meduza, a m√©dica de Navalni, Anastasia Vasilieva, chegou a Omsk e afirmou que os exames de sangue do blogueiro estavam regulares, mas que n√£o havia recebido ant√≠dotos contra toxinas. Ela informou que, por isso, pediu permiss√£o para tentar lev√°-lo para o exterior.

 A chanceler alem√£, Angela Merkel, afirmou nesta quinta que Navalni poderia receber ""toda a ajuda m√©dica"" necess√°ria na Fran√ßa ou na Alemanha, declara√ß√£o corroborada pelo presidente franc√™s, Emmanuel Macron, que se disse preocupado e triste pela hospitaliza√ß√£o do opositor russo.

 Macron exigiu transpar√™ncia, enquanto Merkel apontou que os l√≠deres europeus pedir√£o explica√ß√µes sobre o epis√≥dio, porque ""o que estamos ouvindo n√£o √© muito claro"".

 Segundo a funda√ß√£o, Navalni tamb√©m trabalhava numa investiga√ß√£o com um site de Tomsk acerca de corrup√ß√£o de autoridades locais do partido dirigente, o R√∫ssia Unida, que d√° suporte a Putin e √© dominante no pa√≠s.

 Foram essas atividades que tornaram Navalni c√©lebre, em especial no Ocidente. Ele surgiu como uma lideran√ßa nos primeiros grandes protestos enfrentados por Putin, em 2012.

 Cinco anos depois, contudo, seu trabalho como blogueiro anticorrup√ß√£o ganhou destaque nacional. Uma apura√ß√£o sobre os bens do ent√£o premi√™, Dmitri Medvedev, [levaram a uma onda in√©dita de protestos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2017/06/1892223-opositor-russo-e-detido-em-moscou-antes-de-protesto-contra-corrupcao.shtml) nacionais ‚Äîtodos convocados pela internet e descentralizados.

 A opera√ß√£o toda,[ como a** Folha** mostrou em 2017](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2017/07/1899664-misterio-cerca-toda-a-operacao-de-lider-anti-putin-nas-eleicoes-da-russia.shtml), √© bastante opaca. Isso levou a suspeitas de que Navalni poderia ser um pe√£o num dos jogos de poder da R√∫ssia putinista, mas o fato √© que ele crescentemente se colocou em oposi√ß√£o ao pr√≥prio presidente.

 [Tentou concorrer ao Kremlin em 2018,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/05/lider-da-oposicao-russa-e-libertado-mas-enfrenta-duas-acusacoes.shtml) mas foi impedido por causa de uma condena√ß√£o judicial nebulosa. N√£o que tivesse muita chance: apesar de ser o mais vocal opositor de Putin, sua penetra√ß√£o na R√∫ssia nunca lhe deu mais do que quase tra√ßo em inten√ß√£o de votos, segundo institutos independentes.

 Al√©m disso, [ele nunca teve apoio direto de opositores institucionais de Putin](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/03/homenagem-a-politico-assassinado-vira-polemica-eleitoral-em-moscou.shtml), integrantes de partidos estabelecidos.

We also have the largest former slave population in the world, a huge mixture of different cultures, and lots and lots of gangs. I will concede we have a lot of people in jail for minor drug offenses that would be better served with rehabilitation and that this is one issue that America needs to work on.  
&gt;the corruption and greed of our ""government""  
All governments suffer from some form of corruption. There isn't a single government out there that is 100% full of pure, innocent people that are doing everything soley out of the goodness of their hearts. We are less corrupt than average. If you want to help this, get into politics and don't be swayed by money. But good luck with that.  

&gt;drug epidemics kicked off entirely by the greed of big pharma  
I will concede that what happened with Purdue and Oxycotin is a scandal and that company and it's owners need sued into the ground and put into jail. But it's not like other countries don't have drug problems.   

&gt;rampant poverty  

Oh please. We're one of the richest nations on Earth, and our 'poor', our 'impoverished' are better off than the middle classes of most of the rest of the world. Did you know that 80% of the people who work on the planet make less than $1/day? You need to make less than $18,000 a year to be considered impoverished/poor in the USA. If you take someone who is making $15k/year and compare them to like, the 'impoverished' people in India or China, they would seem like they're doing just fine. Yes, we need to work on helping those people enrich themselves, but I laugh at the idea that there is 'rampant poverty' when there's literally thousands of people from Mexico, Latin America and South America risking their lives and risking rape every day for a chance to get into our country. Go live in Venezuela, Somalia, North India, Pakistan, Haiti or the Congo and then tell me about 'rampant poverty'.  

&gt;the racism  
America has a lot less racism than a lot of countries. Most Southeast Asian countries are extremely racist. Japan is extremely racist. Nobody is protesting for more diversity in Japan. America went from having slaves to the Civil Rights act in less than 100 years. There is no 'systemic racism' in America. If there is, show me the law that is racist.  

&gt;How about the militaries budget compared with the education budget  

I am 100% fine with having the most powerful military in the world. If we didn't, other countries would come in and rape, pillage, and destroy. Everything that you have is because of our military. The computer you're typing on. Your job. The chair you're sitting in. If it wasn't for our military, you would literally have people speaking a language you don't know breaking down your door, murdering you, raping your family, pillaging your belongings and burning down your house. You should be thanking your lucky stars we spend as much on our military as we do. Being the strongest and most powerful nation in the world is one reason why America is the greatest country in the world. We also need that kind of might not only to protect your life and belongings, but also to enforce our agenda across the world. The reason you have your wealth and all your stuff is because we can force other countries to play ball with our economic policies. If you don't like sitting on your throne of skulls drinking out of a skull goblet, then move to Haiti. Because right now you're literally reaping the benefits of living in an empire, crying about how we spend too much on our military, while you simultaneously reap the rewards of said military. You're riding on a chariot made from the bones of our enemies complaining about how bumpy the road is. All of the luxuries you enjoy are from conquest. So if you don't like that idea, then give up your luxuries. Otherwise you're just a huge hypocrite.  

&gt;universal healthcare  

Places that have universal healthcare also have much shittier healthcare where it takes weeks or months to be seen for anything. Did you know that for the rich, America is the #1 destination in the world for healthcare? Because we have the best. If you want to take care of everybody, then standards are going to go down, and someone has to pay for it. If you REALLY feel bad about us not having universal healthcare, then why don't you sell all of your possessions, get a medical degree, and open up a free clinic? Be the change that you want to see instead of just complaining about how unfair it is. Everything needs paid for, and you want universal healthcare paid for, you just don't want to pay for it.  

&gt;How about 170,000 dead from the worst response in the world to the Coronavirus   

A person would have to be an idiot if they think that other countries are accurately reporting. Do you think places like Afghanistan, India, Congo, South Africa, etc. whose most 'hospitals' don't even have electricity are accurately reporting the Coronavirus? Not to mention that number isn't even accurate because hospitals in the US get money every time they report a coronavirus death. Did you know that you don't have to be diagnosed with coronavirus for it to be considered a coronavirus death? You just have to show symptoms at the time of death. So literally if you have a cough, and you get hit by a bus and die, that's a ""coronavirus death"". We absolutely do not have the worst response, that's brainwashed democrat bullshit that is being spread to discredit our great president. Hint: Russia, China and India are most definitely *lying* about their numbers!  

&gt;We are an absolute laughing stock to the whole world  

We are the *envy* of the rest of the world. This is a lie that the radical left tries to push because they have TDS. If we are such a laughing stock, then why are there so many millions of people every day that are desperately trying to come here from all over the world? We are the greatest country in the world and other countries envy us, and they are jealous of us. If you think they're laughing at us, you've been brainwashed by the liberal controlled mass media. Why not go live someplace that isn't a laughingstock if you really think we are so bad?",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

She and her boyfriend were coming back from night fishing in his older Toyota Tundra and as he was passing a tractor trailer one of its rear tires blew and it careened into them. From what he told me, the truck rolled several times and came to a stop but he escaped with minor injuries while he thought my friend was dead as she was completely lifeless in the seat. She was life flighted to a hospital at 3 am and then after I'm not sure how many tests they discharged her at noon the same day with Perocet and three fractured ribs. Last night I went up there to have dinner with her, she claimed a near death experience and herself could not believe she was still alive given the truck which is an accordion from what she showed me. On top of that it occurred on what would have been my grandmother's 100th birthday, she met my gram once but didn't really know her.

&gt;It's about being short on your pills. Overtaking or selling. They do call ppl in for pill counts quite often. My dr never has but he can, you agree to it in the pain contract you sign, esp in a pain clinic.

[This one does not outright say common, but it addresses it](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/ic2e77/doctor_office_asks_laops_mom_to_bring_in_her/g20q4tb/):

&gt;The concern is that someone around the patient may be diverting medication (e.g, stealing mom's pills and selling them). This is a particular concern for end-of-life patients who may not be in a good position to voice their concerns.

[This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/ic2e77/doctor_office_asks_laops_mom_to_bring_in_her/):

&gt;pill counts are common, and are frequently a stipulation in narcotic contracts. should really be verified by two providers with redundant documentation.

[This is around the same time that you posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/ic2e77/doctor_office_asks_laops_mom_to_bring_in_her/g21537n/), so it might not have showed up yet:

&gt;Random pill counts are usually part of a pain contract- literally a contract you sign between you and your prescriber. In exchange for treating your pain with opioids, you agree to a LOT of things most people consider intrusive such as urine testing, random pill counts, and not obtaining opiates from any other provider, and only using a single approved pharmacy.

[My comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/ic2e77/doctor_office_asks_laops_mom_to_bring_in_her/g20944t/)

&gt;Yeah, it's generally reserved for long-term narcotic use in a pain management clinic. If you want to be kept on as a patient, you typically have to sign a contract that includes drug screens, pill counts, promising that you will not seek pain meds from any other doctors or change pharmacies frequently.

[And a reply to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/ic2e77/doctor_office_asks_laops_mom_to_bring_in_her/g20f2zo/)

&gt;My wife has worked at a clinic that had this kind of policy. I'm an attorney and I do criminal defense, so I frequently have contact with people who are drug addicts or otherwise have rather marginal lives.

[This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/ic2e77/doctor_office_asks_laops_mom_to_bring_in_her/g20nfey/)

&gt;So maybe this will answer your question. I used to work for a pain management clinic. The point of this clinic was to help people with chronic pain issues and get them meds (oxycodine, Dilaudid, morphine). We had a very strick refill policy and will only fill on 30 days from last script, unless that patient had a 60 day script, then it would be 60 days from last refill.

&gt;Part of our policy was to randomly call in a patient once every other month and do a pill count. But we would have the patient literally sit right next to use and the clinic manager as we counted.

&gt;Part of the reason. We did this was to ensure patients are following the usage we prescribed to them (Q4,Q6,Q8...). In the event someone came up short we would only refill on the pre determined calender date and write them a script for a medication that helps with withdrawals since they would run out early. If this was a habit of the person being short we would likely discharge them from the clinic.

[Another one](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/ic2e77/doctor_office_asks_laops_mom_to_bring_in_her/g20zclo/)

&gt;Im a pain patient due to disability. They DO sometimes call you in to count your meds. It's a very common thing to do for pain patients and it's written in the contract that you have to agree to and sign. They do it to make sure you're not short and overtaking or selling them. It's to help the opioid crisis.

 H√° 20 anos, em 18 de agosto de 2000, chegava √†s salas brasileiras [‚ÄúX-Men: O Filme‚Äù](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u3004.shtml), respons√°vel por transformar hist√≥rias em quadrinhos em verdadeiras impressoras de dinheiro em Hollywood. Inspirado nos mutantes da Marvel, o longa √© uma esp√©cie de av√¥ dos [filmes dos Vingadores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/04/vingadores-ultimato-e-o-filme-mais-chato-de-2019.shtml) e lan√ßou a atual onda de blockbusters de super-her√≥is.

 O filme, dirigido por Bryan Singer, n√£o foi o primeiro a adaptar HQs. [Tim Burton foi bem-sucedido com ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/ilustrada/144340-no-batman-de-tim-burton-mundo-do-mal-nao-tem-escapes.shtml) e ‚ÄúBatman: O Retorno‚Äù, de 1989 e 1992, e [Christopher Reeve](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u47787.shtml) foi levado ao estrelato ao incorporar o Super-Homem nas telonas.

 Mas nenhum filme havia al√ßado os super-her√≥is ao status de subg√™nero cinematogr√°fico, tampouco alcan√ßado um p√∫blico maior que o dos f√£s de quadrinhos e nerds, alcan√ßado uma gama de espectadores ampla o suficiente para ditar a maneira como os blockbusters seriam produzidos a partir de ent√£o.

  Os antecessores de ‚ÄúX-Men‚Äù tamb√©m n√£o compartilhavam de uma caracter√≠stica que a extinta 20th Century Fox tinha de sobra ‚Äìa ambi√ß√£o de transformar um √∫nico filme numa franquia com vida √∫til indeterminada, que extrapolasse as bilheterias para vender de bonequinhos e camisetas a bolinhos recheados.

 ‚ÄúA franquia dos 'X-Men' abriu espa√ßo para o que a gente v√™ hoje no cinema. Se n√£o houvesse 'X-Men', a gente n√£o teria os filmes dos Vingadores, por exemplo‚Äù, afirma Pedro Curi, coordenador do curso de cinema da Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing. ‚ÄúForam eles que inauguraram essa onda de filmes de her√≥is extremamente populares, que estimulam o p√∫blico a querer ver mais coisas dentro desses universos.‚Äù

 Dados da bilheteria americana mostram como ‚ÄúX-Men: O Filme‚Äù foi determinante. Nos 20 anos ap√≥s o longa, 42 filmes com super-her√≥is apareceram entre as dez maiores arrecada√ß√µes do ano nos Estados Unidos. Nas duas d√©cadas anteriores a ‚ÄúX-Men‚Äù, foram s√≥ cinco.

 Os retornos obtidos abriram os olhos da Marvel, que poucos anos antes [quase havia ido √† fal√™ncia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2015/04/1621240-marvel-tem-ressurreicao-vingadora-com-homem-de-ferro-e-seus-amigos.shtml). A empresa apostou tudo em sua pr√≥pria divis√£o cinematogr√°fica [at√© ser comprada pela Disney](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/11/disney-ameaca-arruinar-o-que-tornou-a-marvel-comics-especial-o-debate-politico.shtml) e se tornar uma das marcas mais valiosas do entretenimento mundial.

 ‚ÄúX-Men‚Äù tamb√©m foi a chance de apresentar a toda uma nova gera√ß√£o dois basti√µes da atua√ß√£o brit√¢nica ‚Äì[Patrick Stewart](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/07/eterno-capitao-picard-patrick-stewart-se-descola-de-franquias-de-heroi-em-drama.shtml) e Ian McKellen, que viveram Professor Xavier e Magneto. E o filme catapultou √† fama nomes que representam hoje a nata de Hollywood, como Hugh Jackman e Halle Berry ‚ÄîWolverine e Tempestade.

 ‚ÄúFoi um filme muito significativo. Acho que, a princ√≠pio, era uma aposta. E, de fato, quando n√≥s come√ßamos a filmar, o papel do Wolverine estava vago. Ent√£o, numa tarde, um jovem australiano encantador, Hugh Jackman, veio ao set e nos disse que faria um teste‚Äù, lembra Stewart. Foi assim que um dos personagens mais ic√¥nicos de Hollywood ganhou vida.

 Pedro Curi, o professor, afirma que a propor√ß√£o que a franquia tomou est√° muito al√©m do que se podia imaginar na virada do s√©culo. Mas a Fox foi cautelosa quando liberou os US$ 75 milh√µes, ou cerca de R$ 400 milh√µes, de or√ßamento da empreitada.

 ‚ÄúDe certa forma, foi uma aposta arriscada, porque levaram para o cinema algo que n√£o faziam ideia se as pessoas iriam gostar‚Äù, diz. Curi ressalta, no entanto, que os filmes se desviaram em grande medida da anima√ß√£o dos ""X-Men"" e das HQs, dando novas origens e arcos para os super-her√≥is. Um fator intr√≠nseco √† saga, por√©m, permaneceu intacto. E foi ele, segundo o pesquisador, que permitiu que ‚ÄúX-Men‚Äù extrapolasse seu nicho e dialogasse com tanta gente.

 ‚Äú‚ÄòX-Men‚Äô sempre teve uma narrativa muito inclusiva. Parte do princ√≠pio de que voc√™ pode ser diferente, de que a sua diferen√ßa n√£o √© um problema, mas uma qualidade. E, ao contr√°rio de outros her√≥is, os X-Men s√£o um coletivo, qualquer um pode ser mutante. Essa narrativa sobre minorias vai dialogar muito com temas que estavam sendo abordados nos anos 2000‚Äù, comenta o professor.

 Uma das cenas da franquia mais lembradas pelos f√£s veio de ‚ÄúX-Men 2‚Äù, quando Bobby, o Homem de Gelo, confronta seus pais sobre suas particularidades ‚Äîno que muita gente l√™ como um aceno √† comunidade LGBT. ‚ÄúQuando voc√™ soube que era um mutante?‚Äù, pergunta a m√£e do personagem.

 Quase US$ 2,5 bilh√µes, ou R$ 13,4 bilh√µes, e 12 filmes depois, a superfranquia parece dar sinais de desgaste. Por maior que seja seu legado, o futuro n√£o parece muito promissor ‚Äîem especial depois de uma verdadeira bagun√ßa feita na linha temporal dos personagens.

 A √∫ltima incurs√£o dos mutantes no cinema foi [‚ÄúF√™nix Negra‚Äù](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/06/sophie-turner-a-sansa-de-got-deixa-a-desejar-como-fenix-negra.shtml), no ano passado, um fracasso vergonhoso entre p√∫blico e cr√≠tica. J√° o 13¬∫ longa do universo, ‚ÄúOs Novos Mutantes‚Äù, foi adiado in√∫meras vezes por causa de rixas entre sua equipe criativa e o est√∫dio.

 Hugh Jackman, a fonte de carisma da franquia, se despediu de Wolverine no aclamado [‚ÄúLogan‚Äù](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2017/03/1862766-wolverine-vira-figura-paterna-em-logan-mas-continua-violento.shtml). Bryan Singer, diretor que concebeu a vers√£o cinematogr√°fica dos mutantes, est√° afundado em [den√∫ncias de ass√©dio sexual](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2017/12/1941733-diretor-de-x-men-bryan-singer-e-acusado-de-estuprar-menor-de-idade.shtml) e mau comportamento nos sets de filmagem.

 E, agora, a 20th Century Fox j√° n√£o existe mais e foi comprada pela Disney, que n√£o anunciou planos para seguir com os personagens. √â prov√°vel que eles retornem no futuro, mas em outro formato, talvez como puxadinhos dos Vingadores.

 ‚ÄúNesses 20 anos, a gente v√™ que, com o [Universo Cinematogr√°fico Marvel](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/04/quem-nunca-viu-um-filme-da-marvel-nao-tem-a-menor-chance-com-vingadores-ultimato.shtml), os X-Men v√£o para um segundo plano"", diz Curi. ""A franquia sofre um impacto, porque ela n√£o foi t√£o bem trabalhada e estruturada quanto os filmes dos Vingadores.""

It is LEATHAL. and if continued the chances of overdose is very high. 

And as far as being home or a hospital. 

At the hospital they MONITOR YOUR VITAL SIGNS. 
3 times a day or more and TREAT hypertension. 
You are in more of a controlled setting. I.e. you cant just pick up your phone and get dope.

If you need more meds they give them to you. No doctor is going to prescribe detox drugs to you for at home detox.

392,2020-08-17 21:14:01+00:00,"In New York City, a noncompliant Black man in police custody overdosed on fentayl and methamphetamine while resisting police and it very unfortunately resulted in Mr. Floyd‚Äôs death as a combination of his resisting police and the subsequent negligence on behalf of those police making the arrest.

In Louisville, no-knock plainclothes warrant issued by overly aggressive police in a home defended by a legal gun owner resulted in the negligent homicide of Breonna Taylor.

Many other Persons of Color have suffered or lost their lives to police acting outside of the law or beyond the reach of its grasp.

And so instead of holding those New York and Kentucky police accountable, or any of the others that are part of the same problem , y‚Äôall decided to burn down SEATTLE‚Äôs East Precinct and call for the resignation of Seattle‚Äôs first Black Police Chief.

And i have plenty of interactions with cops, and because i abide the law and don‚Äôt make my voice heard by hurting other people and their businesses, i do not have any hate for the cops.  Its called respect - for my fellow man, for the law, and for the people who keep order by enforcing that law.

I understand being fed up with police brutality and racial profiling and i am an absolute believer that reform to the police and the prison system in America is immediately necessary, but for whatever reason, the left thinks the only way to make that happen is to burn things to the ground and start anew...

I don‚Äôt support that shortsighted, immature viewpoint that we are so oppressed here we need to burn the system down and i will actively fight against that as an option because it‚Äôs not real social progress if it‚Äôs only enacted through destruction, intimidation, and violence.

Or shall we appease Hammurabi and we just blind everyone by burning the whole country to the ground?

With that said here is every fantasy series I have listened to that might help as a placeholder in order of my personal recommendation. 

1. king killer chronicles Patric Rothfuss- everyone should read this at some point.
2. Mother of learning- this book came close to scratching that itch for me it is a web novel with time travel/fantasy/progression elements set in a somewhat industrial era world. You can listen to the entire thing on YouTube.
3. Powder mage trilogy- military themed fantasy book set in an industrial era world. The magic system is interesting and the author has similar skill to will at bringing the characters to life without excessive backstory. Highly recommend this one.
4.thread Bear- I have read a lot of litrpg over the last 2 years and am usually disappointed at the end but not with this book! this book is simply put adorable. The book is set in a magical world with a game like leveling and class system. The main character is a teddy brought to life by a golem maker. The world it‚Äôs self is rather dark and brutal. The teddy then embarks on an epic journey to protect its owner a little girl. Fair warning Tis book may melt your hear.
5 dungeon lord- your usually litrpg iseki Situation but it‚Äôs well done.
6.Knight angel trilogy-brent weeks- a good fantasy book MC goes through a zero to hero situation similar to lindon.

8 anything brandon Sanderson.

They tried to, until mr Floyd kept resisting  and was continuously saying he couldn't breathe before they put him on the ground, while he was resisting arrest.

George Floyd was NOT killed by the cop so you lied about that. He was killed by being on fentanol, infected with Covid-19. He ASKED to be put on the ground. Literally. Derrick Chauvin is going to be fully exonerated. You probably haven't even seen the full body cam video the media hid from you.

Floyd was a known criminal with a violent history. Hinnant was an innocent 5 year old. One was murdered by a racist person. The other died accidentally while in police custody. The fact that one that didn't involve murder/execution caused riots is why the media is the enemy of the people. The full body cam video exonerates Chauvin and you probably haven't even watched it yet.",0

People have been allowing themselves to be led down the path of the progressive stack since Occupy Wallstreet.  I was there protesting and watched it happen.  Slowly it has crept up through universities and twitter into the mainstream.  Eventually people assume the only things of importance is race sex gender and sexuality.  This leads to people pushing for massive activism for these things in the media ignoring other issues.  This creates a distorted sense of magnitude of these issues since they are repeatedly shown over and over.  If you look at the statistics you see that they are not nearly as common as we are led to believe.  This leads to people thinking that police are out killing black people because of racism everyday which is simply not true.  9 black people were killed by police last year.  George Floyd video came out showing he was saying he couldn't breath before he even went to the ground.  He said he wanted to be on the ground and pushed himself onto the ground disobeying orders.  He was on a lethal dose of fentenyl and meth among other drugs.  People assumed because of the ideology of the time that he was murder when it turned out he was having a overdose while an officer happened to be using a approved (yet fucked up method)  Since then many more have been 20 killed, thousands injured almost a billion in property damages with countless businesses going under and entire families ruined.  So yes I think that this slippery slope of identity politics political correction and inter-sectional, critical race theory is responsible.

Police violence should be addressed but destroying everything this country was built on and making cities warzones during a pandemic where everyone is out of work is not a great plan.",1

Digo, en serio. Qu√© es?' 
Un verbo?' (yo te amo), 
Un sustantivo?' (ella estaba enamorada), 
Una verdad universal?' 
(Solo se necesita amor), 
Un ideal?' 
El hilo comun a todas las religiones?' 
Una parte de un plan?' 
Un fenomeno neurologico?' 
No hay escasez de respuestas mi amigo, algunas lo abarcan todo. 
Lo conquista todo. 
Es todo lo que necesitas. 
Lo es TODO. 
Estas son solo comparaciones, o formas de definirlo por contraste al decir que es mas importante que todo lo demas; pero acaso lo es?' 
Claro, el amor es mas importante que una Pizza, pero es acaso mas importante que un Hospial?' o la conciencia?' o una pizza con orilla de queso?' 
Sin importar cual sea tu respuesta solo lo estas clasificando no definiendo. 
Otro de los desafios para definir el amor es que con frecuencia lo definimos cuando estamos enamorados o desenamorados (Broken Heart), confiarias en alguien que acaba de sacarse la loteria para que te defina exactamente lo que es el dinero?' 
O tal vez pedirle a alguien que te defina que es un Oso cuando este fue atacado por uno en el pasado, o acaso el amor no es como sacarse la loteria?' o las rupturas no son similares al ataque de un Oso?' 
Estoy haciendo malas comparaciones?' 
Si, ese es mi punto. 
No estoy en mis cinco sentidos porque estoy enamorado, asi que Ja!' 
Bueno, ya. 
Posiblemente el amor es una de las cosas sobre las que mas se ha reflexionado en toda la historia de la humanidad. 
y, a pesar de siglos y siglos de obsesion, y estremecer tanto nuestro cabello aun nos deja perplejos. 
Con frecuencia escuchas a la gente decir que el amor es bueno, es grandioso. 
Un senitmiento hacia alguien que nunca habias sentido. 
Pero... los sentimentos son cambiantes; no son una base muy concreta para poder dar una definicion. 
A veces odias a la persona que amas. 
Ademas, vamos, ya lo has sentido antes, solo que en menor escala. 
Las relaciones con tu familia le da forma a las relaciones con tu pareja, y el amor por tu pareja puede que sea una relacion con dinamica propia, sea esta normal, o totalmente rara comparado al amor de tus padres y hermanos. 
El amor es tambien un conjunto de comportamientos que asociamos con este sentimiento vistas desde un contexto social: Tomarse de las manos, Besarnos, Abrazarnos, Demostraciones publicas de afecto, Salir, Casarse, Tener hijos o simplemente tener Sexo. 
Pero estos actos de amor son subjetivos y estan relacionados con la cultura. 
Puedes amar o ser alguien que no puede tener hijos, o no quieres tenerlos, que cre√© en el matrimonio pero tambien en el divorcio. 
Pero si el amor es algo que podamos definir, entonces como es que son cosas tan opuestas para tanta gente?' quiz√°s el amor solo esta en tu cabeza, un misterio personal que atraviesa tus neuronas y estalla creando una sensacion de recompensa en tu sistema nervioso. 
Talvez estas recompensas son adictivas. 
A lo mejor el amor es una adiccion permanete o temporal hacia una persona como la heroina mezclada con extasis. 
No quiero sonar curs√≠ como la mayor√≠a de  las canciones Pop. 
Hay evidencias que muestran que los quimicos en el cerebro estimulados por otra persona pueden hacer que desarrolles un habito por esa persona, la persona viene a satisfacer un deseo psicologico y vas queriendo mas y mas... 
Pero luego, a veces, ya sea lenta o repentinamente, ya no quieres mas. 
Te has desenamorado, perdiste la adiccion por el encantamiento. ¬øQue paso?' 
Ser√° que desarrollaste una tolerancia?' o llegaste al limite?' 
Por qu√© algunos amantes se mantienen adictos los unos a los otros toda la vida?' 
Quiz√° para crear nuevas vidas proliferando la especie?' 
Tal vez el amor es solo un metodo efectivo del ADN humano para lograr conservar la raza y as√≠ la naturaleza sigue su curso. 
Pero acaso el amor es solo eso?' o peor aun, es solo un invento?' Un concepto falso que hemos tratado de convencernos de que hay que mantener por un sentido de proposito falso?' 
Quiz√° sea un concepto, pero seamos mas precisos sobre lo del ""invento"". 
Porque el amor se invent√≥ a partir de la realidad de nuestras Experiencias, los Sentimientos, las Hormonas, Contexto Social y Nuestras Vidas. 
y esta creacion puede verse desde diferentes perspectivas: Cientifica, Emocional, Historia, Espiritual, inclusive Legal o simplemente Interpersonal. 
Si no hay dos personas iguales entonces por consiguiente  el amor de dos personas tampoco sera igual. 
Asi que en toda relacion amorosa hay mucho de que hablar y las parejas deben estar abiertas a escucharse o la relaci√≥n estara destinada a perecer. 
(Y m√°s teniendo en cuenta lo complicadas que son las mueres...) 
El amor siempre estar√° bajo discusi√≥n y por supuesto, en construcci√≥n. 
As√≠ que si no podemos definirlo, eso mi amigo es una buena se√±al; porque quiere decir que aun lo estamos haciendo. 
Alimentando nuestro ser para finalmente darle un sentido a nuestras vidas. 
Asi qu√© escucha lo que te tengo que decir y ve a dar y recibir amor.",1

432,2020-08-14 17:04:48+00:00,"Look, I personally think it's incredibly fraught to try and compare Australia to America in any regard because the countries are so completely different that you need a post-grad level understanding of the history/politics/law of both countries to be able to correct for the differences.

I wouldn't even know where to begin to parse how to apply what white, college educated, higher median Texans think about vaccinations could mean for Australians. I don't think there's actually any Australian population group that would map directly onto that group except for maybe some parts of Perth. 

&gt;Would those richer and more informed women not be more likely to have private healthcare and the ability to inform the practitioners of their wishes regarding birth?

My point is that the medical system is so bad that those women don't feel they can do that and are opting out. Private healthcare in Australia is extremely different to private health care in America, or anywhere else as far as I can tell. In America, you can forum shop for your doctor and simply dictate what medication and what treatment you want, and if your doctor doesn't listen, well you can find another doctor in network who will do what you say. In America, you can go straight to a specialist and 'referrals' from GPs are perfunctory. Here, there are heaps of procedures/drugs/treatments which are not available from GPs are require a referral. 

For instance, American GPs prescribe controlled drugs like xanax, oxycotin, adderall themselves. In Australia, there is no GP in their right mind that would do that, and adderall is illegal. For any those, a patient would have to goto a separate specialist. Psychotherapist, pain specialist/anesthetist, different psychotherapist. So what could be accomplished in an afternoon at an American GP would easily take 3-4 months, several GP visits, several visits to specialists (multiple if one turns you down), and hundreds of dollars. This weird kind of throttling/limiting applies to many many many treatments, not just drugs. In America, a GP will order an MRI no problem. Here, a GP would probably stretch things out a bit with multiple visits, then a useless x-ray, maybe a useless CT scan, before finally ordering an MRI.

The point of that is, 'private healthcare' in Australia is really just a shittier, more expensive version of the public healthcare option. There is no pay-and-get-your-way option unless you are very very wealthy. 

The private healthcare doctors have no obligation to do what patients say because they are not controlled. In America, doctors report to insurance bureaucrats. You can call up your insurance and scream your head off about a doctor and there will be consequences for them, financially. There is literally no such recourse here, so, it makes sense to me that women would seek out a system which does have a feedback system for criticism- home births. It's word-of-mouth and patients have agency.",1

Basically years-and-years ago, Carlsberg made a ""special brew"" called Special Brew. It had morphine in it, and it was the go-to for all alcoholics and war veterans (who were alcoholics). Eventually, the morphone got banned, but Carlsberg responded by making a 10% reinforced cider to be the new ""Special Brew"". These days, ""Special Brew"" is considered the hallmark drink of a particular type of acloholic, the kind that likes parks and benches, and owns a raggedy dog, and smells of piss. We refer to these toothless wonders as ""The Special Brew Crew"".

I need my meds to be able to move, and play with my son and live my fucking life. 

Should I go from the Oxy to the Morphine and then try to step off the Morphine with the Suboxone if needed?

What I meant by tolerate is having that drug be recreational legal and thereby more prominent and available in a society.

&gt;Legalize it and you won‚Äôt have the overdoses.

Think? So you think that if the governments regulates the drugs and makes sure the product is pure then it will be all fine and dandy huh ? Well let me tell you the far majority of people who overdose don‚Äôt overdose on laced drugs. The problem is these hard drugs are dangerous themselves and people shouldn‚Äôt fuck with them. Just look at all the people who overdose on prescription opioids. There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt allow the sale of oxycotin over the counter to anyone who wants it big brain.  Making these addictive and dangerous drugs more available would cause a skyrocket in use and then there would be far more people overdosing. It‚Äôs not rocket science. 


&gt;You won‚Äôt have meth labs blowing up neighborhoods. 

You are wrong for thinking that people wouldn‚Äôt make and sell unregulated drugs if those drugs were legally available. The scale effect applies here not the subtraction effect. There‚Äôs always going to be untaxed unregulated weed and everything else. 


&gt;The war on drugs failed and only made things worse. 


Cliche saying. Why is the war on drugs a failure exactly ? Because it didn‚Äôt get rid of drugs? Because people are always going to do drugs? It‚Äôs really a silly thing to call it a failure because the goal of the war on drugs is not to get rid of drugs, (obviously That‚Äôs impossible ), the goal Is to limit the drugs. There would more people doing these drugs if they were not prohibited. You can be against the war on drugs all you want but to call it a failure is misplaced. Call it wrong but not a failure.

A year ago, my father became very ill, and essentially, my mother became his sole caretaker. It was an extremely difficult time and she developed severe insomnia. She found out at one point that Valiums seemed to be the only thing that helped her get to sleep, but no matter how many doctors or psychiatrists she saw, they would never prescribe her any. 

Back in April, I went to the dentist to have a wisdom tooth extracted. I was then prescribed Oxycodone for pain. When I called mom to let her know that the extraction went well, she asked if they'd given me any painkillers and I told her what they'd given me. She said she was surprised that they had. 


As the days went on, I realized that the pain from my extracted tooth was next to non, so I never took any of the pills, but I kept them. Just stored away. One day, my mom drove the whole 40 minutes up to my apartment and knocked on my door. When I answered, she said she hadn't slept for days and was desperate. She asked me if I would give her any of my oxy pills so that she could use them to fall asleep. I told her no, I couldn't do that. I saw tears in her eyes, but she left. 


Last Sunday night, my mother called me on the phone sobbing. She said she was having a horrible migraine and was in agony. She asked me if I'd give her some of my oxy pills for her headache. I said I couldn't do it... She told me that I was cruel for not giving her any of the pills because she was in awful pain and hung up. 

Two nights later, my mother called me again, this time very curt. She wanted me to know that she went to the ER that same night and was told by the doctor that she‚Äôd had a cluster headache, which are very painful. She said the doctor still hadn't given her anything for the headache and that people were just very cruel because they won't even give out a single pill to help someone who is in pain. She told me that she just called to tell me that, then hung up. About an hour later, she called again, crying, and telling me that she didn't understand why I was being so cold and cruel to her. Then she got another call and quickly hung up again. 


All my life, I've always heard about how addictive opioids are, especially oxycodone and oxycodine. I never in my life wanted to be in a position where I would be handing oxy pills over to my own mother. When she asked, I just couldn't do it. It scared me because I don't know what it could lead to. And I'm not a doctor, so I don't know what these oxy pills could do or if they would have even worked at all. 

I don't know if I did the right thing. Part of me is wondering if I should have just given her the pills so that she would get some relief. It probably would have been harmless. My mother now believes that I've betrayed her and that I'm cold and cruel. 

AITA for not giving her the pills, even though she was experiencing a cluster headache and doctors just don't seem to ever be any help for her?

&gt;  
&gt;All that stress runs out of your body and oxycotin rushes in to replace it.  That hormone gives you a heroin-style sense of euphoria, and you quickly become addicted to it.

Oh my god, you've just described aspects of my relationship with my emotionally-abusive mother. I thought that rush of happiness and relief was me ""being a nice person."" Such a nice person that I didn't harbor a grudge for the hellish hours/days/weeks she'd just put me through, just felt instant forgiveness towards her as soon as she started acting nice to me again. I was ready to wipe the slate clean and start over, instantly. I thought that was me being optimistic and positive-thinking. And maybe some of it is, but now I see there could have been a physical reason for my reactions as well.

&gt; And why can't one believe that love exists if there's multiple ways of demonstrating its effects in the physical universe 

If i believe that rain comes from clouds, i would need to demonstrate that clouds exist *first* before i can say that rain comes from them. If i infer that rain comes from clouds simply because they happen to occur at the same time, that is merely a correlation, *not* a causation. 

Likewise if oxycotin levels in a human are high at some point, that does not in itself prove the existence of Love. A certain level of irrational belief is required to conclude that a bunch of correlations indicate a causation.

And i am willing to concede when it comes to love, God and other topics of a similar nature, i use a degree of irrational belief.

Ultimately, a strict adherence to rationality will lead to solipsism in my opinion. Nothing could be known for sure. We cannot know if we are a brain in a vat, or whether 15 minutes ago really occured. I think it is the most sensible view an atheist could hold.

the bands are growing rapidly, they are around my hips, traveling to my knees, both thighs, bum and lower back,
as they are growing the are getting tighter and are further restricting my movement around my hips and knees! (It‚Äôs scary) 

Iv really bad pain in my joints and my bones and I can‚Äôt stretch the area to relieve the pain.
it is making me very irritable. 

I don‚Äôt like opioids or relaxers but Im have to take them. I‚Äôm hoping to get medical marijuana to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals in my body but it‚Äôs illegal in Ireland so I‚Äôm struggling. 

I had a biopsy, my doc said there was cell changes under the bands, so he does not think it is morphea which I was originally diagnosed with, he has diagnosed stiff skin syndrome, and has prescribed methotrexate with the plan to change to CellCept and UV A1 light treatment to hopefully soften the tight bands on my body .",1

Late May a black man named George Floyd is killed. Only video we have is 8:47 of a cop kneeling on Floyd's neck as Floyd yells ""I can't breathe"". Riots ensue, people want justice, etc. However it should be noted that there were some peaceful protests.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after Floyd, a man named Rayshard Brooks is shot and killed in Atlanta Georgia for taking a cop's taser and discharging it at said cop. People later burned down the fast food place he was shot at.

&amp;#x200B;

Also during this time 2 autopsies are held for Floyd. 1 says he died of the cop kneeling on him, the other says he died of a drug overdose due to having more than 4x the lethal dose of Fetanyl in his system. It also comes out that Floyd has an extensive criminal history. The worst crime being holding a gun to a woman during a house invasion.

&amp;#x200B;

Early-mid June the idea of ""defunding"" the police comes in. people say they want to move the budget elsewhere away from services like ""militarization"" and say to send social workers into more crimes like suicides. At this point Minneapolis is the most talked about place. People want defunded police and are anti ""systemic racism""

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime in June a mob takes over 6 city blocks in Seattle Washington. This area becomes know as CHAZ/CHOP. Chaz is an ""autonomous zone"" aka a real life Purge movie. People are getting raped and robbed everywhere everyday. When the mayor is asked to end Chaz, she says its mostly peaceful and calls it ""the summer of love"".

&amp;#x200B;

In a matter of a few weeks there are anywhere from 2-5 (I forgot the exact number) murders in Chaz most of which are committed by the Chaz ""police"" aka people with guns against innocent teens. Eventually Chaz is shut down when people threaten to take it to the mayor's house. By this point people want to defund and/or abolish the police entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

Among all of this stuff is happening all over the map. Sports teams are changing names, food brands are changing mascots, just a bunch of useless changes to make companies look good. The most important thing to come out of this (to me) is the NFL saying they will play the ""Black national anthem"" before the official national anthem. Where's the black nation? Idk you tell me.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of July is un-eventful until around the middle where Portland Oregon is getting worse by the day. They'd been rioting since the beginning of this whole thing. Eventually they try to burn down a federal courthouse, and Trump sends in the federal agents to protect the building. They allegedly sent in unmarked rental vans that would arrest people. This caused people to start using terms like Dictator, fascist, and gestapo.

&amp;#x200B;

Portland only gets worse. People start using very powerful lasers to blind police, throwing frozen water bottles and fireworks, as well as the usual burning of buildings. Multiple groups of people (most notably the ""wall of moms"" start blocking the feds, but are unsuccessful. This goes on for a while. Even today.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this month the body camera footage for Floyd is released and shows that Floyd resisted arrest, was obviously high as a kite, and freaked out a lot, making some (but sadly very few) change their minds on the rioting. As of now the main goal of the movement is just to wreak as much havoc as possible before someone snaps and starts a civil war.

Like how during prohibition moonshine was the only thing on the market so that‚Äôs what people drank, but today, since alcohol is legal, the average person overwhelmingly prefers to drink beer or wine.  Since weed has been legal I‚Äôve seen way way more low THC or equal parts CBD/THC cannabis varieties where before weed was almost entirely bred to be strong as hell. 

So right now meth and fentany/heroin are the only things on the market so that‚Äôs what users use, were things legal those who wanted to use would likely gravitate towards lower strength lower harm variations. Hardcore addicts would still probably want the strongest stuff, just like most alcoholics drink hard liquor, but as we know we have loads of addicts doing that already. They would be at significantly less risk of overdose if they reliably knew what it was they were taking, and have a much better chance of entering recovery if their every waking minute and resource didn‚Äôt need to be spent seeking to get their daily fix. 

People are not dumb, alcohol can be highly addictive, but very few drinkers (even those who really like drink) actually become full blown alcoholics. I think it would be a similar story if other drugs were legal.",1

Yep:  **that was the point.**

He's an abuser in a hurry, which was your good luck here.  Abusers usually take their time, but this guy was inpatient:  he wanted you isolated and trauma bonded before you even knew his middle name.

The fact that you're questioning whether you are ""right"" to be worried is obviously worrying because abusers can always sense the likely victims in their midst--that is, they look for people with uncertain self-esteem.  If that describes you, strongly consider getting therapy to help you deal with this. 

In the meantime, read *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft.  You'll also want to visit loveisrespect and thehotline to read up on abuse, as well as researching the totems of abuse:

* lovebombing

* gaslighting

* trauma bonding

* Issendai sick systems

* cycle of abuse

He lovebombed you and was setting in place a sick system in order to provoke trauma bonding.  What he's doing now, stonewalling you?  It makes you feel bad, makes you feel anxious, makes you worry that you are going to be dumped...all those turbulent bad feels, and then suddenly he contacts you!  He's forgiven  you!  He's happy with you again!

All that stress runs out of your body and oxycotin rushes in to replace it.  That hormone gives you a heroin-style sense of euphoria, and you quickly become addicted to it.  Did you ever meet a victim of abuse who defended her relationship by saying something like, ""Yeah, things can be bad with Frank, but when they're good, THEY'RE SO GOOD!""?  

That's the addiction talking.  And like every other kind of addiction, the oxytocin addiction lies to you in order to stay close to its dealer.  It's insidious and hard to kick.  Imagine if you were a junkie and this guy was the only person dealing heroin in the area:  you would do anything and everything to keep the drug coming.

It's only been TWO WEEKS and you're already flirting with trauma bonding; just imagine how bad the cravings will be in *two months.*

Oh, and you know why he hates his ex?  **Because she left him.**  That's probably why he's speeding up the creation of the cycle of abuse, you know:  he wants to make sure that you have no chance to walk away from him.

This dude is scary and malign.  Gather up Team You and prepare for some awful blowback when you break up with him, up to and including threats of suicide (these guys *always* threaten suicide).

Break up by text.  Do not meet him to give him ""closure.""  Dump him, then block him.  If/when he shows up on your doorstep, *do not let him in.*  If he won't leave, *call the cops.*

I hope it doesn't come to that, but be prepared.",1

2) At no point was Floyd any kind of threat to the police. At no point was he in any way meaningfully resisting arrest, he couldn't have been as he was 1) not of sound mind and 2) clearly outnumbered 1-4 and already weak due to the influence of a depressant drug. They could have, and obviously did, restrain him very easily if they wanted to. 

While I agree with your message that police brutality shouldn't happen to anyone, you chose a bad example. George Floyd wasn't in the wrong here. We shouldn't be using the police to deal with drug addicts. We shouldn't be sending armed, trigger happy police to someone who (allegedly) had committed a nonviolent crime like using a counterfeit bill...

Dude fuck off. The cop tells him to put both hands on the wheel but he's HIDING HIS RIGHT HAND?

You know why he's doing this? Because he's high as fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

But the cop needs to discern (literally HIS LIFE DEPENDS ON IT) if George is just a \*moron\* and can't follow basic instructions or if he's high as a kite. The cop figures out he's high and explains to George, I can't see your right hand, you need to put it on the wheel. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was personally impressed by the cops situational awareness and experience. I would've immediately assumed malicious intent. ""I'm literally looking you in the eye with a gun and telling you to show me both your hands, and you won't? Why not? Probably has a gun and doesn't want to be arrested""

The only bone I have to pick is that you speak with certainty in paragraph two.  I don't know what killed Floyd.  From what I understand there are at least four factors at play and I don't know what to what extent each factor played a part in his death, if any.  And the four factors I've heard about is not exhaustive, because I am not directly involved in the matter.

For example, for the sake of argument lets put forth a scenario where we somehow can look into the future and we found that Floyd was going to die of an overdose that day, or from complications from Covid, even if the police didn't show up.  Lets further say that the police were completely unreasonable in restraining him.  If he was going to die anyway, how much blame can you assign to the police's actions in the context of his death?  What percentage of responsibility can you assign to the fact he was being restrained to the unfortunate outcome?  In that scenario, the restraint would be the straw that broke the camel's back.  Even though its a hypothetical, the fact is that we don't know what extent the fentenyl (killed prince), covid (killed many), meth (don't even go there), and restraint each played in bringing about his death.  If we aren't certain about any of this, we certainly can't say which factor is the primary factor, we certainly can't make any conclusions about a single cause that brought about his death.

I'm just trying to be fair to everyone here instead of going with the popular opinion and getting worked up emotionally after watching a raw video of someone dying, like many others do.  If you were to ask me about Philando Castile, my opinion would be much different and I think Yanez's punishment should be pretty medieval at the hands of anyone who loved him.",1

Floyd had 11 times the lethal dose of Fetanyl in his system and was on other drugs as well at the time such as Meth. He asked police to lay on the ground since he didn't want to sit in the cruiser for whatever reason. The store owner said Floyd had multiple fake bills and also felt threatened. The cops put their guns away when Floyd showed them his hands.

In the bodycam footage you can watch the knee position of the main officer. Watch that for yourself and contrast it with the other angle of the other video. Make out what you will regarding him being on Floyd's neck. Also the autopsy showed to bruising to his neck. Floyd went to the hospital, had his blood drawn, and died about half an hour later from cardiopulminary arrest (aka heart attack). He did not die at the scene.

On the face of it you would think ""No, they cant legalize drugs because then everyone will be on heroin/meth/crack/etc""

If you think this then by that logic if drugs become legal then you will be on all these drugs. If drugs were made legal tomorrow would you start shooting up tomorrow? Obviously not. If someone wants too do drugs they will do them whether they are legal or not. Why dont people understand this. It's absolutely insane to me. I haven't met a single person. In my life who was like ""Man, I want some heroin, but that's against the law so I'm not gonna do that""

Of course this is not a new argument and no doubt it has been said here.. But I have never heard anyone effectively refute it. Also I would argue that if heroin had been legal for say the past 20 years then fentanyl would not be killing poor addicts like it is now. If heroin was regulated then people could get the drug they wanted as opposed to who knows what.

I would also argue that if meth had been legal for 20 years then it would still be the good stuff. For youngster and non-drug users, meth has changed over the years. The stuff going around nowadays (mexican cartel dope) while extremely cheap makes people go crazy a lot faster. In all honesty I dont have any evidence for this other than personal experience and observation.

To all the people that say ""I do such and such drug and I'm fine so that drug should be legal, but not the bad drugs"" my question to you is why do you get to decide which ones are ok and which ones aren't? I think the obvious answer is the media, and living a sheltered life. You hear all the bad reports and you see all the all the crazy homeless people. Maybe you had a friend or family member that had to battle these demone. Maybe someone you loved died and if that's the case my heart goes out to you (I swear to god I'm crying like a bitch right now). It hurts. It fucking sucks. But if you are in the ""streets"" you can name plenty of people that use various drugs responsibly you just dont ever hear about it because these people have to keep it a secret from everybody. For those that aren't in the ""know"" you would be surprised at how many people do hard drugs. It's not just junkies, thugs, and crazy homelsess people. That's just the only people that you know that do it because they make it obvious.

I'm sorry y'all, I lost my train of thought thinking about friends that have passed on. I am bored though and would love to debate a sensible person on this

Just to put it out there, I have done all the main street drugs multiple times. I have been addicted to hydromorphone/morohine/hydrocodone for about a year. IV coke/crack 6 months/ meth 15 years. I have been fairly clean for 5 years with a few meth relapses (some really bad in the past 2 years) but haven't done anything except daily marijuana use and occasional beer for the past 3 months",1

These factors reduced his credibility when he was claiming he can't breathe while on the ground that he was begging to be on, instead of the car. I think it's reasonable to not automatically take his word for it at first, but it's also unreasonable to do what the cop did for as long as he did it.

You shouldnt smoke weed while pregnant, just like how you should check the wires of a light switch for a current even after you flip the breaker. Yeah, the breaker is flipped and all the lights turned off, but you cant be 100% it's on a different breaker. I smoke weed every day, but I'm going to quit with my wife when we ha e a baby because WHAT I DONT KNOW COULD FUCK UP MY KID.

That being said, this thread is about if weed during pregnancy is bad. (Cant be sure. Probably...so play it safe and dont) but stfu if you are here to try and pretend you are better than people who smoke weed, or of you are here to belittle people who smoke cuz you think they are all dumb ass hippies. I can literally see the two extremes in this thread. Weed idiots who are so proud they want to ignore studies that find negative effects (albeit not this study, as it is not conclusive. But the premise of the title is a no brainer) and then there is the  ""I'm so much greater than thou"" non weed smokers who are just as much in the dark about the negatives of smoking weed as the weed idiots are as to the positives.

I smoke weed almost every day, for years now. I dont laze around, I get shit done. I dont smoke on the job. I dont smoke next to kids. I have stopped smoking several times for jobs and I never had withdrawals beyond a mild headache for a day.

 People who ""cant"" stop smoking, simply dont want to stop. They arent ""addicted"". You may think I'm dumb for saying so, but as a person who has had many people close to me fall into addiction (alchohol, heroin, and meth) the shit they struggle with in terms of withdrawal and the  uncontrollable desire for more is NOTHING like quitting weed. I've never met a person who was willing to give up eveything (job, home, family, friends, kids, you name it) just for one more hit of weed. I sadly know may people who have done so for alcohol, meth and haroin. If you think a person is addicted to weed, then you have no idea what real addiction looks like. If you want to talk about the habitual aspects of weed, yes you can gain a pretty intense habbit of smoking weed. Just like anything you can consume, if you consume a lot over time your body will start to expect/want it. That's not quite the same as ""addiction"".",1

I may very well be wrong but I don't know if vets take such an oath.

There's also religious reasons. Despite ""separation of church and state"" we are still very much a Christian nation. In God we trust, Christmas being our biggest holiday, i.e. And the Bible is very clear about not killing and not killing oneself. So what happens to a doctor if they go in and give this patient a legal dose of morphene, it's possible to argue (should Christianity be true) that doctor is bound for Hell.

And then secondly is because our society is much more complex than that of any animal. There's a reason I could kill a dog and a person and I wouldn't go to trail as ""Dog Murderer suspect"" and face life in prison.

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it.

[You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul)

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

&gt;Based on the above figures, one can calculate that the lethal dose for fentanyl is approximately 100 times less than the lethal dose for morphine. In addition, when individuals mix drugs, such as fentanyl dosing in conjunction with heroin, the potential amount of a lethal dose of fentanyl is drastically reduced to the point of being so small that normal individuals might not be able to measure it.

Floyd had 11 times the lethal dose of Fetanyl in his system and was on other drugs as well at the time such as Meth. He asked police to lay on the ground since he didn't want to sit in the cruiser for whatever reason. The store owner said Floyd had multiple fake bills and also felt threatened. The cops put their guns away when Floyd showed them his hands.

In the bodycam footage you can watch the knee position of the main officer. Watch that for yourself and contrast it with the other angle of the other video. Floyd went to the hospital, had his blood drawn, and died about half an hour later from cardiopulminary arrest (aka heart attack). He did not die at the scene.

The common arguments are:

- ""He was on drugs!"" Which is irrelevant. Cops are expected to arrest drunk, drugged, or otherwise mentally impaired people all the time without murdering them.

- ""He said he couldn't breathe even before there was a knee on his neck!"" Sooooo ... Chauvin put his knee on the neck of a guy who was already having breathing problems. And this is supposed to be in favor of Chauvin? Whut?

- ""He was resisting arrest!"" A bit, yeah. But once he was handcuffed and on the ground it becomes irrelevant. Are you telling me that a handcuffed guy lying on the ground is such a threat that the only option 4 cops present had was to kill him? That's obvious nonsense.

One thing I still haven't any of these dipshits mention is the beginning of that bodycam footage. Floyd is sitting in his car, the cops come up to him. He's obviously unarmed and not a threat to anyone at that moment, but the first thing Chauvin does is pull out his gun and point it at Floyd. Just instant unjustified escalation. He then starts giving Floyd various conflicting orders - hands on the steering wheel, hands on your head, etc. So one minute Floyd is sitting in his car, the next he has a gun aimed at him and is playing a deadly version of Simon Says. Combine that with being on fentanol and obviously he had a panic attack - thus the ""I can't breathe"" comments and eventual resisting.",3

That's where we differ I guess, I focus more on the choices he made that led to his death (the jumping in front of the train) while you are looking at the specific cause (the train striking him).

One of those things is officer intent.  If a suspect has been screaming he can't breathe for twenty minutes without any physical restraint to his breathing, you're probably not going to think he's in grave danger when he says it while on the ground.

Furthermore, when we talk about ""Well the officers should de-escalate"" and this video shows 10+ minutes of officers trying to calm him down, not putting weapons on him (as soon as he put his hands on the wheel and stopped reaching around the car, the cop put his gun away and never took it back out), telling him that they're going to put him in the car and roll the windows down for him as well as stay with him per his request, it kinda undercuts the narrative that they escalated the situation.

And then of course there is stark evidence of something going on in his system.  From the jump he's talking about getting shot, being claustrophobic, screaming he's going to die, and then the tox report on the guy shows huge amounts of fetanyl and shit in it.  Tends to lead to the conclusion that this probably had something to do with his breathing, since he couldn't breathe even when standing with nobody on him.

554,2020-08-10 06:01:03+00:00,"I don't know anything about the healthcare system in Scandinavia, so I trust your analysis. As an American, I do know that I have never been able to afford health insurance here. Even through my employer, who offers a so-called decent health insurance policy, one third of my paycheck each month would go to it. And as for mediocre treatment, I can assure you, the treatments here are mostly mediocre as well. It's all about the doctor you find. Some are very good, but most are not.

Case and point: My husband (also with no insurance) had a bulged disc causing unspeakable sciatic nerve pain. The best back pain specialist we could find recommended physical therapy and refused to prescribe any pain relievers beyond what you can get over the counter. As he was writhing in pain, unable to walk, they treated him as if he was a drug addict looking for opioids. Rather than try to make the pain manageable, this doctor's office refused our calls for help when he was doubled up on the floor screaming, and told us to go to the hospital emergency room. We did. I was barely able to drag him to the car to get to the ER. Calling an ambulance was never an option. Once we got to the hospital and finally got a room, the nurse yelled at him for moaning in pain too much and scaring the other patients. They gave him a steriod shot, 4 oxycotin pills, a presciption for Ibuprofen (which is readily available without one), and sent us on our way. The cost was 4,000 dollars. After months of visits, fighting, begging, and pleading, the specialist ""doctor"" we were seeing finally ordered a cortisone shot. Fortunately, that meant my husband was referred to a doctor who could administer this shot. The new doctor, Dr. Billy, immediately ordered an MRI. Upon seeing the results, he told us that my husband's disc bulge was so bad that first year medical students would be able to identify it without any training. This doctor was well-informed and compassionate, a God send. The steroid shot only worked for a few weeks. But Dr. Billy also explained the difference between drugs like Oxycontin, which just blocks pain receptors and are super addictive opiods (which my husband didn't want in the first place), and prescribed a specific nerve drug called Gabapentin that calms the pain and makes my husbands life manageable. Not only that, he is willing to refill the prescription with just a phone call because he understands that we don't have the means to pay for regular visits. By the end we had racked up close to $8,000 in medical bills. All to just get the one prescription that makes life livable.

Point being, the American healthcare system is as dependent on the doctor you get as anywhere else. It just costs a whole lot more to get there.",1

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts.

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution.

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

First time poster, long time reader. Re-uploaded due to issues with wording, so if this somehow repeated in the thread I‚Äôm sorry. This is still very new to me.

This just happened and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just overreacting or if this is something that I  have a right to get upset over.

I‚Äôm staying with my father due to COVID-19 and having just graduated college. We we‚Äôre just having dinner with my grandmother when the topic of her physical therapy came up. The conversation went nicely right up until my father made a comment like ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs good you‚Äôre doing physical therapy. Most doctors just sell you Happy Little Pills and tell you it‚Äôll make you better when it won‚Äôt‚Äù

For some context, I am someone who has had lifelong severe sleep issues that require medication (on top of a few other things that I feel are personal and private). My father has NEVER wanted me on medication, even going so far as to tell me growing up that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just being over dramatic‚Äù and ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have anything wrong with you‚Äù when I clearly did. It took me telling an outside influence that I was incredibly unhappy and flunking out of school due to my worsening mental health, physical pain, and sleeping 0-3 hours a night for them to Force him to let me get medicine for them. It wasn‚Äôt an issue of money, or insurance, just him refusing to let me get help. This is also not a comment he only made in the past, as this is the third time in the last few weeks Alone that he‚Äôs made similar comments to or around me. Even though he picks up my medication for me sometimes, he makes comments whenever I talk about any side effects or issues with them as though he‚Äôs been right all along.

Naturally, when he made the comment at the dinner table, I curtly told him ‚Äúmedicine does help sometimes, and doctors aren‚Äôt all after money‚Äù and left. He later came into the room I was in to confront me

He told me that he ‚Äúonly meant oxycotin, not your medicine‚Äù and that I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt act like I‚Äôm an asshole‚Äù

I asked him how I would know what he was referring to, and that his comment hurt me because he hasn‚Äôt been supportive before and that this wasn‚Äôt the first time he made comments like this. And finished with ‚Äúhow do you think it makes me feel to hear you say comments like that, especially when you don‚Äôt specify‚Äù

He got angry, and turned it around on me. He said ‚Äúand how do you think *I* feel when you treat me like I‚Äôm an asshole! I pick up your meds for you!‚Äù (He‚Äôs picked them up once for me in the last 6 months). He promptly told me that this was my fault for being upset over nothing, and stormed out. 

AITA? I genuinely like I have a right to be upset, especially when he refused to acknowledge me telling him that this thing hurt me, and tried to make himself look like the true victim. But part of me worries that I‚Äôm being overdramatic like he said. All I know is that I‚Äôm hurt and (once again, when it comes to him) left without any resolve.

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.

The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues.

It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result.

606,2020-08-07 19:24:30+00:00,"Morphea is a subtype of scleroderma so this is the correct subreddit.   


There are several different forms of morphea and probably even some that havent been documented. The main thing to note with morphea is it will never result in organ invoment. Sadly because the biopsy for any form of scleroderma can come back positive for morphea lots get misdiagnosed when they actually have a systemic form of the disease. Thats why its very important for diagnosis and treatment to be carried out by a scleroderma specialist. This is usually a rheumitologist that speicializes in Scleroderma. Some signs of systemic desease are: GERD/acid reflux, raynauds, GI issues, shortness of breath, skin thickening or sclerodactyly (morphea wont ever effect fingers see the scleroderma foundation youtube video from the scleroderma conferences these speaches are done by doctors. ""Localized scleroderma (morphea) by the Scleroderma foundation on youtube""), PAH, lung fibrosis or fibrosis of internal organs. Morphea will only ever effect the skin and some underlying tissues of those with the deep version. Lots of us feel joint pain this can be globally or near our effected areas, fatigue is common it can be just general fatigue or muscle fatigue, we should all be expericing a form of skin thickening resulting from the excesses collagen in the area, this can also result in disfingerment and mobility issues.   


As for your rheumitologist if they are not a specialist in scleroderma please try to find one. It will be better for you in the long run. As for nipple involvment I havent seen anyone mention it before but checkout the facebook gruops: Morphea, Scleroderma, Scleroderma support group. Also throat involvment isnt a thing with morphea but the systemic forms this can be acid relucx or mobility issues of the esophagus that result in swallowing issues. Blood work isnt really used to diagnosis what type of scleroderma it can help but they look more for clincial symptoms it can mostly help once you have a label for progression since msot with certain antibodies progress a bit more similarily.   


I personally had alot of joint pain around my effected ares so hip, knee, ankle, and toes. However, my knee was  the worst i woul be limping pretty badly but I wasnt super conerned I had rapid spreading of my skin being effected. It started with a loonie sized ""bruise"" that turned out to be a morphea plaque. I noticed the bruise stick around for a month and went thats odd but I have anemia so ill give it more time to heal. Then I noticed it stay for a month more and was now spreading and feeling thick this is when alarm bells went off and I scheduled an appointment with my GP for after my finals cause I thought if its cancer I need to finish my finals first. She was super facinated when she saw it and had no idea since it had a yellow tinge we thought my fat was doing something weird. She did a deep biopsie since we werent sure how deep it effected me. It came back postive for morphea and again lets not that means you can have anyform but neither I or my GP knew that at the time and she scheduled me to see a rheumy. I saw my rheumy Feb 14 she told me the biopsy actually only means I can have any form of scleroderma and she asked me alot of questions about all the common systemic symptoms which i wasnt aware of at the time I thought I had morphea and was very thnakful. She told me because I had head to toe intense itching and rapid progression she was leaning systemic scleroderma so we did all my baseline testing echo, PFT, xray of my lungs. She told me before I left id be starting methotextrate in a week if I was okay with that treatment and if it was morphea or systemic shed be treating it the same since my spreading was so intense. Mine continued to spread for a month or two but I noticed it had slowed down. She saw me every month she wanted to make sure she got it under control. As a young female at 22 I was thankful I had read how serious systemic scleroderma could be. More of my blood tests came back and I didnt have any other symptoms so right now my label is morphea but we arent sure if we just caught it super early and stopped it in its tracks so were being careful about it. My joint pain was still around with my methotextrate so we added hydroxychloriquine which stopped all joint pain that was left. I was also on presidone for a month to knock me out fo a flare.

A patient on buprenorphine should \*never\* have to stop taking their bup because of surgery. Never. An anesthesiologist is more than qualified to determine the best route of anesthesia based on a patients medical history, and properly monitor the patient while under to mitigate any possible adverse outcomes. Opioids do NOT have to be used for anesthesia to be effective so the argument about the buprenorphine interfering with the efficacy of fentanyl is bullshit. First of all, no it doesn't. Fentanyl is one of the few drugs that has a higher affinity for the opioid receptor than bup does. And secondly, if they're really that afraid then don't use fentanyl... It's really and truly that simple. The problem lies in (again) a profound lack of understanding of addiction and addiction medicine which leads to surgeons and anesthesiologists developing warped ideas of what it means for a patient to be on Suboxone. Taking someone off of this medication for surgery where an anesthesiologist is intently monitoring all blood gases and vitals is absurd, and they should realize that the withdrawals the patient will experience will inhibit healing thereby INCREASING surgical risk. But they don't realize this. They honestly think that it's best to take someone off of buprenorphine for 24 or more hours before surgery and then treat them with a typical course of opioid pain management which is often 2-4mg morphine or dilaudid every 3-4 hours or 5-10mg perocet every 4-6 hours. Even if the patient has been maintained on say 16mg buprenorphine for any significant amount of time. That post surgical ""pain management"" is bullshit for someone maintained on buprenorphine or methadone for that matter. ALL surgical patients should be maintained on their USUAL dose of bup or methadone and any pain medication should be used on top of that.",2

You dont get immune to dhc you just get s tolerance after yrs and its the classic notion that we chase a high we will never capture again. Maybe take a tolerance break.. Strangely enoughr i use subutex for that cuz the cross tolerance isnt the same like say if i switched to MSContin or Oxy for a week my tolerance woukd get higher but cuz subutex is a weird one its a partial opioid agonist and partial opioid antagonist whereas Dhc is a full agonist like morph oxy and heroin. i usually switch to snorting 4mg lines of sub twice a day for 5 or 6 days once a month and its like my DHC tolerance halves in just shy of a week and my 2 x120s i get scripted crushed up, soaked in cola overnjght and downed in the mornjng gets me buzzing again. For another week or so then i need to get more 120s elsewhere and then when they run.out i switch to sub for.5 or 6 days..been doing that for yrs now. Jimbo taught me that trick.

Lol is that not painfully evident? That‚Äôs been the problem with how the war on drugs has been conducted. Putting weed in the same category as all these substances that are obviously so much worse because it‚Äôs deemed a ‚Äú gateway drug‚Äù 

Weed is in its own different world apart from coke, heroin and meth. It‚Äôs not even close.

&gt;I can buy crystal meth right now if I wanted  to. It has been made very apparent that policing addicts and criminalizing their disease has been a massive waste of government funds and recourses and the Drug Crisis is worse than it‚Äôs ever been.

I really hope you don‚Äôt ever try meth dude. And what are you trying to say by saying you could buy meth right now? I think I see what argument you are throng to Make here. Meth being prohibited keeps a lot of people from not doing it, don‚Äôt act otherwise. It‚Äôs not rocket science, If something is legally available, advertised, not combated,  legitimate in a society, and thus more prominent and any citizen can know where to get it, there‚Äôs going to more way more use of that product. The notion that since  people are going do drugs regardless if they are illegal is a really terrible argument against drugs being prohibited.


&gt;It has been made very apparent that policing addicts and criminalizing their disease has been a massive waste of government funds and recourses and the Drug Crisis is worse than it‚Äôs ever been.

I don‚Äôt think anyone should go to prison for merely being a drug user. I‚Äôm for decriminalization. (You know it‚Äôs really something how so many people don‚Äôt know the difference between legalization and decriminalization) I say If cops find illicit drugs then they should be confiscated and that person should get a short jail stay with medical treatment provided. No harsh punishment. It should be about getting people clean and getting drugs off the street. Treat the users, punish the dealers. 

I live in the Bay Area and the issue is that we seem to think it‚Äôs compassionate to allow addicts to be addicts and just allow them to wander around the streets like zombies while allowing an open playground basically for scumbag smack and crank dealers. If anything the problem is the lack of a war of drugs in this case. If we only we could decide to do the sensible thing and put all these poor bastards we see on the streets in treatment and also start getting tough on the dealers, what a world of difference that would make. If only we could stop not confronting the problem. 

A big investment in Mandatory treatment and revival of mental health institutions would really help to a great degree. It‚Äôs not compassionate to just say fuck it when it comes to addicts and mentally it people. 


&gt;I‚Äôm not saying we should be all able to pop to a shop and buy an 8-ball. 

Well good you got common sense. Only a moron would think that would be a good idea. Alcohol causes a lot of harm but the thing is that‚Äôs because so many people do alcohol, way more people drink alcohol than do cocaine obviously because It‚Äôs a legal, very popular and cultural substance that the vast majority of people can consume without it ever being an issue-
The same can not be said for cocaine. A world where even half as many people did cocaine, meth or heroin as much as alcohol would not be pretty. We definitely don‚Äôt want that. 


&gt;But maybe take some of the funds allocated to the War on Drugs and use them instead to have hard drugs (Coke, Heroin, Meth, Crack, PCP, etc), manufactured in FDA regulated labs by actual scientists. Have said drugs be administered to addicts by Doctors and Nurses via free clinics. Give addicts a safe and sterile environment to use without fear of prosecution. Very much like a Methadone clinic. At the very least, a vast majority of them will stop dying. Offer government funded rehab for any addict who‚Äôs a patient. Start on a small scale to see if this could be a possible step in the right direction. I feel like that‚Äôs out best shot at making a dent in solving the Drug Crisis.


When it comes to harm reduction, I‚Äôm not opposed to needle exchange and injection sites, the problem is putting that as a priority over rehabilitation and actually getting people off these drugs. And how productive harm reduction is depends immensely on what is done outside of it. If there‚Äôs too much open drug use allowed and not enough pressure being put on dealers, then harm reduction will have no net positive. 

I say hell no on the government making and giving out these drugs. The government can‚Äôt be complicit in handing out hard drugs to junkies. First off the argument that there would be less overdoses because of a guaranteed unlaced quality  product is not a good one  because the vast majority of people who overdose do so on clean drugs, just look at how many people OD on prescription drugs.  These substances are dangerous themselves and should not be used for recreational use. There‚Äôs only going to be more people harmed if you make these substances more available regardless of the quality. And these users are not just going to go these facilities to get high. Again I‚Äôm not opposed to testing and injection sites, but I am opposed to these drugs being supplied by the facilities. Taxpayers are not going to sponsor a zombie program. There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt hand out oxycotin without a prescription to anyone who wants it for fuck sake. 


&gt;Obviously legalize THC, LSD, DMT MDMA and Psilocybin federally. When used responsibly, these drugs are actually proven to be extremely safe. Ain‚Äôt nobody dying from that shit. Regulate them the same way you do Alcohol, Tobacco, Kratom, CBD etc.

I‚Äôm very much interested in the potential for the medical use of psychedelics. I‚Äôve done a good amount of research on the topic and I think these substances will eventually be medically legally but not ever recreationally legal. Psychedelics might not be as dangerous as terrible drugs like cocaine, heroin and meth but using psychedelics is more complex than using weed obviously because these substances cause hallucinations so it‚Äôs just not something medical experts and legislators are going to go for because they don‚Äôt want the use of these substances to be so prominent.",1

El Coronel David Jewett fue sin duda considerado un pirata en
la simple base de que su autoridad como corsario estaba claramente establecida. La autoridad escrita para actuar como corsario
Pues Buenos Aires dijo que pod√≠a perseguir barcos espa√±oles SOLO. No se mencionaban los barcos portugueses.
Jewett fue comisionado como Brevet-Coronel por Buenos Aires, pero luego tom√≥ un trabajo como Privateer en el
Hero√≠na No era un corsario muy exitoso, por lo que se convirti√≥ en pirata, aunque result√≥ no serlo.
muy exitoso en eso tampoco. Mason se hizo cargo de Jewett y demostr√≥ ser tan desafortunado: sirvi√≥ 2 a√±os en
una prisi√≥n portuguesa por delitos cometidos principalmente cuando el Coronel Jewett orden√≥ a la Heroina.
Jewett no ten√≠a √≥rdenes de reclamar las Malvinas. Incluso olvid√≥ mencionar que lo hizo cuando regres√≥ a
Buenos Aires y present√≥ un informe de 13 p√°ginas. Un extra√±o descuido que claramente plantea la pregunta de por qu√©.
El capit√°n Weddell ... ridiculiza todo el proceso; insinuando su creencia, que Jewett simplemente hab√≠a puesto en el
puerto para obtener refrescos para su tripulaci√≥n, y que la asunci√≥n de posesi√≥n era principalmente
destinado a asegurar un reclamo exclusivo sobre el naufragio del barco franc√©s Uranie ... ""
18 a√±os
Por supuesto, Jewett era tan le√≠do como todos los dem√°s en esos d√≠as. Es probable que haya sabido del reclamo brit√°nico,
y la disputa de 1770/71, solo 50 a√±os antes. Quiz√°s es por eso que no inform√≥ su extra√±o reclamo en nombre de
de las Provincias Unidas cuando regres√≥?
Todo muy interesante, pero de nuevo en gran medida irrelevante.
En el siglo XVI, un avistamiento y un nombre parecen haberse considerado lo suficiente como para establecer un reclamo de derecho; en el
Los siglos XVII y XVIII parecen haberse requerido un acuerdo, al menos en primera instancia, pero a principios del siglo XIX.
estos ya no se consideraban suficientes; ni siquiera es que Jewett haya dejado su bandera.
Para la soberan√≠a de 1820 parece haber requerido que una reclamaci√≥n sea seguida r√°pidamente por alguna imposici√≥n de
autoridad. Pero nadie sigui√≥ a Jewett en 1821 o 1822, ni siquiera en 1823. Nadie con autoridad soberana suficiente.
apareci√≥ en Malvinas Este hasta 1829.

tambien es falso que gran breta√±a halla aceptado la posesion argentina de las islas sin ninguna objecion,ya te lo demonstre en mi respuesta anterior, va a ser redumndante que lo vuelva a contestar pero aqui vamos

El gobierno anunci√≥ en la Gaceta oficial el - Comando Pol√≠tico y Militar de las Malvinas.
Tambi√©n le dieron a Luis Vernet el t√≠tulo que ansiaba, aunque por alguna raz√≥n no lo mencionaron.
en la Gaceta
Ahora, Par√≠s sab√≠a que Inglaterra no hab√≠a abandonado su propio reclamo, e inform√≥ sobre las nuevas aspiraciones del
El gobierno de Lavalle a Londres, que lleg√≥ en un momento interesante, ya que las discusiones hab√≠an tenido lugar en m√°s de

Gobierno brit√°nico propone eso mismo. Conoci√≥ a Vernet en m√°s de una ocasi√≥n, compr√≥ tierras

Al escuchar a Parish, el gobierno brit√°nico busc√≥ las opiniones de su departamento legal sobre su reclamo. los
el consejo de los abogados fue que la placa oficial de Clayton hab√≠a preservado todos los derechos de Gran Breta√±a y que Buenos Aries deber√≠a ser
dijo en t√©rminos claros que no se acercara a lo que claramente no les pertenec√≠a.
La parroquia transmiti√≥ ese mensaje en noviembre de 1829.
""El abajo firmante H.B.M. El Encargado de Negocios tiene el honor de informar a S.E. General Guido el Ministro
acusado ante el Departamento de Asuntos Exteriores de que ha comunicado a su corte el funcionario
documento firmado por el General Rodr√≠guez y Don Salvador Mar√≠a del Carril, a nombre del
Gobierno de Buenos Aires, y publicado el 10 de junio pasado, que contiene ciertas disposiciones para
El Gobierno de las Islas Malvinas.
El abajo firmante ha recibido las √≥rdenes de su corte de representar a S.E. General Guido que al emitir
este decreto, se ha asumido que una autoridad es incompatible con los derechos de Su Majestad Brit√°nica de
soberan√≠a sobre las Islas Malvinas.
Estos derechos, fundados en el descubrimiento original y la posterior ocupaci√≥n de dichas islas,
adquiri√≥ una sanci√≥n adicional de la restauraci√≥n, por Su Majestad Cat√≥lica, de los brit√°nicos

fuerza, y qu√© acto de violencia hab√≠a llevado a una discusi√≥n muy enojada entre los gobiernos de los dos
pa√≠ses.
La retirada de las fuerzas de Su Majestad de estas islas, en el a√±o 1774, no puede considerarse como
invalidar los justos derechos de Su Majestad. Esa medida tuvo lugar en cumplimiento de un sistema de
reducci√≥n de personal, adoptada en ese momento por el Gobierno de Su Majestad Brit√°nica. Pero las marcas y se√±ales
de posesi√≥n y propiedad quedaron en las islas. Cuando el gobernador parti√≥, el

propiedad, as√≠ como la intenci√≥n de reanudar la ocupaci√≥n de ese territorio, en un lugar m√°s conveniente
temporada.
El abajo firmante, por lo tanto, en ejecuci√≥n de las Instrucciones de su Corte, protesta formalmente, en nombre
de Su Majestad Brit√°nica, contra las pretensiones establecidas por parte de la Rep√∫blica Argentina, en el
Decreto de 10 de junio, mencionado anteriormente, y contra todos los actos que se hayan realizado o puedan hacerse en adelante,
en perjuicio de los justos derechos de soberan√≠a que hasta ahora han sido ejercidos por la Corona de

Inainte de a intra in detaii pro sau contra o sa enumar cateva idei folositoare, la care eu la varsta de abia 23 de ani impliniti (atunci) nu m-am gandit. 

\- incearca sa citesti sau sa te documentezi cat mai bine despre orasul/zona unde vrei sa te muti sau dc nu tara.

\- limba este un aspect important. Gandeste-te asa, noi ca romani, invatam tot (teoretic) despre toti, le invatam limba, cultura, istoria etc. Ei nu fac chestia asta, sau prea putin; mai ales cand vine vorba de tarile de Est din Europa. Cateva fraze sau notiuni de baza ar fi bine de dezvoltat.

\- incearca sa cauti informatii despre sistemul de sanatate si in general informatii despre protectia muncii etc

\- intotdeauna e mai bine sa ai ceva mai multi bani cu tine, nu uita majoritatea chiriilor cer garantie + 1 luna sau chiar 1 luna si jumatate ca si avans. 

**PROS:** 

\- Scotia ca si tara e minunata insa Scotia NU este = Anglia. (am facut greseala asta si am invatat repede cum sta treaba) , Scottish Highlands este un plus, nu este o tara deloc mare, infrastructura e ok-ish. Am vizitat aproximativ 50% din Scotia si pot spune ca ma simt uneori ""acasa"".

\- oriunde mergi in Scotia poti sa stai cu , cortul atata timp cat nu lasi mizerie in urma, si nu deranjezi practic mediul inconjurator. Adica in sensul ca daca mergi pe dealuri etc, este in regula sa iti pui cortul. Chiar si daca este proprietatea lui X. Daca nu ai marcaje speciale ce spun ca este proprietate privata e ok. Scotia este printre singurele tari ce au o lege numita ""The Free Movement Act"". 

\- infrastructura pare destul de bine conectata , autobuze si trenuri. (amuzant este ca scotienii nu vad lucrurile la fel)

\- ai la dispozitie un sistem medical gratis, daca te inregistrezi la GP, un fel de medic de familie unde tratamentele si medicamentele sunt foarte mult reduse sau pe gratis, insa atentie si aici dai de doctori incompetenti. 

\- cultura si viata sociala sunt aspecte importante: cinematografe, concerte, galerii de arta, muzeele (sunt gratis in UK deoarece sunt in patrimoniul reginei, si asta inseamna ca noi prin taxe platim cum ar veni intrarea - doar la muzee); tot felul de evenimente pe weekend pentru toate varstele, strangerea de fonduri pentru caritate este o activitate importanta, si poti sa te oferi voluntar. 

\- in domeniul serviciilor sunt foarte amabili, la magazine ti se zambeste, ti se vorbeste frumos si intotdeauna incearca sa fie respectuosi; in trenuri controlorul este respectat si te respecta; la restaurante este la fel, chelnerii iti zambesc si incearca sa fie cat mai amabili si nu se asteapta intotdeauna la un bacsisi. Baruri cate vrei , pe cluburi stau mai putin insa depinde , sunt de toate pentru toti. BTW au si ei cocalarii lor. 

\- politia mi se pare mult mai bine organizata, incearca sa ajute unde pot si cat pot, si folosesc foarte rar violenta (uneori pro, uneori contra, depinde din ce perspectiva o iei) - nu poarta arme pe strada de exemplu si ii poti aborda cu usurinta pentru intrebari. Nu au ""aere"" de politsti. 

\- am avut un noroc uluitor si mi-am facut un cerc de prieteni foarte foarte bun. Ma simt ca si cum am familie aici, fetele sunt romance cu parteneri scotieni sau tot din alte tari. Daca nu ar fi fost ele as fi plecat de mult. 

\- ti se largesc orizonturile - Scotia este o tara foarte diversa cu o populatie la fel de diversa; o sa dai nas in nas cu multe culturi toate combinatiile de oameni si idei. Este minunat sa discuti cu oameni din alte tari si sa iti dai seama ca nu sunteti chiar atat de diferiti precum ai crede. Incurajez pe oricine sa se desprinda putin si sa interactioneze cu cei din alte medii. Daca stai tot printre romani, nu faci mare lucru. (reputatia noastra ne urmareste)

\- din nou spun de limba; accentul lor este unul unic si destul de greu de inteles. Accentul scotian mi se pare mult mai frumos decat cel englez (subiectiv). Stiu 2 limbi straine, germana si engleza , eram foarte increzatoare in engleza mea pana cand am venit in Scotia si mi-a luat 1-2 -3 luni (maxim jumatate de an) sa ma obisnuiesc doar cu felul lor de a vorbi. Daca ai un avantaj de limba este mai bine. Am reusit sa gasesc locuri de munca mult mai usor datorita germanei si am castigat un anumit respect pentru asta. 

**CONS:** 

Tot ce o sa spun aici este din experienta mea proprie, deci sunt subiectiva. 

\- Vremea - ploua sau este o vreme mohorata aproape constant. Nu prea e vara ca in Romania, nici macar pe jumatate. Anglia are o clima mai calda si nu este atat de ploioasa. Si pentru asta am suferit foarte mult in primii ani, chiar si acum uneori imi vine sa ma dau de pereti cand efectiv ploua de 2 sapt incontinuu. 

\- foarte putini sunt flexibili sau nu se adapteaza. Daca ai impresia ca o sa te accepte cu bratele deschise, gandeste-te de doua ori. Primul an mi-a fost extrem de greu, deoarece tu esti strainul. 

\- nu sunt calzi ca si oameni - romanii au sange ""latin"", noua ne place sa glumim, sa radem, sa fim mai sociali, scotienii sunt mai seriosi, daca nu le intelegi glumele este foarte usor sa te simti strain; in acelasi timp ei nu sunt interesati sa isi largeasca orizonturile. Foooooarte putini ar considera sa plece vreodata din Scotia, indiferent cat de greu le-ar fi iar daca esti in cautare de un partener, situatie este cam la fel. Scotienii tot la scotience trag pentru ca le inteleg cultura, limba, glumele, impart aceleasi valori (majoritate as spune in proportie de 70%) 

\- este MIZERIE - am fost surprinsa sa observ cat de murdare sunt orasele; oamenilor nu le pasa, arunca tot pe jos, arunca direct din masina, nimeni nu are simtul civic, si nu s-ar apleca dupa un ambalaj nici morti (aici generalizez deoarece sunt implicata in chestia asta iar consiliile nu mai fac fata sa adune tot gunoiul) - mai ales pe weekend cand majoritate sunt beti morti atat barbatii cati si femeile. Este a big culture shock sa zic asa. 

\- salariile in Scotia sunt mult mai mici comparativ cu Anglia, insa traiul de viata este mai acceptabil in Scotia - desi observ in ultimii ani ca parca nu se mai prea merita, deoarece chriile, consumurile, alimentele se scumpesc. 

\- joburile nu sunt atat de multe, depinde ce vrei sa lucrezi, insa nu mi se pare atat de diversa piata lor de munca. 

\- a discuta de bani este considerat tabu. foarte dificile sunt aceste conversatii iar maririle de salar sunt foarte rare. Problema este la ei, pentru ca nu isi cam cer banii.

\- foarte multe droguri, si nu ma refer nici eu la iarba ci la cocaina, heroina, meth si multe altele. In aproape 5 ani am fost martora la doua cazuri de supradozare - este ceva ce iti ramane intiparit in minte - mai ales cand sunt pe strada. 

\- au festul de multi cersetori si oameni fara adapost. 

\- sunt destul de iuti la manie si criminalitatea este destul de ridicata in orasele mai mari; Au anumite zone no-go, adica toti iti spun sa stai departe de ele, mai ales fiind strain. 

\- RELIGIA este in continuare un subiect aprins aici - catolici vs protestanti - celtics vs rangers - au partiile lor de oras. Daca faci greseala sa fii in zona Rangers cu orice obiect vestimentar cu verde pe tine, atunci e momentul oportun sa fii TURIST. 

\- taxele sunt acceptabile insa asigurarile si masinile sunt foarte scump de intretinut. cu toate astea ai nevoie pentru ca este mult mai usor fata de transportul comun; care este foarte scump. Abonamentele de trenuri/ autobuze mi se par destul de scumpe. 

De foarte multe ori ma gandesc sa ma mut altundeva - inca mai sper la Romania, pentru ca imi e foarte draga tara, am familie si prieteni acolo, insa intr-un timp foarte scurt mi s-a schimbat mentalitatea incat Romania nu mai este o optiune atat de buna pentru mine. 

Si ambele liste pot continua on and on and on and on. 

Stiu ca e un comentariu lung si sper sa ajute pe cineva.",1

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself.

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

But it was pretty obvious from the get go this wasnt as clear cut as the media made out, the lack of coverage on his autopsy for example, the fetanyl in his system. This footage having to be leaked, months after the fact because its still being withheld because it leads the wrong narrative is a disgusting indictment of politics playing roughshod with peoples lives.

Its like the Rayshard brooks death that happened in the week after Floyds death, it was very clearly a justified use of force but the politics of the situation led to the officers being charged. The footage was released from the car camera and the wendys and it entirely clears them for having to shoot him.

Now you could campaign for actual change to justice reform, whether its the 3 strike rule not including very minor offenses. Likewise with probation, given how hard life can be for paroles. Minor violations maybe shouldnt be an instant straight back in Jail. Even with that said, i imagine people have a very different idea of what minor is in relation to sleeping in the middle of a drive through, and drunk driving.",1

The HCME determined that George Floyd died of a heart attack induced at least in part by resisting law enforcement subduing him.

They determined that:

* George Floyd bore no indicators of asphyxiation whatsoever, and all the signs that would be present in an asphyxiation case were not present. He was examined for petechial hemorrhaging and occult tissue trauma or bruising and none was found. This indicates he did not asphyxiate, as is obvious because on the video he can be seen moving his head and talking while restrained.

* George Floyd had no life threatening trauma or injury of any kind of his body.

* He had extraordinarily severe end-stage heart disease that could result in immediate death upon any exertion.

* He had a 90% blocked left coronal artery and 70% blocked right (30% is mild, 50% is moderate and merits operation, 70% is severe and needs an immediate bypass, 90% is rarely seen in someone *still alive*).

* He had 0.45:1.2mm left ventricular hypertrophy, extremely severe heart wall damage (normal is 0.5:0.5).

* He had a 560g heart, almost absurdly oversized (normal male is 300g, max unsafe range for an adult male his height/weight is 510g)

* He had a history of severe hypertension and sickle cell anemia.

* He had 11 ng/ml of fentnyl active in his system, enough to fully anesthetize someone. Well above the lethal range in cases of polysubstance abuse and comorbidities for overdose deaths.

* He was polysubstance abusing, with meth, THC, caffeine and tobacco all in his system.

* And on the video, George Floyd repeatedly says ""I can't breathe"" before he's being restrained. He was clearly exhibiting signs of a heart attack prior to anyone kneeling on him.

Allow me to state the obvious: George Floyd did not die because someone kneeled on his neck. He died because he ate too many pork chops throughout his life, took a lethal cocktail of drugs and then overexerted himself when his heart wasn't healthy enough to walk down a street.",1

#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

Ugh.  More of this phrasing that tries to equate it with real emergencies and illnesses.  Getting in a car accident and bleeding out is an *emergency*.  Having a ruptured appendix and needing immediate surgery is an *emergency*.  Wanting to go out and get high is *not* an emergency.

I'm all for legalization of recreational drugs, and a safe supply.  I just don't think it should be done on the taxpayer dime.  What's next- free alcohol for people who want to get drunk?

&gt;  
&gt;Why was he being arrested? 

He admitted to using fake money, drove while intoxicated on meth and fetanyl, was literally trying to drive again, and then he resisted arrests. That's at least 4 charges alone, which meant he'd be going back to jail for a long ass time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why did that cop pull a gun automatically? 

Maybe because traffic stops are one of the most dangerous types of stops and Floyd was a career criminal with a violent past who was also larger than the officers who at the time didn't have any backup or cover. As soon as he started cooperating, which he didn't do to begin with, thus the fucking gun, the cops put the weapons away. 

It's almost like that's how it all works. Cooperate, no gun. Don't cooperate, you get the knee.  


&gt;What kind of country do you live in where that is acceptable?

Tussen vast en vloeibaar zitten vormverschillen. Maar er zijn ook vormverschillen per merk. Ik meen dat Jumbo een vaste ibuprofen heeft die roze, rond en vrij plat is. Soort omvangrijke M&amp;M. En de vaste varianten kun je doormidden breken of snijden. 

Wij hadden in het verleden een Britse specialiteitenwinkel met Schotse eigenaar in de buurt. Die wilde ook best dingen op verzoek meenemen als je beloofde het af te nemen, omdat ze de spullen zelf gingen halen daar. Misschien is dat een optie. Ze hadden bijvoorbeeld ook standaard Lemsip waar de Britten bij een verkoudheid graag aan lurken. En misschien hebben ze bij andere specialiteitenwinkels nog wel beter spul, zoals de Poolse. 

Onze huisarts doet op dit moment nog altijd aan telefonische screening. Ik had een acute en ernstige polsontsteking waar paracetamol, ibuprofen en zelfs Oxycodon niet bij hielp. Hij schreef zonder problemen Diclofenac voor op basis van de ernst van de klachten. Stukje kleiner en effectief voor zowel pijn als ontsteking in mijn geval. Eventueel met een maagbeschermer en anders na het eten innemen. Ondertussen heb ik ze moeten verstoppen voor mijn vriendin die ze wegwerkt als snoepjes omdat ze beter werken dan ibuprofen.

**Here‚Äôs some for the Story/Lore (Some from the books as well, which as of now are considered canon)**

- (Damnation) 47 had a girlfriend that he ended up killing in the end. 47 didn‚Äôt lose his virginity even though he had the chance lmao

- (Enemy Within) 47 gave Diana the middle finger after she made fun of him. He was doing something on a computer (if I‚Äôm remembering correctly) while standing next to a couple uh participating in the act of intercourse. While 47 was trying to normally talk to her, Diana would be making comments on what was happening in his background which annoyed 47. 

- In Damnation, 47 suffered from severe anxiety in which he would see a faceless, black figure named ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù. He took a drug that the book had three names for: Oxycodon, OxyContin, Oxycodone

- He got this anxiety from falling off a cliff in the Himalayas after Diana had to leave because she was compromised. 

- (Damnation) He was buried alive in cement and managed to get out by remembering the frozen lake memory (Refer to last bullet point of section Memories that could be true). He came out looking like what he described as a big gray thing.

**Real memories of the Institute:** (Comic)

- 6 and 47 had, what I would like to call, an Obi-Wan and Anakin dynamic. 6 would want to like to negotiate or peacefully threaten someone, while 47 wanted to kill everyone and just get to the point. 

- Well known fact at this point, but 47 states that 6 and him aren‚Äôt actually brothers.

- 47 would go on to have multiple rabbits that he would set free and tell them to have a million babies. His words, not mine.

- After 47 sacrifices himself to save 6, Ort-Meyer cuts off all of this emotions (that he previously had apparently) and makes him forget everything replacing them with the **false memories of the Institute**

**False memories of the Institute:** (Enemy Within)

- 47 also had a pet mouse that was killed. The other subjects, including 6, killed it as a sick prank. 

- Subject 6 called 47 ‚Äúhis little bitch‚Äù.

- In the Institute, they had an arena where subjects would fight each other. It was entertainment for Ort-Meyer and his rich friends. 47 was always put against 6 (for some reason) and he would always beat the crap out of 47.

- At age 12, 47 kills 6 (while he was using the bathroom at 3 AM) with makeshift fiberwire while he was in the middle of doing his business. Poor boy. 47 looks in the mirror with the deceased 6 and sees how similar they look. 

**Memories that could be true:** (Enemy Within and Damnation)

- The Institute had a headmaster named Laslow

- The pet rat I mean mouse -- Not killed by 6

- The arena -- Not beat up by 6

- Ort-Meyer had an experiment where he forced his subjects into a frozen lake. They had to swim across and find the hole at the end. 47 almost drowned.

**Theories (Only one that is relevant):**

- In the Homecoming cutscene, the reason why 47 doesn‚Äôt beat the crap out of Lucas Grey when he finds out he‚Äôs his childhood bully, 6, is probably because of their scars. Ort-Meyer most likely didn‚Äôt know about it or he didn‚Äôt know the connection it had with 6 so he didn‚Äôt think to cover it up. The latter doesn‚Äôt make as much sense because you would think he would notice that they are the exact same cut. However, he probably didn‚Äôt pay very close attention to 6, because he‚Äôs not his the finest out of all his boys. So 47 had a random nice memory of 6 who was supposedly his ruthless bully.",2

805,2020-08-01 12:57:10+00:00,"As a person who has 22 years of sobriety that line is very hard to pin point. I think it's up to the individual. If I have to have surgery I will allow narcotics while I'm in-patient but not released with them. I was released with them once... It was weird, I had surgery several years ago and the surgeon knew I had an issue in the past and released me with Oxycotin and Dilaudid. I almost lost my mind. I was in pain but it was almost too much psychologically. I was at my parents (they were taking care of me) and I kept the pill bottles on the counter in the kitchen and then kept a note pad of what I took, what time and my pain rating. It kept me accountable and also let me really think about what I was doing rather than just popping a pill. It made me really uncomfortable though. 

Back to RHoNY, although Brandi and Kim may have a lot in common, they are probably not good for one another. I don't know if Kim is sober, I kinda doubt it. I'm not sure if she has issues due to her past drug abuse. Brandi is still active in her disease. As an addict in recovery you avoid people like that socially like the COVID. Brandi is a sloppy, loud mouth and crass drunk. When a person is sober they don't want to even be associated with someone like that. Especially with Kim's public embarrassment being on TV known/accused as an addict. When you're sober you want to be restored to being trustworthy, respected and show others you have grown and evolved. I don't see that authentically from Kim. I see her appeasing Kyle and her family to have them keep helping her financially. She keeps her two lives separated as best she can....for now. Like they say, it's a cunning disease.",1
806,2020-08-01 11:29:04+00:00,"I‚Äôm going to be blatantly honest with you. I had the nuss procedure when I was 15 and for me it was not worth it. Mine was 100% cosmetic and let me tell you the pain was unfucking real and didn‚Äôt start to get better for about a month and then it took about another 6 months before I was comfortable in my own body again. My chest does not hurt anymore and hasn‚Äôt for awhile sometimes I shift weird and my chest feels clunky but it doesn‚Äôt hurt. Sneezing is extremely uncomfortable it feels like my lungs get restricted due to the bars being in there. 

Here‚Äôs why the surgery wasn‚Äôt worth it for me. Atleast not yet 

I got addicted to the pain meds and once they ran out I was forced to cold turkey after being on 2 10mg oxycotins a day for 2 weeks and and 5mg oxycodones every 4 hours as needed for 4 weeks the doctors gave me 7 extra oxycotins and 40 EXTRA OXYCODONES. Once the pain went away and I tried the get off the meds I couldn‚Äôt something inside of me impulsively would take them without even thinking when the meds ran out I started withdrawing hard, insomnia,cold sweats,tremors,vomiting, loss of appetite and it was really hard mentally. I went to the surgeon and he told me 2 weeks max for the withdraws to go away. That was absolute bullshit my withdraws subsided after 3 months and even after that I struggled with insomnia for almost a year and too this day if I get upset enough the first thing that pops into my head is god damn an oxy would make me feel so much better right now. I‚Äôve also developed chronic stomach pain over the past year my stomach just hurts constantly it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs an empty pit directly in the center of my abdomen that‚Äôs cramping/eating itself I‚Äôve been to 2 different gastrointestinal doctors and after 6 months of testing the first one told me and I quote ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt really sure what‚Äôs going on come back in a few months and you might feel better‚Äù my other one diagnosed me with a functional gastrointestinal disorder basically meaning my stomach works they know the pains real they just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing it. It‚Äôs basically a diagnosis to get me to go away. I‚Äôve brought my stomach problems up to the surgeon who put my bars in and he said it very well could be a reaction to the bars but there‚Äôs no way to find out until I get them out in December.

Depending on how old you are your pectus may cause problems later in life and it may be in your best interest to get it done young because your body is still growing so it can adapt to the change with the bars a lot easier than you could if you were older (although I have no idea how old you are). If it‚Äôs purely cosmetic that‚Äôs really a choice you‚Äôre going to have to make. If you don‚Äôt like the way it looks there are ways to fix it and everyone is going to have a different experience with this. I am outstanded with the results my chest is nearly perfect I don‚Äôt think you could ever tell I had pectus if you didn‚Äôt see my scars. I regret the surgery because it‚Äôs just caused me a lot more issues than I thought was going too and this happening while being a teenager and going through highschool just made it 10x worse. But I can comfortably walk around without a shirt on and not feel embarrassed I used to by instinct cross my arms over my chest so you couldn‚Äôt see it. I‚Äôm sure as I get older and once I get the bars out I‚Äôll have a lot more appreciation for my decision.",1

 Bolsonaro visitou Bag√© para inaugurar uma escola do Programa Nacional das Escolas C√≠vico-Militares (Pecim). Na escola S√£o Pedro, de ensino fundamental, o presidente escutou um poema declamado por uma prenda, como s√£o chamadas as mulheres no movimento tradicionalista. Depois, um gaiteiro se apresentou improvisando rimas em homenagem ao presidente.

 Acompanhado dos ministros Rog√©rio Marinho (Desenvolvimento Regional) e Augusto Heleno (Gabinete de Seguran√ßa Institucional), Bolsonaro almo√ßou com militares no 3¬∫ Regimento de Cavalaria Mecanizado.

 Depois do almo√ßo, fechado para a imprensa, o presidente fez a entrega simb√≥lica de 1.164 resid√™ncias do programa Minha Casa Minha Vida. Os conjuntos habitacionais receberam R$ 87,3 milh√µes em investimentos federais.
