Tu ta ligado que o cinema vai morrer ne?culpa desta merda desses filminhos de super heroi. Cinema n é pra divertir, é pra te fazer pensar. Claro q alguns filmes alem de terem criticas sociais são divertidos, como o excelente clube da luta (david fincher, 1999), unanimememnte considerado uma das obras primas do cinema, mas filmes que não passam de lixo escapista, como blockbusters, star wars, marvel, dc, animações nem contam como cinema, porque por DEFINIÇÃO (nem vem discordar, porque essa é a definição de cinema de acordo com os maiores especialistas) deve te fazer sair do filme PENSANDO, e não empolgadinho que nem uma criança. Cinema é arte, não entretenimento. Por isso eu boicoto esse tipo de """"filme"""". É estranho pensar que o mesmo antro artistico que produziu Eraserhead (david lynch, 1977) e laranja mecanica (stanley kubrick, 1971) hoje produz lixos como Endgame. Não assisti e nem assistirei. Me deprime pensar que o pensamento cinematografico de alguem que eu admirava tanto quanto você está reduzido ao nível de um normie subempregado que vê filminho de herói. Tchau.",1

We saw people shooting herioin and smoking crack, was solicited for sex a few times. We were walking up to an alley way and a homeless lady jumped out of the alley and pepper sprayed us for no reason and ran off. As we were rubbing our eyes in pain a guy in a plumbing van stopped and asked us what happened? We told him a lady pepper sprayed us for no reason, he said ""Yup, that happens around here"" and just drove off.  On the plus side, we did manage to score some pretty legit weed above the Amsterdam cafe. At the show a random Canadian asked me if I would like to hit his joint, I obliged and it turned out to be PCP, which was the first time I had smoked  PCP so that was crazy.

Maybe do it on the basis of MBTI or based on common interests etc. Emotions fade away and while everyone experiences strong emotions in the beginning of a relationship, they are more pronounced for people afflicted with BPD. These emotions fade away for everyone eventually, but other people develop a strong bond in due course. Since BPD people are driven by emotions, they incorrectly infer that they have fallen out of love when they don't get the love chemical anymore in their head anymore. A BPD is like an addict, addicted to the oxycotin released when they fall in a new relationship. Since they amygdala's are literally small and overactive, they feel more of a rush than anybody else.",1

What would happen if belgium legalised it? You would have shitloads of drug tourists coming from france. With kids selling all possible drugs to those tourists in every major city. People don't tend to grow their own as much when you can simply get it in a coffeeshop also. And it's also not the same stuff. Look what Nederwiet has become. It's so strong it's considered hard drugs. You can use it as a substitute for oxycodon. That is not normal and not healthy. That kind of shit should be on medical prescription only. It has all kind of side effects...   
And also, in France as in Netherlands, while both are at opposite sides of the law, it's all a very shady and criminal business, ran by mobsters.

15,2019-04-30 00:01:57+00:00," O ex-piloto francês Alain Prost, 64, afirmou em entrevista à agência de notícias AFP que até hoje sua vida está ligada a [Ayrton Senna.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2014/05/1447793-confira-uma-selecao-de-frases-de-ayrton-senna.shtml)

 ""Não há um momento sequer em que, se alguém fala em Prost, não mencione Senna, e vice-versa. Não apenas minha carreira, [mas também minha vida está ligada a ele.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1994/5/03/esporte/26.html) Vivo com ele há uns 30 anos"", disse Prost.

 [A morte do brasileiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2014/04/1447753-dez-perguntas-e-respostas-sobre-a-morte-de-ayrton-senna.shtml), vítima de acidente no GP de San Marino, em Ímola, em 1994, completa 25 anos na quarta-feira (1º).

 Tetracampeão da F-1 (1985, 1986, 1989 e 1993), [Prost foi companheiro de equipe e rival de Senna](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/10/ha-30-anos-senna-conquistava-1o-titulo-e-status-de-heroi-com-vitoria-epica.shtml), tricampeão da categoria (1988, 1990 e 1991).

      

 **Sua rivalidade com Ayrton Senna marcou a história da F-1, talvez mais que qualquer outra. Como você explica isso?** São coisas que podemos explicar, mas não completamente. Não se passa um único dia sem que se fale disso. Alguma coisa sai praticamente todos os dias nas redes sociais, é espantoso. Deixamos uma impressão profunda, mas não nos demos conta disso completamente no passado. Resumindo: passamos de um mundo de especialistas da F-1 a um mundo totalmente aberto.

 Vimos todos os grandes meios de comunicação se interessarem porque havia essa batalha humana entre dois pilotos de carisma, cultura e educação diferentes. Essa rivalidade foi incrível, mas também era ligada a todo o cenário da F-1 e, lamentavelmente, a morte de Ayrton a deixou congelada no tempo.

 Na realidade, eu só corri dois anos com ele na mesma equipe e apenas quatro ou cinco anos ao todo (ambos disputando o mesmo título). Fiz muitas coisas, ganhei muitas corridas e campeonatos sem ele, mas nossa história está totalmente ligada. Não há um momento sequer em que, se alguém fala em Prost, não mencione Senna, e vice-versa. Não apenas minha carreira, mas também minha vida está ligada a ele. Vivo com ele há uns 30 anos.

 **Como se convive com o peso dessa história?** Quando corríamos um contra o outro, mais ou menos 50% das pessoas me adoravam e 50% me odiavam, era realmente incrível. Depois de eu me aposentar, em 1993, as coisas mudaram. Por sorte houve quase seis meses de amizade entre nós desde o momento em que me aposentei da F-1 até o acidente. Isso mudou nossa relação completamente.

 E depois da morte de Ayrton, eu diria que os seguidores dele, não todos, é claro, porque sempre há os que são irredutíveis, mas a grande maioria se uniu em uma história comum, não em torno de Prost contra Senna. E isso é bonito. Por isso eu também tive muita sorte de ter vivido isso dessa maneira.

 Há alguns casos de rancor, de pessoas que assistiram ao filme ([o documentário “Senna”, do britânico Asif Kapadia, de 2010](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2014/04/1447394-produtor-do-filme-senna-foca-mais-na-vida-do-que-na-morte.shtml)), que é um disparate, é uma pena, mas o resto é fabuloso. Quando vou ao Brasil, talvez eu seja mais conhecido até que na França e há um entusiasmo incrível, porque há uma coisa que se converteu em respeito, já que faço parte da Fundação Senna e sempre estive muito próximo da família.

 **De que maneira o acidente fatal de Senna no Grande Prêmio de San Marino, em Ímola, mudou a F-1?** Há um antes e um depois. Em matéria de segurança, já havia sido dado um pequeno passo à frente, mas é duro dizê-lo, porque houve o acidente fatal de Roland Ratzenberger no sábado e outro acidente de Rubens Barrichello na sexta-feira. Sem o acidente de Ayrton no domingo não teria havido grandes mudanças. O acidente de Ayrton colocou tudo de pernas para o ar em matéria de segurança, pelo bem dos pilotos.",1
16,2019-04-29 23:40:20+00:00,"One factor that seems to be often ignored when these discussion comes up is while that is true for regular fentanyl some of the fent analogs are 100-1000 times more potent.

And when dealing with fentantyl products being shipped/sold it's not like you'll have a good idea of what exactly it is until it is tested in a lab. 

Anyways I wouldn't be surprised if cops were exaggerating but people seem to also underestimate how dangerous some fentanyl analogs are. There are definite cases of them making police officers and dogs sick.

The most ironic thing is that fentanyl analogs only exist thanks to the drug war that cops perpetuate, so it's hard to feel sorry for them.",31

I do agree that we need people who go against mainstream thinking, but not in the area of proven science. Vaccines are quite different from medication. A different outlook on Adderal can be helpful, especially a wary one. Medications are variable things, what it does to one person might be different from what it does to another. I don't think you should ever put any pill in your body without talking to your doctor. I take medication and though I haven't seen any harsh side effects I have experienced different results in different drugs. Corporations can't be trusted, the only difference between Adderal and Alcohol is how it fucks you up. Oxycotin, an opiate, was marketed as being safe. And the makers only got 600 million in fines, probably as much as they make in a day.",1

19,2019-04-29 19:10:00+00:00,"Wow... I started using benzodiazepines at 17 years old and became very addicted to them. Started out just doing a couple and went to 
44+ mgs per day... It was nothing to me and actually speeded me up took my nerve pain away from my Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia. 10 years down the road I was actually prescribed Alprazolam 1mg 4 times per day, along with Loratab 10/500 4 time per day, as well as Tramadol 100mgs 4 times per day for in between pain, and let’s not forget 180ml bottle of codeine cough syrup (2 bottles per month). By this age I had been prescribed the Alprazolam and Loratab since the age of 19. At 27 I was taking so much benzodiazepines to the point a script would last me a day and a half- two days tops and then I was forced to buy off the street. It’s not always 100% guaranteed you are going to find them to satisfy you addiction and unfortunately I went almost two weeks without any. One evening I was out with a friend when I had my first full blown seizure. Bruised and busted up my whole left side of my body and had hit my head and suffered from a concussion with two big knots. After that I still didn’t learn my lesson and continued to misuse these medications for years to come where I became addicted to OxyCotin 80mgs and still lioved taking my benzodiazepines just as much. I was up to sometimes six 80mg pills a day   
And drove a vehicle went to work like it was nothing when the withdrawals hit me I wanted to die. My boyfriend and I have gone through so much money spending it on pills buying them off the streets. Today, I still have my seizures from time to time I am 37 now and I have thankfully became sober on my own and so has my boyfriend. Sobriety is very hard at times there are days I wish I was high as hell and just don’t even want to face reality. I want to become numb to anything bad that happens, but I have chosen to stay clean and so has he. I am very thankful that I don’t use pills anymore and have gotten away from being so dependent on benzodiazepines after 20 years of misuse. I hope you can do the same I would hate to know a person would go through some of the things I’ve gone through that I haven’t even mentioned... life is very special I have 11 wonderful and beautiful nieces and nephews that if it wasn’t for them idk know who-what-or where I would be right now and a loving boyfriend who gives me strength and encouragement to stay sober as well as I do for him!",1

 “Vingadores: Ultimato” de fato [encerra um ciclo com os heróis da ](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/cinema-e-series/2019/04/apos-vingadores-marvel-fara-serie-sobre-romance-entre-visao-e-feiticeira-escarlate.shtml)[Marvel](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/cinema-e-series/2019/04/apos-vingadores-marvel-fara-serie-sobre-romance-entre-visao-e-feiticeira-escarlate.shtml), que começou em 2008 e chegou a 22 filmes —só 2009 não teve um título do que ficou conhecido como Universo Cinemático Marvel.

 Ao olhar para trás e ver a ordem dos lançamentos, com os heróis ganhando filmes individuais antes do crossover da saga “Vingadores”, parece fácil observar a galinha de ovos de ouro nas mãos da Marvel, que criou um estúdio próprio justamente com o UCM como projeto inicial. Não foi bem assim.

 Para começar, ao contrário da DC Comics, que sempre se garantiu nos cinemas com seus personagens principais (Batman e Super-Homem), a Marvel não tinha inicialmente os direitos justamente do seu herói mais querido, [Homem-Aranha](https://guia.folha.uol.com.br/cinema/2019/01/novo-longa-do-homem-aranha-e-a-melhor-animacao-de-heroi-ja-lancada.shtml), que teve uma trilogia bem-sucedida lançada pela Sony.

 Mas ao nomear o geek Kevin Feige, à época apenas com 33 anos, como chefe de estúdio, a Marvel apostou no plano do jovem executivo. Sem Homem-Aranha ou X-Men, a ideia era jogar todas as fichas no grupo chave de heróis reunidos em [Vingadores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/04/vingadores-nao-e-o-cidadao-kane-do-genero-nem-uma-tremenda-chatice.shtml).

 Na ordem dos lançamentos, descobriram uma estrela também não óbvia. Poucos colocariam a mão no fogo por Robert Downey Jr., ator de talento, mas passado complicado, que, a partir do momento em que vestiu a armadura do Homem de Ferro, tornou-se um dos mais queridos do público e, consequentemente, um dos mais bem pagos em Hollywood.

 O sucesso do primeiro “Homem de Ferro”, em 2008 — com US$ 318,4 milhões arrecadados só nos cinemas americanos—, e do segundo, em 2010 —mais US$ 312,4 milhões—, foi fundamental para segurar as pontas até a chegada do primeiro “Vingadores”. Talvez se Capitão América, Thor ou Hulk (todos abaixo dos US$ 200 milhões) chegassem antes, a Marvel não teria fôlego para avançar no UCM. Lembrando que nesta primeira fase a Disney ainda não estava lá.

 Cada filme lançado, de certa forma, servia como material de marketing para a chegada de um novo longa dos “Vingadores” nas telas, que estrearam em 2012, 2015 (“A Era de Ultron”) e 2018 (“Guerra Infinita”). Nada como ter um longa de duas horas de duração durante meses em cartaz para atiçar o cinéfilo para o próximo crossover.

 Daí também a estratégia bem-sucedida de colocar pequenas pílulas no fim de cada filme solo de herói, uma espécie de teaser que levava os fãs aos cinemas, mesmo em títulos de heróis menos populares, como “Homem-Formiga” e a própria “Capitã Marvel”, personagens-chave em “Ultimato”. O plano deu tão certo que a Warner/DC repete a tática com sua Liga da Justiça.

 “Vingadores: Ultimato” tem tudo para [ultrapassar os US$ 2 bilhões de bilheteria mundial](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/04/vingadores-ultimato-bate-recorde-em-estreia-nos-eua-e-no-canada.shtml) e se tornar pelo menos a segunda maior arrecadação de todos os tempos —ultrapassar os US$ 2,78 bilhões de [“Avatar” (2009)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u667225.shtml) ainda parece distante, possível, mas distante. Certo é que mesmo que “Vingadores” tenha chegado ao fim do jogo, a Marvel ainda tem muita lenha para queimar.",1

Anywho, one time when i was sleeping ( i use to sleep with the light on) i woke up to my soul being pulled out my body and i was about to float above my bunk bed when I uttered ""Woooah"" and i slammed back down. Afterwards i felt an evil presence and heard ""We have her"". This was after one of my exes broke up with me. The demon was referring to her giving up her christian lifestyle and going astray (which she did lmfao) whats weird though is the way i said ""woah"", i heard it with my head and everything i heard i heard in the middle of my head, not my ears. When i was out of my body, my senses were super strong, it was like i could feel the world. Long story short they tried to make me astral project but something smacked me back into my body.  This was a strange occurrence though cause my spiritual senses were mostly cut off when i was 13-14. Its suppressed for whatever reason, i think maybe for my safety? I use to hear and see them but now i can only sense them and sometimes hear/see them in the middle of my head (not my mind if that makes sense, its weird) but if i take heavy dosages of drugs or a strong one like oxycotin, i can hear them and see shadow figures again.

57,2019-04-26 12:22:15+00:00,"Das Problem in den USA sind meines Erachtens nicht mehr die legal verschriebenen Opioide mehr, da das im letzten Jahrzehnt drastisch zurückgeschraubt wurde, soweit das mittlerweile selbst Terminale Patienten fast keine Chance haben an adequate Schmerzversorgung ranzukommen.

Und wenn man jemanden erstmal abhängig gemacht hat, durch legale Opioide, und dann von einem Tag auf den anderen die Verschreibung verweigert, wird bei der völlig mangelhaften Gesundheitsversorgung in den USA halt nur die Wahl zwischen kaltem Entzug oder Schwarzmarkt bleiben. Insbesondere wenn tatsächlich noch gesundheitliche Probleme bestehen, bei den Opioide helfen.

  


Und das bedeutet das nunmehr ein perfekter Markt geschaffen wurde für Opioide. Und dank des Wechsels von Heroin auf Fentanyl Derivate, ist der Schmuggel noch um einiges einfacher geworden. Ist halt praktisch wenn du nur 1/100 des bisherigen Volumens über die Grenze bringen musst.

Und dank dieses großen Marktes, ist halt auch die Verfügbarkeit der Drogen riesig. So weit dass jeder Highschool Schüler nen Dealer kennt der ihm ohne zu zögern irgendwelche Opioide vertickt.

Und da man selbst als versicherter Amerikaner kaum die Möglichkeit hat einen stationären Entzug zu machen ohne danach in privat Insolvenz zu gehen, werden die Probleme weiter bestehen.

  


Die Schmerzbehandlung mit Cannabinoide sollte eh sekundär sein. Die Behandlung von Tourettes Syndrom oder Ldopa spät dyskinisien ist halt soviel deutlicher belegt, da die Wirkung sozusagen sofort eintritt, und echt krasse Verbesserungen bringt.

  


  


Und dann zusätzlich die Sache, dass mit Alkohol und Nikotin zwei deutlich stärkere Drogen eh legal sind, und der 'Schaden' durch vollständige Legalisierung als Genussmittel deutlich geringer sein wird, als der wirtschaftliche Schäden durch staatliche Verfolgung von Hanfpflanzen Besitzern.

  


  


In der Schmerztherapie kommt aber zusätzlich noch dazu, dass es eigentlich vollkommen irrelevant ist, was die Evidenz besagt. Da es auf die individuelle Wirkung drauf ankommt. Ist halt schön wenn das WHO Stufenschema auf einen Großteil der Patienten zutrifft, aber weder NSAIDs noch Opioide haben in jedem Patienten die Gleiche Wirkung. Und wenn der Patient selber meint, dass durch den THC oder CBD Konsum der Leidensdruck geringer wird, dann ist das ebenso. Völlig egal ob das Placebo ist, oder bestimmte genetische Veranlagung voraussetzt.

Mal abgesehen davon wird ja nicht direkt von dem Schema abgewichen, sondern nachdem Therapieversuche unternommen wurden. Es wird ja niemand mit chronischen Schmerzen direkt Oxycodon oder Fentanyl verschrieben, genauso werden die wenigsten Ärzte direkt Cannabisblüten aufschreiben.

Da kommt bisher schon ein ordentlicher Leidensweg zusammen, das hat Monate und Jahre Überzeugungsarbeit gekostet bis die zwei Patienten die bisher Cannabisblüten in der Apotheke beziehen wo ich zuletzt bearbeitet habe, endlich die Verordnung bekommen haben.

Und klar hat der junge Patient mit Tourettes sich das vorher halt illegal beschafft. Dem Frührentner mit dem Parkinson waren aber sämtliche Drogen suspekt.",7

77,2019-04-24 21:36:03+00:00,"Look up ""heroin overdose myth"". We've been taught that heroin &amp; opioids are these demon drugs that you're destined to die from if you're addicted or take them. It's just not true. 90% of ""heroin"" overdoses are people mixing them with other central nervous system depressants. It's actually not that easy to overdose on heroin alone. It can be done, but that's not the point.   


The media &amp; people in power always ignore the fact that in most overdose cases, the person had more than 1 central nervous system depressant in their body. Then they just flat out call it a 'heroin overdose'. This is misleading and if the media &amp; those in power really cared, they were educate people on the dangers of mixing heroin with other central nervous system depressants rather than just try to demonize heroin &amp; opiates as a whole. It could save lives.   


I was a heroin/pain pill addict for 12 years. Not once have I ever overdosed. I was given fentany, once and told it was heroin. That was the closest I ever felt to overdosing, but I still didn't. Most likely because I hate the way alcohol &amp; benzos feel, so I never mixed them.   


Think about it, most heroin overdose cases are people who have big tolerances to heroin. Why would doing a little more over your tolerance level suddenly just flat out kill you? If that were the case, opiate niave people would be dropping like flies and they don't.   


Multiple drug induced toxicity is the problem here. Methamphetamine is more dangerous than heroin. It destroys dopamine receptors in the brain which leads to parkinsons symptoms and psychosis. It turns into hydrogen peroxide in the body.   


Heroin &amp; opiates don't cause any brain or organ damage of that nature. They're actually quite safe when used responsibly.   


We live on an age where information and knowledge is right at our fingertips. So if you think I'm lying, just do a quick search for ""heroin overdose myth"" and do your own research.   


Alcohol &amp; cigarettes kill more people a year than opiates. Even people who don't use them (drunk drivers, second hand smoke), so why is there no alcohol &amp; tobacco crisis?

When I say you are getting screwed over, I'm referencing you as part of the collective us, as a concerned citizen which you clearly are.

Maybe I just get more mad at people willfully ruining others lives for a profit compared to people trying to survive and just get by.

Its only two examples but they really encapsulate my core issue:

Take johnson and johnson willfully selling cancer powder to women for 2 or 3 decades. They hid the knowledge on purpose, they should be tried for murder and their company fucking destroyed. Instead the get fines/ slaps on the wrist, and settle with some survivors. Those people are all still dead/dying while they keep all the profits and continue to make millions more.

The company escapes me at this moment, but another broke laws and lied about their new drug, pushing it on the market with blatant lies; making hundreds of millions selling opiods and starting the crisis with oxycotin.

They paid like 150k fines, and then did it all over again.

When you compare this to desperate people gaming a system to survive, or attempt to get a better life its just no contest to me.

Sure, some will abuse it fully that don't need it, but thats no reason to throw out the baby with the bath water. 

Even more so when you consider all the figures we covered. I.e. over half pay taxes, the part that don't aren't  some massive drain and in fact looks to mostly break even when factoring in the taxes they pay on goods,etc

I'm also very interested in your thoughts on my early point about following the laws. If illegals are able to get this assistance, doesn't that mean they are following the laws outside of the original illegal entry? We have many laws that protect them and afford them certain rights, they seem to be obeying to me unless I'm unaware of some massive loopholes/hustle to get welfare as someone here illegally

95,2019-04-23 18:30:20+00:00,"Honestly I've heard my story from so many people back when I was going to NA/AA. It goes like-a dis:

Normal dude, well liked. Helpful, friendly. Inside not the most confident. Enjoys drinking, sometimes blackout drunk. Holds a great job with great pay, has great friends and loving family. Educated. Takes care of himself.

One time at a party a close friend offers a small amount of painkillers. It's whatever, not that good. Weeks go. One time at a party he's not drinking but tries another painkiller. Shit feels ahMAYzing. Life is amazing, but it's a weekend thing only.

One day at work it's a spectacular shitty day. Popping a pill will help. Only this one time. A month later it's a daily habit. But hey, rent is still being paid, gym time is still happening, sexy times are still happening. Hell sexy times are even better somehow because now the ability to cum takes forever so this is cool.

And, whoa, painting is so much more enjoyable on these pills. Everything is still okay, quitting is probably easy. People who can't quit are fucking pussies and idiots. I have no reason to quit though, everything is great!

One day the dealer disappears. The sickness creeps in. The soul is being ripped from the body. Puking from every hole. Tears of rage, screams of sorrow. Am I an addict? I'm so normal. I'm normal.

Dealer comes through after you call out sick 2 days in a row. You go back to work and fucking kill it, sales guy of the millennium. Everything is awesome but some time soon maybe I should look into weaning off this shit.

Dealer disappears again but put a little bug in your ear. Heroin is cheaper. Heroin can be smoked or snorted so you won't really be a junkie. No needles needed! Well then what's the difference between snorting pills and snorting powder? Nothing except heroin is fucking awesome. Pills are for fucking pussing heroin is fucking awesome I'm fucking invincible. Sleepy but invincible. I can do anything, heroin is my meth. 

4 years later everything has changed but its been such a slow change that the new norm is just the norm. You survive. You survive to do heroin. Everything is heroin. Heroin heroin. Heroin. Heroin? Heroin heroin heroin, heroin heroin heroin heroin heroin. Heroin, ""Heroin heroin heroin? Heroin!"" Heroin heroin heroin heroin heroin heroin heroin heroin heroin heroin heroin herio herionnn herio. heroin. heroi. herrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

And then you wake up and you're a fucking ghost. That person you used to be? Are you sure that was you? Doesn't seem possible. Life is meaningless, death seems like such a better option. You're worthless you're fucking scum YOU DESERVE THIS. Society agrees, you're fucking trash you fucking piece of shit just clean yourself up. You gonna live like this your whole life?

Fuck heroin.

I tried to quit cold turkey so many times. I hid it so well but eventually it comes out and everybody was shocked. SHOCKED. Something was off but you made the best excuses. You were on top for so long how could anything else be conceivable? 

I've only been off heroin for 2 years because of Suboxone. On the one hand I can live my life without constantly thinking about a drug.

I'd like to find a way to do this on my own, even if it takes a lot of trial and error. 

Do you have any idea how they control what acetylates? I'm guessing some other chemical when mixed increases the chances for diacetylation instead of monoacetylation.

I was looking for the simplest method. I figure if I heat the opium with the acetic acid, and leave it for a few hours, it would at least form the more liposoluble monoacetyl morphine which isn't as strong as diamorphin but stronger than morphine essentially potentiating the opium

At the end I'd mix some sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the remaining non reacted acetic acid, so it would be safe for consumption... Please tell me this feasibly checks out. I miss the euphoria so much but can't let myself go back to taking shit I can't produce on my own.",1

103,2019-04-23 12:12:27+00:00,"&gt; Eh I think my problem with the anime messages like this I usually I don’t agree with an anime when I find there messages to be heavy handed one -sided sanctimonious messages or too simplistic it also really cliche . 

You don't need to agree with the message to appreciate it.

&gt; Like for me There nothing Romantic about nature (Nature for me is Not Good nor Evil it’s Neutral ) Frankly Nature can be fucking awful brutal with zero remorse for anyone or down right confusing and contradictory . Like having a Complex lovable fluffy social animals like hamsters that regularly eat there own young and Cannibalism is normal .To horrific flesh eating viruses like Eboli and plagues are also natural Not sure what meaning you can get from making shit like eboli but that nature lol. There a lot of things people exclude from the definition of nature because it morally offensive or weird strange and contradictory to some kinda idealized form of nature.

Darlifra is not romantising nature, rather it is about the beauty of the natural cycle in which things are born, and **die**. Death being a essential part of what defines us as a species and in society. The idea is that we've been cheating death (because of economic and medical/technological advances) for so long, that it is fundamentally changing who we are. Do we like what we see in the mirror? Is death really more scary than a meaningless existence?

&gt; First thing if were going by Evolution theory All is say is things adapt and find solution (it's Random there a product of chance ) . They don’t have any particular meaning to them beyond what you personally believe . The actof adaptive and defying nature could be just as meaningful to someone . While the act of living within what that individual consider the ""limits of nature"" is meaningful to them . There both meaningful to someone it just depends on your personal beliefs , what theology systems your raised in

The basic premise of *this* story is that the meaning of life is fundamentally tied to our biological drives. What are the things we love? These things are displayed in the show prominently - Sexual desire, food, desire to belong and to be recognised, safety from threats, etc. All of these are rooted in our biological drives, which depend on the basic foundation of the natural cycle of life and death. Disrupting this mean that we will (and are) disrupting the basic foundations of human society. This is indisputable given the changes in society we have witness in the past decades. The question is what form human society will take against these challenges. Darlifra provides *one* answer, a hypothetical scenario that is based on current trends.

&gt; For Example Human have thumbs we adapted to use tools ,....so gives us the biological advantage to dominate the planet as a technologically using ape, Are complex brain allows us to understand understand something like the immortal jelly fish up there . We naturally modify are environment and use technology , down to making fire . It always been the case . Using Fire was the advance technology of it heyday. It all technology ( Advance or simple is arbitrary , I can describe fire as a complex gaseous mixture , as much as I can describe a computer as a complex set of metal and electrons , ) If we had computers for 5000 years lol we would call it primitive simple technology "" . It's all perception and what you consider Advance basic or simple etc .

&gt; We also take design solution from other animals and adaptive to are own because of are complex intelligence ( when we tried to fly people made mechanical wings ,then we found out about physics and gravity and tried to find ways to adaptive around them ) . . Are ability to defy the limits of are environments is very human quality that no other animal shares with us (Using things other than are hands like making clothes and shelter ) is a product of evolutionary success at using technology calling it advance or simple it still technology . But this is all ""nature "" lol.

Everything you said above is predicated on *natural selection*, which depends on advantageous genes propagating through the population, and in the natural world, is deeply intertwined with sexual reproduction and the cycle of life and death.

&gt; So for me the messages is kinda confusing . because I don't see technology as ""Evil "" or bad "" or unnatural . We are literally product of Evolution . We are technology Using animals . And with this ‘we can defy environments and limits of are physical bodies and the limit of nature . But this was given to us by evolution Lol so I don't see how it can be unnatural . it just different very different from other animals , but it just a one spectrum of possibilities. fact we can imagine a futuristic future or living on another planet with robots and all sort of strange things. but from nature we adapted this ability

It's not rejecting evolution, it's actually saying that we are at the inflection point - we are so technologically advanced that evolution will fail to work, because we no longer need evolution to survive. If we don't die, then there is no natural selection. If there is no natural selection needed, then we don't need sexual reproduction. And so on and so on. We will lose our abilities that were developed to succeed in a evolutionary environment.

&gt; ...

&gt; Honestly that scene with the Old woman The first thing that came to mind is they've got a shitty marriage lol.

The woman was in a loving relationship with her partner before, but their society changed and people no longer need to have physical relationships due to the biological changes of immortality. With a unlimited lifespan, time no longer means the same as it does otherwise. Their society progressed to the point of people mainly spending their time in the pleasure chambers. Why do you need to spend more time with your loved ones when there is 1. no time limit to your life and 2. you can get the same hit of neurotransmitters (oxycotin, endorphines, etc) from a machine wired into your brain?

Also, as the immortality treatment removes the need for sexual reproduction (and desire), the nature of partner relationships also change drastically.

&gt; 
If they don't age figure they would still be having sex .one of the thing that kills a lot of marriage is lose of attraction and sex drive ( you can still have non-reproductive sex lol.. even if your sterile doesn't mean you lack sexual desire &gt;_&gt;)I still don't understand the old woman was old to begin with seem to contradict the show there suppose to be immortal why is she old ? )

A basic understanding of biology and evolution is called for here. Firstly, sex drive declines with age, that couple was very very old. Secondly, the natural selection will eventually weed out unnecessary functions, which is a major part of the story here (although sped up in terms of timescales obviously).

Also, as we pointed out above, sexual reproduction and desire is suppressed by immortality - to the point in which sex itself is considered backwards and taboo. So going back to the previous point, why do you need sex when you can get the pleasures of sex from a machine hooked into your brain?

&gt; I've talked to a lot of friends with really shitty marriages and it pretty common with 50 % divorce rate .If her husband doesn't talk to her anymore they probably had pre-existing problems before he started to going into another world . Like most terrible marriages people marry for many reason that have little to do with love , (Money Family Traditions honor , Land Power Politics . Love and friendship that more of a modern thing )

Try taking a step back and think of the big picture. This is a fictional show that is written to address abstract concepts based on real trends, leading to hypothetical but plausible problems that can very well happen in reality, So they may not happen in 50 years, how about 100? 200? 500?.

&gt; Also .Just because I get a video game doesn't mean I am going to stop talking to people ... particular if I am still into my wife , and ( why are they old That make no sense I thought they stopped aging and are now immortals ? LOL the world building is inconsistent ! Thought the point is now there immortal now that they don't age ? )

You're making again assumptions on your own. There can be many explanations -

1. They were already old when they undergone the immortality treatment
2. The treatment only stops you from ageing medically. Their appearance can still age.
3. The immortality treatment changes people biologically - we already know that sexual reproduction and desire is suppressed.

All-in-all, I think your arguments lack careful thought. Almost everything you've brought up is addressed in one way or another in the show. You can of course disagree with their conclusion on these points, but you seem to be denying that they were even there. The show did a good job in making these points, so if you loved the characters, at least have the respect of considering the message that the show's creators wanted to communicate through them.",1

Either it was straight fent powder or a blend. My main plug would get different bags in small quantities and have me try them to tell him what was what. Fent always comes on hard and fast. And goes away just as fast. A few hours and I needed to dose again. The Chinese shut down exporting fent about a year ago, but never stopped exporting the precursor chemicals. Those get sent to Mexico mainly, where the final product is made by the cartels. 

Regionally (and very basically)  east of the Mississippi is stamps. They can have #4 heroin, fent, or a mixture. Sometimes the gangs in the inner cities will mix in Benzos with the dope for a cheaper mix. I found this out after a blood test I had and Benzos were on the results. West of the Mississippi you have your tar, and #3 heroin aka gunpowder. Not too much experience out west, so how much fentanal is used I'm unsure. 

Also, people have been calling pure fentanal China white these days. Prior to the fent explosion, China white was a from of #4 heroin that was supposedly very pure. Now I think fent is just cashing in on a name.

I feel like you missed the point. talex777 is speaking to chronic pain sufferers who are being denied medication and turning to illegal sources. I'm personally going through life with serious chronic pain with no relief and cannot bring up pain management with a doctor without being told ""you'll be an addict"" and accused of drug seeking. Eventually, where do you think people like myself should go ? What choices are we left with ? There is no humane reason to stop helping releive our actual pain, to the contrary, there is every reason **to** help us with our quality of life.",14

132,2019-04-21 05:38:45+00:00,"&gt;What’s the root of the “gateway drug effect,” from a perspective of a societal concern and from a public health perspective?

The idea that trying one drug will lead to a more diverse spectrum of drugs, or perhaps to markedly more harmful drugs. It originates in the effort to start the formal drug laws in the US and the anti-cannabis movement.

Moving from one opiate to another is switching from a hard drug to a harder drug. Meth and cocaine don't become less serious because they are prescribed and neither do opioids.

Hell fentanyl is prescribed and it's a huge step up from things like heroin.

Appealing to the idea that opiates are different because there is a pharmacological distinction is nonsense. Virtually every strain of weed is perfectly unique in it's blend of cannabinoids and active terpenes and yet it's very obvious that weed in all it's varieties is a single drug, and the same is true of opiates.

Especially if we are considering *the user* and the public health perspective, opiate users don't care about getting heroin, fentayl, opanas or morphine as long as they are getting their fix. It's all the same product at different strengths. 

Moreso, this doesn't hold because the oxycodone is already one of the ""hard"" drugs the gateway effect is supposed to apply to.

You keep trying to describe classic addiction to pharmcuticals and the vicious cycle of addiction as the gateway effect and it's not.

Being prescribed drugs is not the same as trying a recreational substance.

Opiate users do not try one pill and then switch to heroin to see how different it is, they use up whatever they have and switch to heroin *because it's the same thing* only cheaper.

&gt;but if one is progressing from something relatively harmless to something harmful,

Opiates and Opioids are harmful.

Progressing from a prescription opioid to heroin does not represent a material difference. In many cases prescription opiates are much stronger than heroin.

&gt;Hard alcohol” may be a common descriptor but it doesn’t seem to be a useful one when looking at drugs of abuse holistically.

When looking at potential for dangerous abuse the distinction between beer and hard liquor like wine and spirits is quite clear.

It's difficult to get alcohol poisoning from beer. You can do it if you really try, but it's going to take a lot of effort and several cases of beer.

One handle of liquor is enough for most adult humans to die of alcohol poisoning.

When looking at the criteria of ""jump in harm"" alcohol has a larger one between beer and liquor, because as I've already pointed out, changing opiates is a much smaller change in potency.",1

---------|----------|----------|
I’ve fantasized about dropping everything and moving away too, but I’m the most cautious adventurous person you’d ever meet. I feel stuck. I considered moving to DC even if it meant being homeless for a while, or moving to Korea to teach English, but idk if I will ever actually do it.  Did you start off with any kind of savings or did you start from the bottom? Was it difficult getting yourself established?|Well for me, I went off to rehab. From rehab I went to a SLE (Sober Living Environment)  where I could not stay sober for a while. I had absolutely no money to my name at all. There’s a term for alcoholics that are sober but are not actively working on themselves and it’s called “white knuckling” and that’s what I was doing. If I was sober, I was still talking about drugs, or watching drug show tv programs. I eventually was kicked out of 3 SLE’s and was living either with females I had met on the street, or behind a grocery store.  So I was homeless here but not for long, I was busted for shoplifting socks &amp; lunchables from target and that was for some reason all I needed to push me to get sincerely sober again. I found a gf at the time who had lived in California her whole life. Her &amp; I now live in her since passed on, grandfathers house. But to answer your question when I left for rehab I had no money to my name what so ever. I had small assets like a motorcycle and other shit but nothing of any value.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/eldrlk7/)
Huge respect for you bro. How are you doing?|I’m doing better, thank you. Not everything in my life is Perfect but it’s significantly better|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/eldglwm/)
I'm glad that you're doing better! Was it hard to quit fentnyl?|Unbelievably; the withdraws were nothing I was unfamiliar with due to years of heroin abuse, however it was much stronger. The drug specifically was called “u44700” it has a fucking Terrible reputation for killing people almost instantly.  I was vomiting my own stomach lining|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/eldojps/)
Done this twice now (work etc). How did you find the first year in the new location?  Who, if anyone did you keep in touch with, why? Do you feel the same person who left, How do you think you changed? What still needs to change?|I was very homesick the first year. All my friends back home we’re dying left and right. I felt bad for not being present for the funeral of significant good people in my life. I have a few friends back at home I keep in touch with, the number one person I talk to daily is of course is my mother, who is very proud of me.  She has seen me literally dead/ on life support so where I am now is night &amp; day. “Do you feel the same person who left” I absolutely love this question because I ask myself it often.  I am so drastically different from the person I used to be it’s insane. When I was an addict all eyes had to be on me and I had to be the center of attention in the room, now that I’m sober that is not the case at all. My views/hobbies/morals have not changed however the way I present myself, the stuff I talk about, the way I come across, and the way I dress have all changed. However at the end of the day I’m still the same person I was. I still love animals, my mother and all the same stuff I always have. I can work on a lot about myself the first one if how I react in certain situations, when i first was sober I realized I had a lot of flaws I didn’t notice, like being too reactive, or only hearing “I”statements in criticism. I’m working on it now but I can do better|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/eldy6xi/)
Did you get a job first or get a place to live first? What has been the hardest part so far?|Place to live first. Hardest part has been making friends and saving money in the most expensive part of America (Silicon Valley)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/ele0kdu/)
This is truly the most inspiring AMA I’ve seen so far. Congrats on being sober. My question is: Fentanyl? I didn’t even realize people did straight up fentanyl, I always thought people just used it to cut other drugs. So, why was fentanyl your drug of choice?|It was sold out of a drug house. I noticed their dope was super strong. So I only got their dope(if it’s the best, why go elsewhere?) I noticed that when I was withdrawing off their stuff I would do other people’s heroin, and it would do absolutely nothing for me. I’d still be so sick (this is normal for research chemicals/ fentynl because it’s so strong normal heroin doesn’t touch it) i could only do their dope, it was a monopoly on their end|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/elec07w/)
Regardless of your situation, would you say you feel like you have a clean slate moving across the country where you know no one?|Yes and no. Although I can guarantee I will go to the grocery store and see no one I recognize, my record follows me.  If I have a bad day and want to use drugs, it’s going to take me ATLEAST 2+ hours to find it.  So yes I feel like it’s a clean slate however I did not just wake up one day feeling like a different person, if that makes any sense|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/eldy2qu/)
I feel like I was meant to see this. I'm a 25 y.o. Michigander currently visiting family in California and I know I'd be much happier here. Scared to take the plunge but moving here is what I've wanted for a very long time. What do you wish you knew before you moved to California?|I wish I knew about the great health care CA has for basically anyone who is not working. I had hepatitis C. In Michigan, they wanted $30,000 out of pocket to get it cured. in CA I had it cured for free because I was homeless and trying to get my life together. When I had that disease, it constantly made me feel terrible, since it was not going anywhere I used it as an excuse to use drugs. When I was cured I had a reason to live and get clean|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/eleaqtb/)
I don't have any questions at the moment but I just want to say that that's incredible that you chose to turn your life around and I'm really proud of you for that. Keep on keepin' on!|Thank you for your kind words|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/eled5pt/)
Did you ever mix fentanyl with anything else?|Yes mostly cocaine and crack if I felt like speedballing. Crack was not preferred because you would have to mix it with lemon juice (to break down the baking soda) so it REALLY burns your veins. Crack was more often than coke because I was a broke bitch|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/eldyspe/)
Knew absolutely no one? In comments you explain that you moved there with a gf. Which is it?  Congrats on your sobriety.|I met the gf 9 months after living here. I made friends in rehab who lived In California, but I have 0 ties to this state completely|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/bfghvd/i_27mmoved_across_the_country_to_a_state_where_i/ele70fu/)

Pain pills are the same drug as heroin. Opiates are as hard as opiates. It doesn't really matter to your nervous system if its heroin or oxycodon.

-The coach for the cheerleading team was fired for allowing hazing, there is so much stuff that happened, but the worst was that Freshman girls we're made to wrestle in chocolate syrup (in bikini's) while there we're upperclassman watching who we're all drinking and smoking weed

-The dean of students got 2 dui's, but he didn't get fired because he had cancer

So dopamine is about excitement, about Wanting; it works with the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen to create the initial blast of attraction and infatuation. However, the excitement, like any dopamine surge, diminishes with familiarity. What is a couple to do? Ideally, they want to develope a state of Attachment. Of Having, rather than Wanting. A mutual comfort, inter-dependence, satisfaction. Mediated by Oxycotin, not serotonin, sorry. Oxy is released during bonding activities; things that make you feel close.

158,2019-04-19 01:47:14+00:00,"Id have you know I am extremely tolerant to pain. I dont know why, but out of everyone I know, I don't really mind pain that much... But some cases it becomes very apparent when something is intolerable.

Had deviated septum surgery and reconstruction surgery at the same time to use the cartilage from the septum to rebuild my nose (this is after 15 years of reconstruction surgeries with a shitty doctor till I finally went to someone else).

Essentially the deviated septum surgery took 45 mins, while the reconstruction took 4 hrs. Anyway, the septum surgery is essentially just shaving off cartilage on the inside of your nose to fix the deviation and open the airways. You think accidentally scratching the inside of your nose hurts? Imagine taking a rake and ripping out the inside of your nose. Thats pretty much what they do.

After it was all said and done its packed with plastic stints and some kind of fluff.

Now I've been on most accepted pain meds, and usually I dont need them, even after 15 years of surgeries ive only needed them once before for the rhinoplasty (bone was fucked up from the accident when i was 3 and growing out with an overly tight nose tends to cause problems). Im usually totally lucid and functioning on oxycotin, but I woke up in tremendous pain with them saying theyve already given me pain meds via IV.

Requested more hydrocodone on the spot, still in huge pain for the next few days on hydros. 

Come in to take the packing out after two days....



No. Worse pain than the surgery. Having all of the packing removed from deep inside my head like someone was pulling my brain out through my sinuses and blending up the inside of my nose with a drillbit. They then sucked all of the blood out which felt like more brain sucking.

Needless to say we went immediately to get oxycotin because I was already on 2 hydros and that shit still felt like I was going to die.

Pop in oxycotin and bam. I felt **Normal**
No loopyness, just slight uncomfortable in my face which would radiate in ungodly pain whenever I reached time for the next dose.

Never again.




Bonus story:

Crashed my bike going downhill 25km+ /hr right into an invisible curb just jetting out in the darkness (japan has terrible fucking planning when it comes to roads), and I had to plant my foot on the curb to prevent my head from diving straight into the pavement.

Flew 10 feet with my palms then grinding on the pavement for 3 more before I managed to judo roll and prevent any other damage to my body (did judo an parkour a lot in the past thank god.) I know for a fact if I didnt ditch the bike and go for the tumble, I would have died. I was on a road bike with my head down- all of my weight would have gone forward and into the pavement at 25 km/hr

My hads were fucked. Skin melted off, bled on the way home, but I kept pressure so wasnt as bad. Luckily it didnt go to the bone, but the next day, when the shitty japanese doctor decided to start brushing the open wounds under cold water with a **toothbrush!!!!!** I was like ""WTF ARE YOU DOING!?""



Then then decided it was best to numb it first, by sticking a needle into my palms open wounds all over.

Which if you hadnt guesses, the palm is full of fucking nerves, and what this fucker did, was put a needle through every single one of the nerves in my palm to numb it. I wish I had just let him use the toothbrush, because this was probably the worst pain I've ever felt in my life, even worse than the nose surgery. I was literally screaming when he put the needle in.

(If you hadn't noticed, this all happened with a broken foot from planting my foot on the curb. I didnt even mind the pain, and just simply forgot it.)

After the needling was done, it was back to the brushing, which I could then not feel.

Hmm, é o que parece.  


Mas, não sei também... Ontem terminei de assistir Shazam, Eu gostei de modo geral mas, uma crítica que eu faço é o excesso de piadinhas... Tipo, muitas foram boas, mas tinha hora que o timing (pra mim) tava completamente fora, parece que nunca tinha um momento de seriedade no enredo.  


Faço a mesma crítica a *Homem-Formiga e a Vespa* e *Thor:Ragnarok*. No caso desse último pra mim é mais evidente ainda. Os 2 primeiros filmes do Thor não tiveram lá tanta piada, tentaram retratar o heroi do jeito mais sério que ele é, e não fez tanto sucesso. No Ragnarok... nossa... era piada pastelão atrás de piada pastelão, até no meio do combate com o vilão principal.  


  
Será que eu to ficando chato mesmo ou mais alguém partilha do mesmo? A última coisa que eu quero me tornar é um velho que não sabe apreciar novas tendências... o que parece ser o caso.  


Um contraponto. O *Vingadores:Guerra Infinita,* teve lá suas piada mas não teve um excesso pra mim... soube focar nos momentos sérios e dramáticos.  


Talvez em filmes como do Shazam, Thor e Homem-Formiga, por não serem herois carismáticos com ambientação conhecida, eles encham de piadinha pra que todo mundo se divirta... sei lá...",1

As an example outside of pricing, the FDA originally approved oxycodon as a non-addictive drug and it is definitely the FDA’s fault this happened.

perfeito. o problema não foi nada disso, mas dois fenomenos.

o primeiro é a valorização da imagem do juiz. JB foi o primeiro magistrado a ser alçado a heroi. sua imagem foi extremamente valorizada como o Justiceiro. foi a criação do Juiz-Justiceiro que não precisa responder aos ""adversários"" - não por não ser cobrado, mas por se colocar como além deles. Pela primeira vez o STF entrou no holofote. Daí que vem Moro, Bretas, Barroso, O Jardineiro e etc.

o segundo está não no procedimento, mas no mérito. JB subverteu a teoria do dominio do fato para, na pratica, inverter o onus da prova e mitigar a presunção de inocencia.

Example 1: You need treatment but have no money, for example a surgery that costs 30.000 $ and nobody wants to give you a credit. So you need to get that money by all means and after selling everything you don't need you still don't have enough money so you commit crimes to get that money. That doesn't have to mean murder, maybe you steal a pack of noodles so you don't have to pay for them, you steal a purse from somebody or you go the hard way and rob somebody, i mean the gun for that is not the problem.

Example 2: You had a severe illness and because of your debt you land in the underclass or even poverty. Poverty is directly linked to crime because of frustration, social isolation etc. and of course because you need money. And if you have to move to a shitty neighbourhood because yoi cant pay the rent for your old house your kids will experience a violent surrounding and will more likely become criminal.

Example 3: The profit hungry pharma industry, hospitals, doctors etc. prescribed opioids and benzos even if you don't really need them for profit which lead to the opioid epidemic your country is currently experiencing. Your opioid crisis is so severe that life expectancy in the usa decreased since 2017, life expectancy decreased because there were 16 opioid overdoses per 100.000 in the usa in 2017, 64.000 overdose deaths were registered in the USA in 2016! Caused by capitalism in the medical industry. And that a opioid addiction crisis leads to more crime should be obvious. If the doctor doesn't prescribe you fentanyl or oxycodon than your have to get it on the black market, aka drug crime. This increases drug trafficking, illegal drug organizations, more violent dealers, mexican drug cartels etc. And of course the procurement crime of the drug addicts.

As vezes eu acho que é justamente isso que faz com que as pessoas criem visões tão peculiares sobre questões amplamente conhecidas. 

Eu penso que isso é um conjunto de fatores que culminaram na percepção e normalização do absurdo. 

Letrados ou não, nós somos consumidos por um entretenimento de narrativas claras e semelhantes do tipo 'heroi x vilão' ' eles x nós' ' sistema x indivíduo ' 'controle = poder'.

Sejam livros, músicas, filmes, video-games etc. Todas as mídias romantizam uma sociedade alienada/escravizada e que 'o escolhido' desperta/luta para salvar a todos. Sim, também podemos fazer uma leitura religiosa desse trecho.

Agora pra  não me estender muito, pensa em como esse subconsciente bombardeado com esses conceitos permite a possibilidade de se contestar uma coisa cravada na história da humanidade como o conceito da terra ter o formato esférico. Aqui, pode não parecer, mas aflora-e no subconsciente das pessoas que elas viveram uma mentira, e que por algum motivo 'eles' (o sistema) querem que você acredite no que dizem, logo o 'não acreditar' mesmo que aparentemente absurda, torna-se uma possibilidade real de escolha, e uma vez que quando queremos questionar algo, tudo que corroborar para contribuir a nossa visão será absorvido como uma 'luta contra o sistema manipulador', dando-lhes a sensação egóica de que eles sim estão vendo a verdade e que o resto do mundo está preso em sua matrix abraçando uma verdade inventada.

 Moreno, no poder desde 2017, lamentou em entrevista concedida ao jornal britânico The Guardian que o governo anterior tenha oferecido na embaixada equipamentos que permitiram a Assange ""interferir nos assuntos de outros Estados"".

 ""Não podemos permitir em nossa casa, a casa que abriu suas portas, nos tornarmos um centro de espionagem"", declarou Moreno. ""Essa atividade viola as condições de asilo"", acrescentou, assegurando que a decisão de retirar o asilo de Assange ""não é arbitrária, mas se baseia no direito internacional"".

 O presidente equatoriano denunciou também a atitude ""[absolutamente repreensível e escandalosa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/assange-andava-de-skate-na-embaixada-do-equador-e-nao-tomava-banho.shtml)"" de Assange na embaixada e seu ""comportamento inapropriado em matéria de higiene"". Ele teria sujado as paredes com suas fezes, segundo o governo do Equador.

 Entrevistada pela Sky News na manhã deste domingo, a advogada de Assange, Jennifer Robinson, negou essas acusações, que classificou de ""escandalosas"".

 Robson afirmou que o fundador do WikiLeaks está [disposto a cooperar com as autoridades suecas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/assange-esta-disposto-a-cooperar-com-as-autoridades-suecas-diz-advogada.shtml) caso decidam reabrir o processo de estupro contra ele, mas que sua prioridade continua sendo evitar a extradição para os Estados Unidos.

 ""Estamos absolutamente felizes de responder a estas perguntas se e quando forem apresentadas"", declarou Jennifer Robinson ao canal Sky News.

 ""A questão chave no momento é [o pedido de] extradição dos Estados Unidos"", completou.

 Assange foi detido na quinta-feira na Embaixada do Equador em Londres, onde havia obtido asilo há sete anos para escapar de uma ordem de detenção britânica por acusações de estupro e agressão sexual na Suécia, que ele sempre negou.

 A denúncia por agressão sexual prescreveu em 2015. A justiça da Suécia arquivou as acusações no segundo caso em maio de 2017, por falta de condições para avançar na investigação. 

 Mas com o anúncio de sua detenção, a advogada da denunciante pediu a reabertura da investigação.

 O australiano de 47 anos foi detido também devido a um pedido de extradição dos Estados Unidos, onde a justiça o acusa de ter ajudada a ex-analista de inteligência Chelsea Manning a obter uma senha de acesso a milhares de documentos sigilosos.

 Este pedido será analisado pela Justiça britânica em 2 de maio.

 Se a Suécia solicitar sua extradição, ""pediremos as mesmas garantias que já formulamos, que (Assange) não seja enviado aos Estados Unidos"", declarou Robinson.

 A advogada explicou que seu cliente buscou refúgio na Embaixada do Equador ante a falta de tais garantias.

 ### Visita de deputados

 Mais de 70 parlamentares britânicos assinaram uma carta enviada ao Ministério do Interior na qual pedem prioridade a uma possível ordem de extradição sueca.

By now you're used to waking up from your pallet well before the sun to arrive at your ninˈtåh's desert plots just before dawn, lantern in one hand and hopefully a few saviwi (""oily egg"" made of ground pomace and root starch) in your satchel . Unlike the farmers or the poorer tenants closer to the city you don't have the resources for actual farming, so you harvest sand, salt or soil depending on the area.

Here's an [article on Perezscope bashing some of Antiquorum's latest Daytona sales](https://perezcope.com/2018/07/17/vintage-rolex-daytonas-from-hell-at-antiquorum/). Are these 2 Daytonas ultra-rare amazing prototypes or just more Antiquorum horse shit? I'll leave that for you to decide! I was hesitant to even feature these as ""Cool Rolexes"" but hey, I'm 539 days in. :)



I used to feel a little bad bashing Antiquorum because their auction history is a very vast and useful resource for vintage Rolex knowledge, but at this point they've sold so many dodgy pieces that they don't deserve the benefit of the doubt whatsoever. They once called Texas dials (well-known counterfeit Paul Newman dials) ""exotic second-generation dials."" I shit you not, they called them *[exotic](https://catalog.antiquorum.swiss/en/lots/rolex-ref-6239-daytona-lot-314-416?page=1)*. They justify it by claiming Singer made them in the 1990's (even if they did, which they didn't, they'd still be counterfeit...just made by a former dial supplier). Apparently Antiquorum has been sold and gone bankrupt several times.

I think at best, these red dials are rejected prototypes made by Singer (or another dial supplier) and later fitted into an actual 6265. I'm pretty sure there are a couple Italian dudes with binders full of rejected prototype dials, gradually inserting them into period-correct watches and selling them for 5,000% more.

Watch forum legend Orchi Palar has ranted about the ""Italian mafia"" of top-tier Rolex dealers conspiring to sell sketchy franken crap, and how they effectively validate each other's crap, and how once a crap watch is sold by a ""trusted"" auction house it remains permanently ""validated."" He often gets dismissed as a crazy ranter and is banned from The Rolex Forums but honestly I think he's pretty freakin' right.  In any case, I'm quite certain these watches never left a Rolex factory like this. And they went for over 300 bands each in *2003!* That was before 6-figure Daytona sales were common.",5

The high off cocaine is extremellllly relaxing. It was like even though you were wide awake you didn't feel keyed up or wired(at least I didn't) you simply couldn't and *didn't* want to go to sleep, and you would feel so incredibly relaxed, laid back and completely just chill. Everything on cocaine was great, it had a way of making people with iron clad will not to talk about their life open up like flowers and sex don't even get me started even though you legit couldn't orgasm it just felt sooo good you didn't even want to.

All of that meant when 22 year old me moved back in with my parent's and could not find cocaine anymore I thought maybe I could get a similar high snorting pain pills and not something strong like percocet or oxycotin, just regular like ibuprofen or I think what I took was aleve or advil.

I crushed it up and took a snort INSTANT seering agony. It straight up felt like my brain was sizzling. I know that makes no sense but that's the sensation it created.

Secondly, and this seems to be a reoccurring opinion from a few people in this thread, but you seem to be confusing the lowest strength over the counter pain killers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen with prescription, high strength, and highly controlled drugs such as oxycodone or mophine. There is a HUGE difference and I'm honestly confused by the responses I'm getting suggesting doctor visits, the need for prescriptions, and passive aggressive and pandering comments such as yours suggesting I'm going to get hooked on class A drugs because I take an ibuprofen infrequently for a passing headache. 

I'm not saying people shouldn't take care even with the low strength stuff, as it can definitely be dangerous if taken incorrectly or too frequently, but honestly you bringing up a heroin epidemic in a country thousands of miles away and one which has a larger population in its 5th largest city than all of Austria is just down right stupid.",0

No they absolutely haven't. Hard drugs have not been legalised and sold in a regulated/certified manner.

Doctor prescribed pain remedies resulted in the following headline:

[In one year, drug overdoses killed more Americans than the entire Vietnam War did](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/6/15743986/opioid-epidemic-overdose-deaths-2016)

&gt; The Times can’t specify how many of the overdose deaths were caused by opioids, much less what kind of opioid — painkillers, heroin, or fentanyl — was behind the deaths. But based on the past few years’ trends and on-the-ground reports, most of the overdose deaths were likely linked to opioids and an increasing amount were linked to fentanyl.

Unfortunately, we can't break down the number of fatal marijuana overdoses vs. fatal opiate overdoses from those numbers. The lawsuits against the Sackler family have provided some better information, but we still know opiates are killing a lot of people. With that said, let's take a look at the number of marijuana overdose deaths. 

[ The truth behind the ‘first marijuana overdose death’ headlines ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/11/17/the-truth-behind-the-first-marijuana-overdose-death/?noredirect=on)

That is not the referring to the first for the year or the first of the decade. That would have been the first recorded death. Fortunately, the report isn't exactly accurate:

&gt; The report states that the child experienced an “unstable motel-living situation” and the parents admitted to drug possessions, including cannabis.

So, doctors prescribing opiates have contributed to a problem more fatal than the Vietnam War vs. doctors prescribing marijuana who prescribe something that has never killed one person. Not even one. The guidelines were written during Reefer Madness and the idea that once you smoke crack you are addicted for life. 

Dr. Carl Hart did a lot of research to show what we think we know is a lie. He literally rewrote the book on addiction research giving us a better idea of how it actually works so we have better tools to fight it. That groundbreaking research continues to save a lot of lives and challenge assumptions about addiction. It just takes guidelines time to catch up to the current decade. ",-2

Dat het werkt als een trein kan ik volledig beamen. Ik denk wel dat het 'ontzetten oppassen' echt per persoon verschilt.

Ik heb een jaar geleden ongeveer een week oxycodon voorgeschreven gehad nadat ik mijn schouder gebroken had. Gelukkig heb ik zelf geen last gehad van behoefte naar oxycodon nadat ik door m'n voorraad heen was, terwijl ik van nature voor andere dingen wel verslavingsgevoelig ben. Oxycodon had bij mij de vervelende bijwerking dat ik emotioneel heel vlak, als in heel onverschillig, werd en er niet goed meer van kon nadenken.

Toen ik anderhalve week nadat ik m'n schouder gebroken had geopereerd was, heb ik ook morfine toegediend gekregen via een infuus, maar dat vond ik nog veel erger want daardoor voelde ik dus helemaal niets meer: geen hongergevoel en bijvoorbeeld ook niet dat m'n blaas vol zat.

Als ik de verhalen van andere mensen hoor en lees, prijs ik me gelukkig dat ik zo gemakkelijk kon stoppen met het gebruik van die opioïden.",3
339,2019-04-05 14:15:40+00:00,"Ik gebruik pijstillers ja. Maar geen Oxycodon ofzo. Er is constant aandacht voor dat het zo makkelijk zou zijn om zulke zware middelen te krijgen, maar persoonlijk heb ik dat niet meegemaakt in 10 ziekenhuis opnames in 3 jaar inclusief twee intensive care verblijven. 

Ik heb één keer Oxycodon gehad vanwege mijn stoma operatie, en dat werd gewoon keurig bijgehouden en afgebouwd.  Ik herken me dus niet in de constante stroom artikelen over medici die mensen verslaafd zouden maken.

Ik slik al een aantal jaar tramadol omdat ik anders niet mijn bed uit kan van de pijn van meerdere auto immuun ziekten, maar ook dit is altijd in overleg met de arts en onder controle.

Er zijn geen alternatieve behandelmethoden voor langdurige ernstige pijn. Ik vind het zorgelijk dat hierbij alleen naar verslaving gekeken wordt, en niet naar mensen die deze middelen vanwege ernstige ziekte nodig hebben.",2

341,2019-04-05 11:28:05+00:00,"Nee, dat zijn geen opioïden maar lokale anesthetica, die leggen gewoon tijdelijk een lokale zenuw plat. 

Opioïden zijn een specifieke groep vergelijkbare pijnstillers en drugs die niet lokaal werken maar het algehele pijngevoel verminderen en een gevoel van geluk en tevredenheid geven. De bekendste pijnstiller uit deze groep is morfine, de bekendste drug is heroïne. Het grote verschil tussen deze twee is dat morfine beter werkt om het pijngevoel te verminderen, en dat heroïne beter werkt om een geluksgevoel te geven, maar feitelijk zijn deze twee stoffen zeer vergelijkbaar in structuur en werking. En allebei de stoffen zijn om die reden ook verslavend. 

Een groot probleem in Amerika (en nu beginnend in Nederland) is dat het gebruik van oxycodon zeer normaal begint te worden. Oxycodon is ook een opioïde, een lichte versie in pilvorm die voornamelijk pijnstillend werkt. Het wordt redelijk makkelijk op herhaalrecept gegeven aan mensen na operaties of aan mensen met chronische pijn. Het probleem is echter dat oxycodon óók verslavend werkt, en vooral in Amerika is er een heuse epidemie van mensen die niet meer kunnen functioneren zonder. De stap maken naar illegale vormen van opioïden om de rush te kunnen blijven voelen is ook snel gemaakt. ",8

Em nenhum dos filmes eu vi os personagens reduzidos à elementos são básicos, então não entendo sua crítica. A figura da Capitã Marvel como mulher primeiramente nunca surge (os momentos do filme que trazem isso ressaltam sua resiliência e superação). E nem num contexto crítico vejo o seu ponto se concretizando, pois os dois filmes foram bem recebidos pelas pessoas que assistiram e o público que na sua crítica deveria se sentir ultrajado recebeu os filmes muito bem.

Com todo respeito, mas eu não entendo por quê a Marvel criar um filme com negros ou mulheres com protagonista é criar tensão social. Os filmes não pregam segregações ou conflitos, eles nem enaltecem as figuras por serem negros ou mulheres: os personagens são negros, são mulheres e assim por diante, mas a narrativa jamais reduz eles à isso, e justamente por isso que os filmes fazem sucesso.

Sério, mas quem transforma em apenas o Pantera Negra em apenas o negro, ou a Carol Denvers uma mulher, é uma visão q não consegue ver um potencial fora do comum em outro tipo.

Isso vale pra qualquer herói, não só pros de minorias: é por isso que o super homem é um fazendeiro do interior dos EUA, o homem aranha um nerd do colégio, o batman um rico indignado com  injustiças... todos eles. Isso é semiótica básica  - tem um livro muito bom disso inclusive,  *Os Quadrinho - Linguagem e Semiótica - Um Estudo Abrangente da Arte Sequencial.* Isso de herois minorias serem uma coisa moderna é uma mentira deslavada e a maior prova de que propaganda, se quiser, te convence que a grama é azul. 

Agora vem a parte que gera os downvotes:

O que os ""incels"" e outras pessoas xingam justificadamente é essa instrumentalização dos personagens quando eles são minorias. Sim, todo mundo sabe que o homem aranha ser nerd que sofreu bullying é pra atrair esse público mas quantas vezes você viu a definição do herói ser essa?  Nenhuma. Porque o que o torna herói é muito mais do que isso. É a responsabilidade dele. É a forma que ele lida com sua culpa de ser omisso com o tio . É a forma que ele persevera mesmo através da sua vida pessoal conturbada. Nenhum desses heróis de minoria da marvel tem uma sombra disso. O que eles estão mudando é o conceito de herói e isso que deixa os fãs saudosistas putos, simplificar dizendo que ""eles odeiam inclusão de minorias"" é inverdade.  O que eu quero dizer é que você tem que entender que por trás das reclamações existe um motivo compreensível.

Como foder com o Brasil em 3 meses.

Outros paises tem imposto sobre dividendo porque eles nao tem outros 300 tipos de impostos.

Nos EUA existe imposto de renda e dividendos, que é inconstitucional mas eles cobram mesmo assim, imposto sobre propriedades, e imposto que voce paga no momento da compra sobre consumo e servicos.

Aqui no Brasil já se paga o ""imposto sobre dividendos"", só que ele ta embutido em todas as operações da empresa. A gente paga ICMS, ISS, COFINS, FCP (Fundo de combate a pobreza, sem zoa), IRPF, IOF e agora a CPMF que querem trazer d evolta.

Falar de imposto sobre dividendos aqui no Brasil é literalmente um atestado de retardado mental.

Outra coisa, empresas grandes simplesmente nao tem dividendos, quem é rico o suficiente pra viver de dividendos tem contador bom o suficiente pra nao pagar imposto. A Amazon por exemplo paga 0 de income tax nos EUA.

Esse imposto só serve pra foder com os pequenos negocios que nao conseguem se defender, é só mais um tiro na cara do pequeno que ta tentando sair do buraco enquanto o grande fica na boa.

E outra, o Guedes quer acabar com o SIMPLES... hoje em dia o que salva o Brasil é literalmente MEI e SIMPLES.

O MEI é a forma que o mercado usa pra contratar profissionais mais qualificados, o MEI fez mais pelo mercado de trabalho no Brasil do que aquela porra de reforma do Temer jamais sonha em fazer.

Já o SIMPLES é o jeito que as pequenas empresas operam.

Acabar com esses modos de operacao vai simplesmente acabar com o país, eles sao no momento os alicerces da classe media. Quem é rico tem empresa normal com contadores e equipe de advogados, quem é pobre ta no buraco negro da CLT... a classe média sobrevive por causa do MEI e SIMPLES.

Eu sinceramente tenho muito medo do Paulo Guedes, eu acho que ele até tem intencoes boas, mas ele vai acabar fodendo com tudo.

O que salva o pais hoje é justamente o fato de que o codigo tributario é super complexo, as empresas grandes conseguem se salvar com brechas e os pequenos conseguem se abrigar sob o MEI e o SIMPLES.

As unicas mudancas positivas sao cortes de gastos, qualquer ""reestruturacao"" vai apenas foder com tudo... vai ser aprovado só se for pra cobrar mais e o povo simplesmente nao da conta de pagar.

Obviamente que na parte de BNDES e JBS ele ta certo, ali nao tem o que discutir, mas as ""reformas"" dele me assustam. O pessoal ta tratando o Paulo Guedes como heroi, como se tudo que ele propoe esta correto, e isso sem conhecer como o mercado funciona no Brasil.

 A emissora pÃºblica NHK e outros veÃ­culos viram os procuradores entrando na casa que Ghosn ocupa temporariamente no centro de TÃ³quio para prender novamente o executivo, em meio Ã investigaÃ§Ã£o de uma nova denÃºncia contra ele. 

 Na quarta-feira, comeÃ§aram a circular rumores de que os procuradores consideravam prender Ghosn no Ã¢mbito da investigaÃ§Ã£o de uma quarta acusaÃ§Ã£o, relacionada a uma transferÃªncia de US$ 32 milhÃµes para uma distribuidora das montadoras em OmÃ£. 

 O executivo jÃ¡ enfrenta trÃªs acusaÃ§Ãµes de mÃ¡ conduta financeira ligada Ã declaraÃ§Ã£o de suas rendas. Ele nega os crimes.

Ele usou uma conta criada por seus porta-vozes para anunciar o plano de fazer uma coletiva de imprensa em 11 de abril. 

 ""Estamos nos preparando para dizer a verdade sobre o que estÃ¡ acontecendo. Coletiva de imprensa na quinta-feira, em 11 de abril"", tuitou em inglÃªs e japonÃªs. 

 Pelos termos da fianÃ§a, Ghosn nÃ£o tinha permissÃ£o de usar a internet, mas o tuÃ­te pode ter sido publicado em seu nome, como Ã© comum para celebridades e figuras de grande destaque.

 Ainda nesta quarta, o[ conselho da Renault acusou Carlos Ghosn de ""prÃ¡ticas questionÃ¡veis e ocultas""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/04/conselho-da-renault-acusa-ex-presidente-de-violar-normas-eticas-da-empresa.shtml) e de violar as normas Ã©ticas da empresa. Essa Ã© a primeira vez que a montadora francesa criticou seu ex-presidente.

 A empresa cancelou o pagamento de parte da pensÃ£o de Ghosn e revogou a bonificaÃ§Ã£o a que ele teria direito pelo ano de 2018, depois de identificar pagamentos suspeitos no Oriente MÃ©dio, e disse que se ""reserva o direito"" de mover processos contra Ghosn na JustiÃ§a francesa.

\-------------------------------------------------Converting Codeine into Morphine, then into Heroin -------------------------------------------------You will need to begin with almost pure codeine. Now, make up a caustic solution of about 200ml of water. This is done by slowly adding NaOH to the solution until it has a pH balance of 12 (use cheap pH strips). Then add 30ml of it to the codeine/water mix and then add 50ml of chloroform and shake and allow the heavier solvent to sink to the bottom. Then you must separate off the chloroform layer by using a siphon (use an eyedropper if you need to), then wash the remanding solution again with 30ml of chloroform and once again remove it. Now you must separate all the water from the solvent and I mean every last drop. All of the water must be out, and you can pipette it or use a separator of some kind (like a flask with a tap, so you shut it off when the water gets close to running through). Then evaporate off the chloroform with a pot filled with simmering water in it. Just have a plate sitting on top of the pot and slowly tip in solution and watch white crystalline codeine base appear as the chloroform reduces out by dryness. Tips: You want white codeine not brown and always use glass; its easier to clean. Next step producing Morphine from Codeine: Now, you need to then measure out about 3 grams of pyridine HCL for approximately one and a half grams of codeine and melt it in a long boiling tube (or big test-tube). Then when melted, place in the codeine and it all must dissolve and be able to swish around. Then immediately plug the tube with a tightly rolled paper napkin. It will turn different colors and it will be hard to tell when it's cooked, but let it take about 5 minutes or when the temperature hits around 230 Celsius and then it will be done, and it will stick to the sides of the tube when ready. Then tip all of it into a clean beaker with 100ml of water. Then tip some water back into the now cooler test-tube and rinse all of it out into the beaker. Next add caustic solution drop by drop till you get to pH 14 (take about 3ml of the solution stated above). You will need some pH papers. Now wash the solution with chloroform say 40ml shake well and allow to settle or centrifuge (spin), pipette off the top aqueous layer. Then drop the pH to 9 and shine a light through it; you'll see it thicken with this brown mud like shit. Don't go past 9, add one or two small drops once you hit 9 and filter that crap out. The beat way is to use a vacuum filter with really good filter paper. Now, check the pH you want it to go no lower than 7.5 (using HCL spirits of salts and hydrochloric acid) while it gets to 8pH start rubbing the sides of the beaker with a glass rod or handle of a wooden spoon right in the liquid at the water level rub hard on the beaker glass and morphine 

will seed in clouds off crystals, then filter them out and dry high above an heating element on a metal spoon (leave the dope on the filter paper and dry it then it is easy to get off it flakes off in chunks). Note: These crystalline codeine particles can be taken orally (under your tongue for faster results) or mixed in a drink, if you wish not to convert it into heroin. Now, Converting your Morphine into street quality Heroin (diacetylmorphine)Procedure: First, place some of your converted morphine into a metal spoon and add acetic anhydride and then cover with a piece of aluminum foil and bake in the oven at around 80 degrees Celsius, for at least 1 hour . Then uncover and turn the oven off. Allow the last of the acetic anhydride to sweat off the substance. Then place the remaining substance in the refrigerator. When the substance is cold, you can move it to a burner (torch lighter) and just heat till you think its at about at least 80 degree's and sniff a couple inches above it. It shouldnt sting your nose, if it does just heat it lightly some more until the smell goes away . Voila! Now the final product is street quality heroin. Ready to either be taken or sold. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",1

how could trained medical doctors not know or believe that oxycodone wouldn't be addictive, leading to the modern opiate crisis?  because like I said.  doctors don't really know much about drugs and medications.

The skills of the hero can be used at any time (similar to the battle machine).

Heroi have different abilities to be used (example great guardian

1- Increase the life of the troops (same as today)

2- Increases the damage of the troops

3-Heals the troops per second).

Anyway, these were my suggestions that, in my opinion, will make the game very interesting and will make the fans stick to the game more and love it to the fullest, Clash on! ;)

The girl is already dating a known felon and has to assume some risk of association with his criminal behavior just by dating him publicly.  The idea that she could be driven to such a degree of self harm just because she's being arrested for presumably the first time just doesn't sound very reasonable to me at all.  In response to your comment about her being ""conclusively a member of at least a few different groups"" the only groups she's ""conclusively"" a member of the based on the facts are the report are ""young"" and ""woman"" so that doesn't really add a tremendous amount of credibility to your argument.  Not to mention you're claiming(you didn't provide a statistic, just made a claim without a source) a statistic about suicides in prison and that is VASTLY different from suicide within 10 minutes of being cuffed and placed in the back of a cop car.
