Quanto a antidepressivos nao serem heroina, isso eu nao sei dizer. Vc parece ter mais conhecimento sobre o assunto que eu. Atualmente sei que os SSRIs são muito usados em tratamentos de depressao logo sao os ""antidepressivos"" da moda. Mas quem sabe no futuro a opioides ganhem esse posto, ja estao estudando o assunto.

Take a tiny tiny amount, then a slightly bigger, and so on till you're satisfied you're reacting to the a dose of the substance as expected.

27,2019-11-28 15:28:10+00:00,"Firstly, I should say that given that I’m not intimately acquainted with OP’s web app, it’s possible that a polymorphic relationship might not be the best, but I do feel like it would be worth exploring, hence why I mentioned it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully it’s super simple to implement a polymorphic relationship in Laravel. The products table only needs two fields to make this work: products\_type and product\_id. Now, these columns do not be to named this way, and can be named anything, and the product\_id would be a  different column that the actual primary key. The product\_type would hold the model name of the specific product (say, 'App\\Strain') and the product\_id would be the actual primary key id of that product in the Strains table. That's all you need for the database side.

For the model side you would just implement a method that returns the relationship. For example, the Strains model would have a method that would return `$this-&gt;morphOne('App\Product', 'products')` and then you get access to the attributes of the products table as with any other relationship: 

`$strain-&gt;product-&gt;name` 

or

`$strain-&gt;product-&gt;price` 

assuming the relationship is named product.

You could even have getter methods on the strain models to make the code more understandable, and only query the relationship under the hood. Say

    
    public function getNameAttribute()
    {
        return $this-&gt;product-&gt;name;
    }
    
    /*Then somewhere else, like a controller*/
    
    $strain-&gt;name

The inverse of the relationship would simply use the morphTo method, rather than morphOne.

The Laravel documentation has a few more examples and explanations. I'll leave you with a link in case you are interested. [https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/eloquent-relationships#polymorphic-relationships](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/eloquent-relationships#polymorphic-relationships)",1
28,2019-11-28 13:59:04+00:00,"So I actually read the article and if you would have I bet you would have not posted it.

Reading it, it makes a couple of assumptions.

1) that because men also want to care for children because of an increase of oxycotin, is a fallacy to assume it means that it has any bearing on instinct and maternal instinct.  The thought that you assumed that I was implying that a man doesn't care about his offspring is quite humorous to me. 

2) It actually confirms my position that women worked as part of a group through the vast majority of our history (tribal/huntergatherer) where the women were responsible for taking care of the children.  This is what I mean by being instinctual and natural aka reality for women.  

3) I also think in many ways were kind of agreeing and circling each other.  I think that women are instinctually and evolutionary bred to take care of children and have a immensely strong maternal instinct because they were bred that way through evolution over human history.

You're argument is that it is social construction because its what women have been doing throughout human history. I think its kind of a parrallel argument here, I think that it could be both to be honest.  Its evolutionary (supported throughout biology and the animal kingdom) but it could also be reinforced by social structure because it is the natural order of the human species.",1
29,2019-11-28 07:22:52+00:00,"My uncle Joe was a biker and he had died a few weeks earlier of a heroin/fetanyl overdose so the whole family came down from Vegas to Ohio to get together, cashing in on the guilt of uncle Joe's death. My grandma was a trainwreck. My mom had set up a shrine in the kitchen for her brother. It was his box of ashes along with his biker vest and bandana and gloves and shades. A few pictures and a beer. Grandma hardly left it the entire weekend she stayed with us. All she did was get blackout drunk and cry about her baby boy. Well, my brother Kevin and I came up with a plan. Kevin is about as close to looking like Uncle Joe as you can get without saying ""Spitting Image"". So, we had 4 or 5 hits of festival acid left from our trip to Nelson's Ledges that year, saving them up to look at this awesome Christmas Lights display in our town, but instead, we dosed Grandma. Bout an hour later she started tripping real fucking hard and Kevin put on all of Uncle Joe's stuff. He sat with Grandma and talked to her, and I'm telling you the truth when I say that she had no idea that he wasn't Uncle Joe. She let out every bit of pain and anguish she'd been feeling and Kevin just told her over and over ""It's okay Mom. It's not your fault. I'm safe and happy and I'm with Jesus now."" Shit like that. Well, it got bad around the time my parents woke up, because the acid was so strong that Grandma was still tripping balls come Thanksgiving morning. Left unattended she had tried to make the dinner all on her own and in every way possible she had ruined the food. It wasn't difficult for our parents to figure out that we had dosed Grandma. I was 22 at the time, and my dad was in his late 40's, but he beat the fuck out of me like I was 12. The cops ended up getting called and my aunt had to hide my grandma because nobody wanted any of us to go to jail. We were able to smooth it over and the cops left us with a warning, but my jaw was so sore that I couldn't eat. Dad cracked one of my ribs too, so breathing hurt like a bitch. Needless to say, it was a terrible Thanksgiving. Grandma woke up after a long nap and made us cinnamon sugar toast tho, so that was nice.",1

37,2019-11-27 15:50:35+00:00,"Norco will not *precipitate* withdrawal.   

He'll likely be in withdrawal, though, because twelve 10/325 Norco pills per day will not be nearly enough to cover his baseline opioid requirement (I realize he has enough Norco to take 13 1/3 pills per day, but the daily max for Norco is 12 pills because taking more than 4 grams of Tylenol in a day can overload the liver's ability to clear Tylenol's toxic metabolite and lead to serious hepatotoxicity).

A bit of arithmetic to explain why 12 Norco isn't enough:  

12 Norco pills x 10mg hydrocodone per pill = 120mg oral hydrocodone = 120 mg oral morphine (oral morphine and hydrocodone are equianalgesic and can be substituted in a 1:1 ratio).  

120mg oral morphine = 40mg IV morphine (as the average oral bioavailability for morphine is about 1/3)

40mg IV morphine = 10-20mg IV heroin (as IV heroin is 2-4x as potent as IV morphine).  

So, 12 Norco pills provide opioid activity equivalent to only 10 or 20 mg of (pure) IV heroin.  

To prevent *severe* withdrawal generally requires an opioid-dependent person to take at least 25% of their usual habit.  

That means if OP has been taking more than 40-80mg per day of heroin (or its equivalent in fentanyl analogues), 12 Norco just won't cover him.   

It's hard to speculate on the purity and composition of present street heroin/fentany, and OP doesn't say the size of their habit.  But unless their tolerance is miniscule and their product is particularly low-potency, they are likely taking WAAAY more than 80mg pure heroin per day (or its equivalent).  

&amp;#x200B;

I think switching to a short-acting opioid prior to bupe induction makes a lot of sense.  If I were allowed to do so, I would switch patients on methadone to morphine for a week prior to bupe induction (unfortunately, that's not legal in the United States).  I think that strategy makes even more sense when the person doesn't know the composition or purity of what they're taking.  

But that amount of Norco isn't going to cut it.  Especially on Day 2-3, when more of the fentanyl analogues are out of his system.  

Several options:

1. Try to get a larger amount of a short-acting pharmaceutical opioid.  Stay away from combo products containing Tylenol if you can because you'll hit toxic doses of Tylenol long before you've covered your baseline opioid requirement.   When I've hospitalized a patient on street dope for a few days for a medical emergency, I've had to switch them to a pharmaceutical.  There's a lot of range here, as well as occasional outliers, but for a typical patient with a typical $40-80 per day habit, it generally takes the equivalent of 250-600mg per day of oral morphine *just to keep them out of frank withdrawal.*  To keep them *comfortable* takes more (or a lot of adjunct comfort meds), and to get them any sort of pain relief from opioids takes *much* more.    It's impossible to predict what any individual patient will need, given the variation in street drug purity, the different sized habits, and individual differences in metabolism and drug response, but that's just to give you a ballpark of how much medication you'll probably need.   Getting that much pharmaceutical on the street may be difficult or expensive and doctors in the U.S. aren't allowed to prescribe them to you in these circumstances, so this may not be a realistic option.  The most realistic option may be to try to get heroin that's free of fentanyl and research chemicals.  
2. Instead of inducting onto bupe, transition using micro-doses, i.e. the Bernese method.  You can look up the details.  It wouldn't surprise me if in 10 or 20 years, this becomes the standard way of transitioning patients onto bupe.  Doctors who use this method seem to think it's superior.  The problem in the United States is that we can't prescribe low-dose bupe products (like Belbuca or Butrans) to addicts without chronic pain, and it's more difficult to microdose bupe using the products approved for opioid dependence.  Even the lowest dose bupe product for opioid dependence contains massive amounts of bupe.  It's still doable, but you'll have to liquify your bupe and measure carefully to get the microgram doses you need. 
3. Suck it up with what you've got. It won't be comfortable, but the Norco will make it somewhat easier.  Adding comfort meds could help a lot if you're able to access other medications, but you'll still be in for a few days feeling like crap.

Desde que era chico me golpeaba por cualquier cosa que hacia mal (hasta hubo un par de veces sin razon aparente), cagadas a piñas, el cinto, esas cosas. Luego en la adolesencia y mi acutal adultez los golpes disminuyeron (pero no se detuvieron) y empezaron los insultos (ya saben, porque es lo mas normal que un padre te diga inutil, enfermito, pelotudo y opa cada vez que haces algo mal o que no le gusta) y que encima no se puede hablar razonablemente y tranquilo porque cada vez te levanta mas la voz dicendo ""No me contestes mal/No me faltes el respeto"" y amenazandome de golpes, de hurto (sacandome mi computadora, celular o cualquier cosa que yo tengo), y de hecharme de la casa, llegando asi a una muy baja autoestima y pocas ganas de hacer cosas.


A mi madre le critico por no parar lo de mi padre, cuando era chico, para mi ella era ""la unica que me queria"" pero cuando creci descubri que era mi heroina porque no me golpeaba ni me insultaba como mi padre, ella ni siquiera hacia nada para evitar la conducta de mi padre, solo se limitaba a decir ""no hagas X cosa porque ya sabes como se pone"", y ya, asi solucionaba ella las cosas.

 Tambien le critico por negar todo lo que pasa en esta casa y por no querer recibir ayuda, durante la adolescencia yo me ofreci a ayudarla para sacarons de encima a mi padre, pero ella no colaboraba con nada, ni siquiera para hablar con el, a pesar de que a ella le molestaba su actitud de mierda. Ademas, desde que tengo 18 empezo a negar todos los golpes e insultos diciendo ""solo te golpeo una o dos veces"", ""bueno, algo habras hecho"", ""y era porque hiciste X cosa"" y mi favorita ""eso nunca paso"". Ademas de que el año pasado me mando un video por whatsapp que me hirvio la sangre sabiendo de todo lo que pase con mi padre, y cuando ella me vio viendo el video se me rio en la cara, luego de discutir con ella sobre el video viene con algo nuevo ""el te estaba educando"", uff, si, se merece ser profesor. (Luego paso el video en un edit)

Tambien le critico por tratar a mi hermana de la misma forma que me trato mi padre durante mi adolescencia; y por mas que le diga que no trate asi a mi hermana (por mas que sea una persona muy irresponsable) y que hay otras maneras de tratarla, dice que ""es su hija y la trata como quiere"".

56,2019-11-26 10:20:02+00:00,"&gt;It is OOC for Yukari to directly intervene in incidents, during their formulation or execution; her style of governance is lazy-faire.

She directly intervened in multiple incidents already, including this one: if she doesn't want to directly intervene here, why even ask Eirin to call Sagume?

&gt;In all likelihood the Lunarians no longer have access to the Kaian passageway because they pissed off Doremy by overstaying their welcome:

That doesn't mean they can't guard its exit. Unless they are suddenly now cool with another direct infiltration by impurity-filled beings.

&gt;Did you skip over the text? Sagume says that a youkai brought her Eirin's letter:

You need to read the sentence in context. Why would a youkai bear the letter if there are other methods? If a youkai bearing letter is somehow the best method of delivery despite all its problem, that means that other methods are blocked somehow, which mean it is extremely hard for communication to happen, so the fact that a youkai bear it further support the idea that Sagume can't just freely be in contact with Eirin and definitely can't just visit earth at will.

&gt;Because it's a letter from Eirin Yagokoro, the person whose mind and labor formed the basis for Lunarian civilization and who is your close colleague and friend? If it's from Eirin, it must be important.

Even the Watatsuki sisters didn't just go and visit Eirin right away, despite her letter. Yes she is important, but no that doesn't mean they immediately disregard all risk to their career and position to immediately do what Eirin ask. And why would Eirin ask Sagume to do something that put Sagume's position at risk just like that?

&gt;And yet AFiEU depicts her casually visiting Eientei without escorts, so clearly she has a way discreet or not to go to Earth when she pleases.

There are no reasons to suppose that this is just a casual visit, we have evidence of one visit that is only found by a very nosy reporter. It makes sense, that with enough planning in advance, she can occasionally make a secret visit to Eirin without escorts and with enough plausible deniability. It's much harder to believe, that somehow Eirin can just summon her very quickly. Remember the whole point of this discussion, you believe that Eirin didn't know about anything before hand and were able to summon Sagume on a whim when things started to go wrong; and I am pointing out why that idea is just untenable.

&gt;Have you read all of Eirin's lore? Yukari outsmarts Eirin's intelligence and tech and literally traumatized her in the ending of CiLR. Eirin fears Yukari, in the same way a villager fears a youkai. Either Yukari forced Eirin to do her bidding or Eirin choose to appease the sage.

What evidences are there that Eirin fear Yukari in the same way a random villager fear a youkai? The villagers' fear lead to submission, because it's a fear of a power beyond their ability to know and also beyond their control. Eirin's fear just lead to improved security. That's why I compare it to fearing a pickpocket; if you got pickpocket and lost your passport in a foreign country you're probably going to be scared of pickpocket for life, but that doesn't mean a pickpocket can coerce you into anything, that just mean you are much more careful next time. Eientei literally had a machine that can detect Yukari's gap.",1
57,2019-11-26 09:15:24+00:00,"&gt;Since she planned out the whole thing by herself, it's hard to see her as being that stupid. Of course, she did ask for Seija to help, and Okina was giving it a push, but she's still the mastermind here.

She is intelligent, but in a Tenshi sort of way.

&gt; The fact still is that people care enough about trying to capture Seija (even if it's just for the bounty), and actively try to capture her; and it is still true that banned spell cards were allowed. They care enough about capturing Seija before, for whatever reason even if it's just the bounty, then why not now?

Either they legitimately forgot about her (incidents happen all the time in Gensokyo) or they really don't care too much about the amanojaku. Most 2hus to hold grudges.

&gt;It's not hard to see how either Yukari or Eirin would have got wind of it. Yukari had her spies and not to mention she's extremely likely to be on the look out for problems in general, and she also believed that the moon had spies too. I think it's much more likely that Yukari got wind of it early and ask Eirin for help, because of the communication problem below...

Yukari likely, but Eirin doesn't pay attention to events that aren't related to Eientei or the Moon. 

It is OOC for Yukari to directly intervene in incidents, during their formulation or execution; her style of governance is lazy-faire.

&gt;The Lunarian know about the Kaian passage and do have problems with earthling impurity, so that one should be under strict guard.

In all likelihood the Lunarians no longer have access to the Kaian passageway because they pissed off Doremy by overstaying their welcome: 

&gt;&gt; However, it seems that this plan was bothersome to her, and she didn't feel like playing along.

&gt;&gt;Also, it had been over half a year already, but there was still no sign of progress.

&gt;&gt;...

&gt;&gt;Her true intent was to get a little bit of payback.

&gt;&gt;She sent the human off to the true Lunar Capital, just as they desired.

-LoLK, Doremy's Omake

Doremy would be open to sending youkai through for a little more revenge.

&gt;And why would it be a youkai who bear the letter?

Did you skip over the text? Sagume says that a youkai brought her Eirin's letter:

&gt;&gt;I didn't know what to think when **a youkai arrived on the moon bearing a letter from Lady Yagokoro**.

-GoU, Section 2-8

This isn't speculation, this is what canonically happens in the book.

&gt;Then you have to consider Sagume's motivation. Why would she acted on it right away, when she doesn't even know what's going on?

Because it's a letter from Eirin Yagokoro, the person whose mind and labor formed the basis for Lunarian civilization and who is your close colleague and friend? If it's from Eirin, it must be important.

The letter couldn't have been faked either: 

&gt;&gt;As I wrote, I became afraid that somebody might read it or alter it en route, so I affixed a quantum seal. A quantum seal is a special type of seal that uses the state of the subatomic particles inside the letter to keep track of how many people have read it. This device was an invention of mine, and since I'm still the only person who can make one, it also served as proof that I wrote the letter. I set two or three other devices to it as well, and finally sealed it with medicinal herbs.

-CiLR, Chapter 1

Eirin has a special seal for her letters that only she can create, making forgery effectively impossible. Sagume has no fear of deception.

&gt;She couldn't have been visited earth regularly as part of her official duty

And yet AFiEU depicts her casually visiting Eientei without escorts, so clearly she has a way discreet or not to go to Earth when she pleases.

&gt;Eirin might be scared of Yukari, but only somewhat, in the sense the Yukari was able to outsmart Eirin. Eirin still have superior technology and knowledge. Eirin is only scared of Yukari in the same way people are scared of pickpocket: they can cause serious trouble if you let your guard down, but they can't actually coerce you into doing anything.

Have you read all of Eirin's lore? Yukari outsmarts Eirin's intelligence and tech and literally traumatized her in the ending of CiLR. Eirin *fears* Yukari, in the same way a villager fears a youkai. Either Yukari forced Eirin to do her bidding or Eirin choose to appease the sage. 

&gt;The easiest method is to just put a stop to the whole thing (as mentioned, they must have known in advance)...

60,2019-11-25 20:50:48+00:00,"&gt;Stupid Shinmy is intended.

Since she planned out the whole thing by herself, it's hard to see her as being that stupid. Of course, she did ask for Seija to help, and Okina was giving it a push, but she's still the mastermind here.

&gt;I think that the whole ISC thing was not so serious in the end. If they had truly wanted to capture such a large threat they wouldn't have used spell cards.

The fact still is that people care enough about trying to capture Seija (even if it's just for the bounty), and actively try to capture her; and it is still true that banned spell cards were allowed. They care enough about capturing Seija before, for whatever reason even if it's just the bounty, then why not now?

&gt;Eirin was an attendee to the firework festival, not a planner. How was she going to know ahead of time that Shinmy and her gang were going to ruin it? Even if she did know, would she stop such trouble on her volition?

The event planners (Reimu and co.) didn't know either. However, Shinmyoumaru were sending out a lot of invitation (or just talk to a lot of people) in advace, so while her plans might be a bit underground, it's not exactly in secret. It's not hard to see how either Yukari or Eirin would have got wind of it. Yukari had her spies and not to mention she's extremely likely to be on the look out for problems in general, and she also believed that the moon had spies too. I think it's much more likely that Yukari got wind of it early and ask Eirin for help, because of the communication problem below...

&gt;Yukari could have almost instantaneously communicated with Eirin directly or indirectly through her gaps. The letter to the moon is stated to have been explicitly delivered to Sagume by a youkai (either Ran or Yukari herself), so it was not sent days or weeks in advance.

The problem is, passage to the moon is difficult. The Lunarian know about the Kaian passage and do have problems with earthling impurity, so that one should be under strict guard. Yukari's gap need specific condition to work, and that still doesn't let you into the capital. Unless it's a Lunarian approved personnel, it should be very difficult to get in. Youkai is especially easy to detect due to their impurity, so it's not like they can just sneak in. And why would it be a youkai who bear the letter? If Sagume frequently visit earth enough, she could have established a more secure communication channel with Eirin, perhaps using a letter bearer that had been approved somehow using some other pretext that let them come to earth; and that approved letter bearer is not going to be a youkai. This indicates that Eirin lack any fast and easy communication with Sagume. And why not use those wave-based technology for communication but letter? That must mean the Lunarian do monitor those form of communication and that they would have problems with Sagume contacting Eirin, so Sagume can't just use them for contact.

Then you have to consider Sagume's motivation. Why would she acted on it right away, when she doesn't even know what's going on? She would have taken time to mull it over. And let's say she decided right away, she still need to somehow get an excuse to just visit earth. She couldn't have been visited earth regularly as part of her official duty (see: communication channel above), so maybe she had some duty that require her to come to earth occasionally, which mean she would still need to make up some excuse to go. And then she need to ditch her escort somehow, or maybe they're in the know; but it's hard to believe they are just common moon rabbits who are known to gossip, too risky. All of that, in a matter of minutes to hours, with all that risks, to do something she didn't even understand (at the time). Then there might be a need to send back a confirmation that she would come (since they knew Sagume is coming). Add in all that, and that means the whole things must have taken days. They definitely knew it in advance.

Then next is Eirin's motivation. For some very small incidence like this, why would Eirin ask Sagume for help? Eirin surely know the difficulty and risk for getting a letter to Sagume, and then the difficulty and risk for Sagume to come. Why would Eirin put Sagume under such risk? Why would Eirin use her personal connection to her allies so carelessly? Eirin might be scared of Yukari, but only somewhat, in the sense the Yukari was able to outsmart Eirin. Eirin still have superior technology and knowledge. Eirin is only scared of Yukari in the same way people are scared of pickpocket: they can cause serious trouble if you let your guard down, but they can't actually coerce you into doing anything.

Not to mention, Sagume is far from the only way to avoid a disaster. The easiest method is to just put a stop to the whole thing (as mentioned, they must have known in advance). Let's say if they don't want to put a stop to it, for some unknown reason. At the minimum, they could have increased security, for example, say, by telling Reimu and co. about it in advance, and having someone block off the underground passage. And put a stop on the whole party crashing before it gains momentum and become chaos. The only reason they even let the party crashing gain momentum is because they knew Sagume is coming, otherwise they could have put a stop to it right at the start.",1

Decades!!! After the Galactic Empire is thwarted, the galaxy breaks off into multiple factions, none of which are inherently evil, and the galaxy falls into general disorder. Border skirmishes and piracy plague the many parts of the galaxy as its everyone is trying to get a slice of that sweet space pie.

Insert strong female lead, you can even call her Rey ffs, stereotypical orphin working as a pilot for some space pirates. Her crew is working a job, trying to rob some shit, getting that sweet space pie from some noble man in some lame part of the galaxy.

But wait, this slice of pie was more heavily guarded than they thought. Most of her crew died in the attempt, but because of the fucking force (plot armor **cough cough**) she was merely imprisoned.

In prison, she meets the noble man, but wait it's another woman! A young, arrogant piece of work (who will later show herself as a soft soul, hardening herself for survival in a world of cut throat politics). She also meets Finn (I guess), who is working as a guard for our noble bitch. He attempts to treat her well but she lived that pirate life and don't need no one helping her, so she says ""get bent bruv""

**BOOM** the noble space manor has been attacked by mysterious forces and... Holy shit?!? That dude has a lightsaber. Oh dang our protagonists are in trouble now!! But wait! The force, again, carries our flawed heroes to safety... Rey, Finn and our noble lady escape with Finn's ass kicking moves, Rey's slick space drifting and Noble Lady's ability to make good decisions in a pinch and keep the other two grounded.

They proceed to be chased, which gives us the character friction conflict that will strain, but ultimately strengthen their relationship.

That's about all I got, but essentially the dude with the lightsaber is an assassin hired by another noble or something. This movie would largely be a kick start to what could be an expanding story. Finn and the Noble lady would probably couple up, and Rey and the assassin would eventually be forced to temporarily work together, form a bond but inevitably fight a final battle after a well built, moral conflict with one another.",1

It's a strong steroid cream but if the Morphea patch isn't in flare-up,  you can use the Clobetasol twice a week instead if twice a day.  My patch is on my right thigh/hip. I do regular sun exposure for 10-15 min a day as often as possible but the Clobetasol helps lighten &amp; soften. I've heard it's used on the underground for ppl who want to lighten their skin color also. It helps me with my patch, which grows bigger when having a flare. I switch between Tacrolomis (maintenance) &amp; Clobetasol (elephant tranquilizer potent) depending in severity.  Even when not in flare, I use the Clobetasol (very little bit) &amp; Tacrolomis once a week each. But remember,  it's a steroid, so it's strong. Get medical advice on that. It's a prescription obviously.",1

I find a very little sun direct (10 minutes) on my plaques (with sunscreen) makes them softer. I tried this after reading about it on a Morphea site. 

I have a gene mutation I found when doing 23 &amp; me that showed I don't  absorb Folic Acid.

I take Methyl folate now (folic acid already converted into what your body can absorb) &amp; my liver function panel is WAY better. Gene mutation is called MTHFR.

People shouldnt really mix BDO with ethanol since the alcohol will be broken off by your liver first, leaving BDO circulating in your blood/body for a long time (you DO NOT want that with BDO) and the BDO will be as good as ineffective till your liver had delt with the alcohol. With all downsides to it (damage from toxicity, dosing to much BD or to fast so it all hits u after the drank etc) and its a waste of both drugs AND your health and time.

I personally like cocaïne, mdma, a benzo, oxycodon or phenibut as combo. I smoke weed 24/7 too and that goes with anything tbh.

96,2019-11-22 23:34:50+00:00,"I remember the when I woke up from a 2 hour surgery. As an experienced phlebotomist and knowledged patient in a specific vein in my arms that LOOKS great but nobody should absolutely ever use (it infiltrates into a massive, golfball-softball-sized hematoma every time it's VP'd), I got into a mild arguement with the anesthesiologist before procedure to *not use that vein*, even though she was pretty much drooling at it and I told her my antecubital veins were fantastic and to use those and why.

Me, making a *very big mistake* and I don't know exactly how I fell for this but I still beat myself up for it because I should have known *way* better, let the nurses talk me into taking anxiety medication orally not thinking anything about why.

Things got blurry, I remember them taking me into OR, and going to sleep, then waking up. The nurse told me everything went well except for a minor complication. I ask and she tells me my anesthesia IV infiltrated into my muscle, causing inflation in my arm that would clear up after 8 hours-ish. I lift my arm, see a massive hematoma trail going down it from the bad nono do not touch vein, and am unable to bend my elbow. Then I realize what's really wrong.

**My whole arm looks like a Shrek arm.**

I was so distracted by morphene, post-surgery pain, etc that I can't even process the behemoth arm in front of me, but I do notice that the IV is neatly placed in my other arm in an antecubital vein.

102,2019-11-22 07:28:41+00:00,"That's great news. I'm always in awe of people who can taper like that and not give in to temptation, but I've stopped beating myself up about it as I've slowly realised it wasn't my fault.

I'm having the same problems sleeping, but for totally the opposite reason. I'm on so much morphine it's sedating me so much I cannot stay asleep for very long and keep having to get up and pee every couple of hours. I've fallen into a pattern of staying awake for 24-32 hours and then sleeping with those breaks of wakefulness for about 12 hours. I'm on 60mg of XR morphine twice a day with ""rescue"" doses of up to 20-40mg of Oramorph every four hours.

I did crush some up to defeat the controlled release and got far too high that I was throwing up. It's odd when you have enough opiates to get wrecked and find out you really don't like it that much.

I can't be prescribed benzos or z-drugs as the risk of respiratory depression is too high. I still have some buprenorphine which I'm keeping as an emergency home-brew version of Narcan as it will bring on precipitated withdrawals if I go too far.

That feeling of ""missing something"" is totally normal - it's called post-acute withdrawal syndrome or PAWS ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-acute-withdrawal\_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-acute-withdrawal_syndrome) ) and can last months, or even years if you've been abusing smack for a very long time. I've always found my PAWS from codeine/DHC to last about a month before I started to feel better. I've never had it when I've swapped from a full agonist to Subutex as it's still activating the opiate receptors.

It's because our feeling of wellbeing and contentment is based on endorphins - notice the ""orphin"" as in mORPHINe, buprenORPHINe, diamORPHINe (smack) etc. - they are called endogenous opioids and are naturally present in our body. Stuff like morphine, oxycodone, heroin, DHC etc. are exogenous opioids and slowly replace endorphins as the control for our feeling of well-being. 

PAWS is your body adjusting to having to produce a normal amount of endorphins as it's gotten lazy and not bothered producing the correct amount as the exogenous opiates have done the job for it. The stronger and longer you've been on opiates the longer it takes for PAWS to wear off and the more severe the initial WD symptoms and PAWS. You will also miss the pill-popping and knowing that dropping x amount of pills will take your problems away for a while. This is much like quitting fags as you miss the whole ceremony of making a brew, rolling a fag, going outside, actually smoking etc.

You should start to feel physically better next week and emotionally more centred and controlled by Christmas. It sounds a long time, but it really isn't. As soon as your sex drive returns (if it has been turned down or off by the codeine/DHC) starting having it - lots of it. That will produce a rush of endogenous endorphins, which is why the IV heroin or morphine rush feels so good as it's basically an artificial orgasm.

The best way to think about it is you've got through the worst part - getting down to jumping off without giving in to temptation even when you can't sleep. You've got the journey through PAWS to look forward to, and I do mean look forward to as each day you will feel better than the last. Soon you'll be looking forward to waking up in the morning as you know you will feel better.",1

 ### PAPEL

 A situação, no entanto, não é tranquila: o Ministério Público Eleitoral já deu parecer contrário e ministros do TSE tendem a rejeitar a inovação.

  ### LÁPIS

 O advogado Admar Gonzaga, que está à frente da formação do novo partido, afirma que o grupo de Bolsonaro não está contando com a possibilidade de assinaturas digitais. “Essa narrativa foi criada pela imprensa”, afirma ele.

 ### DOBRO

 “Em primeiro lugar, poucas pessoas têm assinaturas certificadas. E elas teriam que ser conferidas no cartório. Seria o dobro do trabalho”, segue Gonzaga.

 ### FIEL

 A coleta de assinaturas, diz ele, deve ser rápida: a página da legenda no Instagram já tem 416 mil seguidores. “Já imaginou quantas assinaturas conseguiremos [em grupos como os evangélicos?](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/11/aliados-de-bolsonaro-vao-recorrer-a-movimentos-e-a-evangelicos-para-criar-sigla.shtml)”, afirma.

 ### AMOR

 Bolsonaro “detestava”, por exemplo, o colunista de rádio [Augusto Nunes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/11/augusto-nunes-e-chamado-de-heroi-e-covarde-em-serie-de-edicoes-na-wikipedia.shtml), da Jovem Pan, segundo Bebianno. “Eu promovi uma aproximação entre os dois e hoje ele ama o Augusto”, afirma o ex-ministro.

 ### PORTA-VOZ

 Na segunda parte editada da entrevista, que vai ao ar até o fim da semana, Bebianno diz que, na condição de articulador de Bolsonaro, sondou Nunes para assumir a Secom (Secretaria de Comunicação), do governo —mas ele recusou. O ex-ministro também diz ter procurado Claudio Dantas, do site O Antagonista, para a função —mas ele também “rejeitou de plano”.

 A petista descreve como uma de suas últimas trincheiras [um processo que move desde setembro de 2016](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/09/1818353-defesa-de-dilma-entra-com-pedido-no-stf-para-anular-impeachment.shtml) no STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) com esse objetivo. Nesta sexta-feira (22), a corte deve analisar um recurso dela para que o caso seja novamente examinado.

 [Dilma](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/governando-da-bonanca-a-crise-dilma-foi-derrubada-por-impeachment-ouca-podcast.shtml), que é defendida no caso por seu ex-ministro da Justiça José Eduardo Cardozo, [acumula derrotas no tribunal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/10/1824652-stf-nega-pedido-de-dilma-para-anular-processo-de-impeachment.shtml). Na fase atual, ela aguarda o julgamento de embargos de declaração com efeitos infringentes, um tipo de contestação em que pede explicações adicionais sobre decisão anterior e requer novo julgamento.

 Para a petista, embora seja impossível que [uma eventual invalidação do impeachment](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/09/1918408-janot-se-manifesta-contra-dilma-em-acao-no-stf-para-anular-impeachment.shtml) a leve de volta ao cargo, o reconhecimento de que o processo foi fraudulento ajudaria a ""restabelecer a verdade"" sobre o que ela vê como ""golpe parlamentar justificado por uma retórica manca"".

  O julgamento do recurso está programado para ocorrer no plenário virtual, onde a tramitação é mais célere que no plenário físico.

 São dois os pleitos da ex-presidente no momento: 1) que a decisão monocrática (individual) proferida em dezembro de 2018 pelo [ministro Alexandre de ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/fala-de-janot-incitou-ataque-a-juiza-em-sp-diz-alexandre-de-moraes.shtml?utm_source=folha&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_campaign=topicos)[Moraes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/fala-de-janot-incitou-ataque-a-juiza-em-sp-diz-alexandre-de-moraes.shtml?utm_source=folha&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_campaign=topicos), refutando a nulidade da deposição, seja revista por colegiado do STF; e 2) que a análise seja feita em sessão presencial.

 No dia 12 deste mês, os advogados dela reivindicaram a transferência do caso para o plenário físico, sob o argumento de que se trata de mandado de segurança impetrado por [uma ex-presidente ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/dilma-termina-em-4o-lugar-e-fica-fora-do-senado-em-minas.shtml)e que o tema é de notável relevância.

 Eles explicaram ainda que esse formato daria aos defensores a chance de fazer sustentação oral no tribunal. Moraes, que é o relator da ação, rejeitou o pedido. Afirmou que ""o julgamento em ambiente virtual não prejudica a discussão sobre a matéria"".

 O recurso que está em debate deu entrada na corte em dezembro de 2018, dias depois que o relator negou a demanda original de Dilma. Ele afirmou na decisão que não caberia ao STF interferir no ""mérito de decisões políticas proferidas no impeachment"".

 ​Moraes escreveu ainda desconhecer ""qualquer comprovação de [ilegalidade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/05/1771366-impeachment-fica-fora-de-base-sobre-golpes.shtml)"" no processo.

 Nos embargos, os advogados afirmaram que desde a juventude Dilma ""sempre teve como valor orientador da sua vida a perspectiva de que quem suporta um mal com valentia depois conquista um bem"".

 ""Com a mesma valentia que suportou [as torturas que lhe foram impingidas pela ditadura militar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-volta-a-chamar-ustra-de-heroi-nacional-e-recebe-viuva-no-planalto.shtml), tem sabido suportar as dores da injustiça perpetrada por um golpe parlamentar, e por todas as traições e calúnias que ainda hoje são lançadas contra ela.""

 A petista, na defesa, disse que a anulação do [impeachment](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/impeachment-impediu-reforma-da-previdencia-anterior-afirma-dilma.shtml) resgataria ""a verdade aos olhos das gerações futuras"".

 Entre as teses invocadas por Dilma, estava a de que houve desvio de poder do então presidente da Câmara dos Deputados, Eduardo Cunha (MDB), na decisão de [abrir o processo para retirá-la da Presidência](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/asmais/2016/08/1808752-relembre-a-tramitacao-do-impeachment-de-dilma-rousseff.shtml). Seria um ""vício insanável"" do procedimento.

 Segundo ela, Cunha —[preso desde 2016](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/stf-nega-pedido-para-diminuir-pena-do-ex-deputado-eduardo-cunha.shtml) em decorrência da Operação Lava Jato— [agiu por vingança](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/04/1757258-cardozo-dira-que-cunha-agiu-por-vinganca-pessoal-em-impeachment.shtml), depois que o PT se negou a fazer um acordo para barrar a [cassação do mandato dele](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/06/1779059-voto-sobre-cunha-deve-ser-repensado-diz-presidente-do-conselho-de-etica.shtml) na Comissão de Ética da Câmara.

 A ex-presidente afirmou ainda que a tramitação do impeachment foi ""marcada por inconstitucionalidades e ilegalidades"" e que não houve a comprovação de justa causa para configurar [crime de responsabilidade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/04/1761191-stf-esta-aberto-para-discutir-se-dilma-cometeu-crime-de-responsabilidade-diz-lewandowski.shtml) dela.

 Houve, na visão da petista, ""imoralidade explícita e hipocrisia"", sem ""qualquer acusação de corrupção"", a não ser a ""mera invocação da prática de [atos de gestão orçamentária](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/04/1757921-pedaladas-fiscais-dispararam-sob-dilma-diz-relatorio-do-banco-central.shtml) que todos os governos anteriores praticaram"", as famosas [pedaladas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/06/1786059-dilma-agiu-para-liberar-credito-mas-nao-em-pedaladas-diz-pericia-do-senado.shtml).

 Na petição ao STF, [Dilma](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/04/1872427-marcelo-odebrecht-fez-delacaozinha-apos-sofrer-coacao-afirma-dilma.shtml) também atacou seu ex-vice, [Michel Temer (MDB)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/11/aplaudido-temer-sugere-que-amigos-do-mbl-liderem-um-processo-para-acalmar-o-pais.shtml). Disse que ""a deslealdade pessoal, política e institucional talvez venha a ser o único legado concreto do governo"" dele, que ela chama de [ilegítimo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/06/reprovacao-aumenta-e-torna-temer-o-presidente-mais-impopular-da-historia.shtml).

 A ex-presidente reclamou ainda que o STF descumpriu prazos processuais ""sem nenhuma justificativa plausível"". A demora impediu, na sua ótica, que ela retornasse ao governo a tempo de concluir o mandato.

 ""De fato, o mandato já acabou. Retomar agora é impossível"", diz Cardozo à **Folha**. ""Estou buscando garantir o direito de apresentar a sustentação oral da defesa, o que é inviável no sistema eletrônico.""

 Para o ex-ministro, o plenário virtual deveria ser usado para ações menos complexas, ""não o caso de retirada do cargo de uma presidente, algo de ampla relevância para o direito constitucional brasileiro"".

 Procurada, a assessoria da ex-presidente não quis se manifestar sobre o julgamento.

 ### TESE DO GOLPE

 A bandeira da anulação do impeachment chegou a mover círculos petistas entre 2016 e 2017. Grupos de apoiadores de Dilma e líderes do partido [lançaram movimentos em prol da causa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/08/1913353-tiete-de-dilma-aposentada-de-sp-caca-assinaturas-para-anular-impeachment.shtml), mas a campanha arrefeceu.

 Nos últimos meses, alas do PT celebraram declarações de opositores que corroboraram a tese de que a ex-mandatária foi [vítima de golpe](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/05/1772555-dilma-e-notificada-pelo-stf-para-explicar-por-que-se-diz-vitima-de-golpe.shtml).

 Em outubro, o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), [disse que Temer operou o processo que retirou Dilma](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/temer-operou-processo-de-impeachment-de-dilma-diz-rodrigo-maia.shtml).

 O próprio Temer, em setembro, [utilizou a palavra ""golpe"" para se referir à destituição da petista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/nelsondesa/2019/09/bilhoes-em-armas-dos-eua-nao-protegeram-sauditas-diz-wp.shtml). Depois ele falou que empregou a expressão porque ""as pessoas diziam que era"".

 Também em setembro, o ex-senador Aloysio Nunes Ferreira (PSDB), um dos defensores do afastamento, [disse à **Folha** que](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/lava-jato-manipulou-impeachment-de-dilma-diz-aloysio-nunes-do-psdb.shtml) houve uma ""manipulação política do impeachment"" pela força-tarefa da Lava Jato em Curitiba e pelo ex-juiz [Sergio Moro](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/sergio-moro/), atual ministro da Justiça.

128,2019-11-20 15:02:02+00:00," Responsável por dar ao Real Madrid o título da [Liga dos Campeões da Europa de 2018](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/05/real-madrid-derrota-liverpool-e-ganha-liga-dos-campeoes-pela-3a-vez-seguida.shtml), o galês **Gareth Bale** se permitiu participar de uma brincadeira que deve desagradar, e muito, à torcida e à direção do clube.

 Depois de o País de Gales obter a vaga na Eurocopa de 2020 ao superar a Hungria por 2 a 0 em Cardiff, nesta terça (19), o atacante festejou com os companheiros, feliz da vida, segurando uma bandeira com os dizeres: “Gales. Golfe. Madri. Nessa ordem”.

 Torcedores galeses elaboraram essa bandeira em alusão à suposta preferência maior do ídolo pela seleção de seu país e pelo golfe – [passatempo predileto de Bale](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/01/22/astro-do-real-madrid-diz-preferir-ver-golfe-do-que-neymar-e-companhia/) – do que pelo gigante madrilenho.

 Antes de a bandeira aparecer, surgiu o cântico dos torcedores (“Gales, golfe, Madri”), entoado depois de outra vitória por 2 a 0, diante do Azerbaijão, em Baku, no sábado (16).

 Os fãs criaram essa sequência com base em uma declaração feita no fim do mês passado por Predrag “Pedja” Mijatovic, atacante (bom) do Real na metade final do século 20.

 “Ele [Bale] pensa primeiro na seleção de Gales, depois no golfe e depois no Real Madrid. É o que ele deixa transparecer. Nunca se sabe se pode contar com ele, se está ou não motivado, se está ou não lesionado. Mas verão como ele estará bom quando os jogos pela seleção se aproximarem”, afirmou o montenegrino, que é comentarista da rádio espanhola Cadena Ser.

 Bale posa, a caráter, ao lado de estátua do jogador escocês de golfe Bernard Gallacher em junho de 2018 (Reprodução/Instagram de Gareth Bale) [Herói do título do Real contra o Liverpool](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/05/heroi-da-final-da-liga-dos-campeoes-fala-em-sair-cristiano-ronaldo-tambem.shtml) na Champions League do ano passado, quando entrou no decorrer da final e fez dois gols, um deles de bicicleta, Bale, hoje com 30 anos, tem convivido com contusões frequentes desde sua chegada ao time, no meio de 2013.

 Para tirá-lo do Tottenham, o clube espanhol [desembolsou € 100 milhões](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2016/01/23/o-contrato-de-bale-e-o-ego-de-cristiano-ronaldo/) (R$ 464 milhões pelo câmbio atual), à época o mais alto valor investido em um futebolista.

 Desde então, teve nada menos que 24 lesões, ou uma a cada três meses, em média. Assim, engrenar séries de partidas pela equipe foi algo pouco visto.

 Ao comentar antes do jogo contra os húngaros a respeito da musiquinha da torcida, um sorridente Bale, que já declarara sua predileção por atuar pelo País de Gales (“são meus amigos, falam a minha língua”), disse que a tinha escutado e a considerado “bem divertida”.

 A mídia britânica divertiu-se com essa afirmação… porém a espanhola grunhiu.

 Ao dançar festivamente com a bandeira que posiciona o Real Madrid como sua terceira prioridade, Bale brincou com fogo.

 Se seus extintores, ou os de seus representantes, não estiverem muito bem carregados nos próximos dias, não é improvável que [Florentino Pérez](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2017/06/05/presidente-do-real-madrid-banca-zidane-pelo-resto-da-vida-mas-discurso-e-enganoso/), o presidente do Real, ceda à pressão de enraivecidos fãs merengues, e de uma ou duas dezenas de dirigentes/conselheiros irritados, e decida pela dispensa do galês.

 Pois, por mais que tenha sido uma brincadeira (será?, pois às vezes Bale passa mesmo a impressão de gostar mais de jogar golfe do que de atuar pelo Real), essa teve um tom claríssimo de pilhéria.

 E, em se tratando de paixão clubística, com certas coisas não se brinca.

 Capitão de sua seleção, Bale festeja ao lado de Aaron Ramsey (10) a classificação do País de Gales para a Eurocopa de 2020 depois da vitória por 2 a 0 sobre a Hungria em Cardiff (Andrew Boyers – 19.nov.2019/Reuters) *Em tempo **1**: A próxima janela europeia de negociações está perto (janeiro), e ventila-se a possibilidade de haver um acerto entre Real Madrid e Manchester United, com o retorno de Bale para a Inglaterra e a ida do francês [Paul Pogba](https://omundoeumabola.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/07/19/o-marcante-discurso-de-pogba-contra-a-argentina/), campeão mundial com a França em 2018, para a Espanha. *

 *Em tempo 2: Junto com o País de Galês há outras 19 nações já classificadas para a Eurocopa de 2020, que será realizada em junho e julho próximos. São elas: Alemanha, Espanha, França, Itália, Inglaterra, Portugal, Holanda, Bélgica, Croácia, Rússia, Polônia, Suécia, Suíça, Ucrânia, Turquia, República Tcheca, Dinamarca, Finlândia e Áustria.

Idk why, but anytime someone even brings up the idea that the majority of opiates problems are from society, not the drug itself, tons of bitter people come out of the woodwork shitting on it. This is especially common with ex-addicts: it's like that one guys post a couple days ago, who had been sober for a couple years but had an operation and got pain meds. He had tricked himself in hating opiates and thinking they were disgusting (but the moment the high kicked in, he felt like he was finally home. Things were simple).

Listen, it's not the opiates itself. Stop being brainwashed. Yes, your use of opiates have resulted in a ton of suffering. But being against their legalization merely serves to perpetuate that suffering in others, as things won't change.

All of your suffering from addiction could have been completely avoided: 99% of it was due to outside forces, like people, the law, and money. If those forces weren't present, you wouldn't have experienced those awful things.

Withdrawal, overdose, all due to the ridiculous price and lack of quality control. Stealing, no money, legal troubles, job troubles. Again, all due to outside circumstances.

Think about when your family found out. Why was it bad? Because all of your family has been brainwashed into becoming toxic as fuck once they find out you're a user. If it was treated like a medication nobody would even mention it.

Think about how hard treating your anxiety would be if all anti-anxiety drugs had huge heroin-like stigma + illegality. It'd be impossible to use without problems.

It's like with weed. Why was being a pothead so stressful 20-30 years ago, or even today in some places? Because if your family found out, they'd flip their shit cuz they'd been brainwashed to think it was pure poison. Because of the law.

It's acceptable to be anti-fentanyl, as that truly should not be widely available as most people are simply too careless to use it properly. But the majority of opiates (heroin, morphine, codones, morphones) are actually incredibly safe when 99% pure, both in the short- and long-term.

I know I am correct because I've read all the safety data for all opiates (they're safe and benign). I know I'm correct because of how people prescribed opiates for pain have 100% normal lives (until they're cut off, and then suddenly their life falls apart, proving my point again that it's outside factors that cause the problems). I know I'm right because we can see how addicts in Europe and Canada prescribed opiates like heroin or hydromorphone or morphine return to having normal lives, because they're getting pure opiates at cheap or free prices. I know I'm right because we can see how people on methadone or buprenorphine return to having normal lives as long as they don't continue using illegal opiates (even though methadone and bupe are far worse in every way than normal opiates).

I know I'm right because for 200 years opiates of all kinds were widely available in the US legally and cheaply, and even children could and did buy them (and they were even given to children like we give children DXM today). Morphine and heroin were widely available in both the US and Europe for 200 years, and the entire concept of a junkie didn't even exist, because addicts didn't have any financial troubles. There wasn't giant populations or homeless addicts who stole or whores themselves out for money. It was so affordable, a low wage job could easily afford their daily dose. 

And even when both heroin and morphine were widely available, legal, and extremely cheap, only .5% of the population ever used it. Completely debunking another of the do-gooders ideas, that ""if x drug were legal, then *everybody* would be addicts!"". These world-nannies actually think the majority of people would instantly start using drugs if they became legal, as if illegality is the only thing holding them back from becoming addicts. This is easily proven untrue considering we HAVE had those scenarios and 99% of society never touched those drugs. 

We must stop perpetuating these myths. The sooner we can get to legalization, or at least prescriptions of opiates as maintenance drugs, the sooner this madness stops.",1
142,2019-11-19 19:54:42+00:00,"Yeah, if you want to get more out of it, plugging is the way to go.  Depending on the route of administration, morphine has widely differing bioavailabilities, .  

Nasal  - 20%  
Oral    - 30%
Rectal - 70%  

Try plugging 20mg to start out with.  20mg of plugged Morphine is roughly equal to taking either 40mg Hydrocodone or 30mg Oxycodone orally.

And you're right, morphine is much more potent that Hydrocodone, but when taken orally, just like it's cousins Hydromorphone(35%BA), and Oxymorphone(15%BA), a considerable amount of the drug is destroyed by first-pass metabolism, making them less potent.

To make things a little more simple, eat your *Codones, and plug your *Morphones to get the most out of them.",1

144,2019-11-19 17:10:06+00:00,"Man as someone who's taking them all MDMA is way easier to cope with than shrooms or acid. I wouldn't want to be looking after my 19 year old sister high on acid at a music festival. Sounds far too stressful. Acid and shrooms can be so intense for some people first time so not sure i'd recommend it. I don't think MDMA is really addictive as the more you take it the lamer it gets and eventually you just get bored of taking it. That is litterlay what happened to me and all of my friends during our uni days. 

MDMA is relitively safe assuming it's a pure form. If you're buying it in pills then I'd recommend getting a test kit for it. Heard on a podcast they are cutting them with fentinyl now which obviously makes it way more dangerous. I'd probably just get a test kit anyway if you're going to do it. No harm in doing it properly and it will teach your siblings that when you do do drugs like this you're far more cautious which might make them more cautious in the future e.g. they wont just randomly take any drugs off someone and would rather test it like their big brother does.",1

148,2019-11-19 12:25:07+00:00,"Avoid the sun! Lather up on sun screen and cover up. Your patches get significantly darker with exposure to UV rays. Make sure you're always bundled up, inside and protected from the sun. 

The tacrolimus is really to help your skin not get dry and flakey, which helps keep your patches soft and malleable so you don't lose mobility. This is scary, I know, but it helps a ton to stay moisturized. My dermatologist said if I could help it I should always be slick with some sort of protective lotion. So now I carry little travel sized bottles of Aveno (with the blue cap). 

Try to avoid fragrances, dyes and harsh everything in your skincare. Treat your skin like the most sensitive little baby. I've switched to showering with Dr Bronner's and my dermatologist recommended I only clean the essentials. Avoid scrubbing your skin with something like a loofa or sponge. At most, a gentle washcloth, and even then you should avoid stripping your skin of too many oils. This is what works for me, but I have extremely sensitive and dry skin (Been battling some eczema too. Thanks winter!) so it might not work for you. 

I know that you don't want the area to scar, however, with morphea it is pretty much inevitable. Your skin scars because your immune system is attacking it from the inside out. What's left of those injuries healing is the scarring we see on the outside. However, only the deepest wounds scar, which is why a lot of people with morphea/scleroderma and other skin disorders like this tend to lose mobility and elasticity over time. 

The best and cheapest medication for treating morphea is Methotrexate. It will not cure the scarring you already have, but it usually helps the disorder go into remission and prevent more from popping up. It also helps with any joint pain and other symptoms you may have. Definitely ask about that. My skin has been worsening pretty viciously, but Methotrexate works wonders for a lot of people! It's an old medication and available generically. I wish you luck. I know this shit isn't easy.",1

167,2019-11-18 10:12:23+00:00,"Ho boi, you really are clueless. Even if the rankings are right - which they aren't - the reasoning is completely off.

ABOM: His stress heals are basically a non-factor and vastly overrated. 10 self heal at max rank + 2 team heal once per battle is borderline pointless, not to mention his beast form stress damage to the team negates most of that. It's pretty much there for aesthetics alone. As a damage dealer his role is essentially a more reliable and flexible but less bursty leper. Still great, but not nearly as good as you claim

FLAG: Max base damage first turn is 17 with Punish. Push that to 29 per turn given 3 full stacks of bleed, and again to 31 on 40% health, and again to 33 when afflicted. Deathdoor buffs aren't sustainable. Note he can only reach these numbers after focusing on a single target for 3 full turns and lands bleed every single time. Sounds great until you realize leper can do 26 per turn with no set up, and 32 with a single turn of set up per battle. For further comparison, bounty hunter does 16 on Collect Bounty without setup, 30 with 1 turn set up per target, 39 if target is human. Arbalest does 28 damage with a single turn of setup, plus a massive 21% crit chance. In terms of raw damage, Flag's damage isn't amazing, rather middle of the road, actually. He's strong in that Reclaim is the best single target heal, and having that with his reasonable damage makes him extremely versatile.

HWM: Riposte machine, nothing more. Point-blank Shot is actually rather niche, since piority targets are almost never in first position, and any abilities he has aside from it have mediocre numbers.

PD: First of all, that's a woman. Again, mediocre damage for the same reason as flag. Her kit highlights the real role of DoT in this game, which you clearly have no grasp of. DoT's job is to deny enemy turns, the amount of damage is secondary. Ignoring her Cure and corpse clear is also quite questionable. 

HEL: Credibility kind of goes down when you start calling everything ""veri veri gud"". Hellion has great burst but loses her edge in champion levels, where fights are considerably longer. The self-debuff attached to all of her more powerful skill means she becomes subpar if she can't finish the fight in the first 2-3 turns. 

Leper: Immobile, champion weald will make him cry and it restricts team composition. His lack of speed and low ACC also makes him a poor choice against a good number of enemies. If you're gonna start throwing tier lists about at least demonstrate you can see more weaknesses than one.

SB: Aegis. AEGIS. 4 Turns of raw damage immunity and a +4 SPD buff will mitigate more damage than any healing ever could. She also has one of the very few guard breaks in the game. Impale is a potential 4-man blight and if used right can deny several enemy turns with a single turn.

OCC: No one should ever be your only healer. Off healers are always needed if you don't wanna lose heroes. Shit's basic knowledge at this point. His main role is a debuffer, not healer, and to ignore the rest of his kit for heals just shows how little you understand the mechanics of the game. Prot stripping, mark, damage debuff and dodge stripping are far more important to the team than his heal.

BH: If you cant use a BH right that's your own fault. Top-tier attacker if given set-up support, shouldn't be marking enemies himself unless he just happen to need the hook. Main weakness for him is he diminishes in value if he's the only mark-based damage dealer in the team.

Jester: Christ. You serious? Battle Ballad, +10 ACC, +6% crit, +4 speed, 4 turns and stackable. 3 of the most important stats packed into one turn, yet all you can think of is stress heal and not having the most overrated mechanic in the game for you to use as a crutch.

Vestal: Healbot vestal is literally the biggest noobtrap in the game, so I applaud your confidence in thinking your list has any credibility what-so-ever. Put simply, the only hp that matters is your last point. Turn-to-turn, the only heal abilities that could out-heal champion level damage dealers are Wyrd Reconstruction, Redeem and  Exsanguinate, all of which are unreliable. A turn wasted using divine grace on someone not at death's door is another turn a damage dealer enemy lives, and you'll almost always get a net loss of health. At champion difficulty Divine Grace can basically be ignored, as Divine comfort can cover multiple death's doors in the team with just 1 turn. This is also why Reclaim is the best single target heal. With Profane Scroll, she can be a very potent frontline damage dealer, and her -30 dodge debuff is nothing to scoff at either.

Crusader: look mate if you're not gonna put any effort in this one me neither. 

Antiq: What's with you and overlooking all the actual core skills of each class? INVIGORATING FUCKING VAPOURS, +10 DODGE FOR THE WHOLE TEAM , 30 AFTER 3 TURNS. Again better than your precious healing at mitigating damage. And hear this, free fucking gold that's literally vital on harder difficulties due to day limits.

GR: You wut mate? Pickaxe is literally her most underwhelming skill. It's SB's pierce with 5% less damage, made worse by GR's lower base damage (max 14 vs max 18). Sure it's armour piercing but its base damage barely reaches double digits at max level. You'd get the same results if you just wacked an armoured enemy with a crusader or leper. Meanwhile, you go on to ignore Shadow Fade, which gives you double damage, +8% crit and is the only stealth on the player side. Combined with her already high base crit and dodge she can straight up delete enemies without taking a scratch.

ARB: For some reason? That reason is you're using them wrong. 28 damage + 32% crit chance with only a single turn setup that hits everything besides first position isn't anywhere remotely near ""really low damage"". Stun and Mark clear turns wealds and Swine God into a right joke. Most heals are only good for deaths doors, but bandage is actually not, that's entirely inaccurate 4-5 + 38% stackable increase is actually one of the few chances you get to heal someone back to full within reasonable amount of turns. 

HM: Uses a character completely wrong, ignores one of the core mechanics and teambuilding entirely. Claims the class is bad. K.

MaA: It takes a special kind of stupid to not notice a dedicated tank in a game. Why would you use the character with support tank written all over his design as a damage dealer? Thank god you aren't in the army, you'd wound up grabbing your rifle by the barrel and trying to wack enemies to death with the stock. MaA has the best guard, can cap out PROT with trinkets and skills, a battle-long dodge and stress buff, and a stackable ACC and crit buff. 

Basically, try again, or more preferably, don't. Dunning and Kruger can be a bitch at times.",1

 Nos jogos de plataforma tradicionais, os personagens devem caminhar para o lado direito da tela para passar de fase. Mas em “Mosaic”, jogo norueguês que será lançado em 5 de dezembro no Steam, se o jogador decidir ir para a esquerda, pode encontrar agradáveis surpresas.

  Sobre o caráter metafórico disso “você é livre para interpretar como quiser”, diz via Skype o diretor-executivo do estúdio Krillbite, Jon Cato Lorentzen, que segura o riso em seu escritório em Oslo. 

 O jogo segue o dia a dia de um trabalhador de uma mega corporação, que vive em uma espécie de distopia atual, na qual praticamente não há contato físico, relações interpessoais e nem muito motivo para ser otimista. Com uma paleta de cores escuras, é tudo monótono, repetitivo e sem sentido. O protagonista segue apenas vivendo, até que se rebela contra o sistema.

 O diretor criativo do estúdio, Adrian Tingstad Husby, explica o título. “A empresa para a qual você trabalha dentro do jogo se chama ‘Mosaic’. Além disso, o game é sobre como várias pequenas peças formam uma grande estrutura”, diz. “É uma história sobre alguém excluído do sistema, mas também sobre alguém que se liberta disso.”

 A ideia surgiu durante o exaustivo processo final de desenvolvimento do jogo anterior do estúdio, [“Among the Sleep”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/vice/2015/06/1641233-a-ascensao-da-industria-de-games-da-noruega.shtml) (disponível para PS4, Xbox e no Steam para Windows e Mac). “Estávamos trabalhando dia e noite para conseguir finalizar o jogo dentro do prazo”, diz Husby. “Fazer games é bem diferente de jogar games”, ri.

 Curioso um jogo descrente em relação ao futuro como “Mosaic” ter surgido na Escandinávia, terra do Estado de bem-estar social que costuma figurar entre os países mais felizes do mundo no World Happiness Report —em 2019, Noruega e Dinamarca ficaram em segundo e terceiro lugar, respectivamente.

 “Somos extremamente privilegiados na Noruega. Vivemos em uma sociedade que funciona, o Estado cuida [de seus cidadãos]”, diz Lorentzen. A produção de “Mosaic” recebeu cerca de US$ 500 mil (cerca de R$ 2,1 milhões) de recursos públicos do governo.

 “Mas nós nos sentimos conectados com o resto do mundo, estamos sempre sendo lembrados dos lados ruins do capitalismo. Quando fomos a San Francisco, nos Estados Unidos, vimos a pobreza”, conclui Lorentzen —e olha que eles não visitaram cidades da América Latina ou rincões da África ou da Ásia.

 A correlação de “Mosaic” com a série [“Mr. Robot”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucianacoelho/2016/08/1799404-mr-robot-prende-espectador-na-paranoia-do-heroi-em-nova-temporada.shtml) é quase automática. Ambos falam de ativismo e revolução na era digital, além de sistemas construídos para controlar as pessoas. Husby não nega que a comparação faz sentido, mas elenca referências menos atuais para sua obra.

 Ele cita os filmes [“Brazil”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/10/grupo-ingles-monty-python-faz-50-anos-e-mantem-a-relevancia-no-humor.shtml) (Terry Gilliam, 1985) e “Playtime - Tempo de Diversão” (Jacques Tati, 1967), Charles Chaplin e os escritores Aldous Huxley, George Orwell e H.G. Wells.

 Mas Husby afirma que sua principal inspiração foi o jogo “Every Day the Same Dream” (todo dia o mesmo sonho, em português), do italiano Paolo Pedercini. Definindo-se como um “marxista complicado”, evocando [Slavoj Zizek](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/04/provocador-e-ecletico-zizek-dobra-a-aposta-contra-o-capitalismo.shtml), Pedercini é professor no departamento de artes da universidade Carnegie Mellon, em Pittsburgh, nos EUA.

 O jogo, em duas dimensões, tecnologia Flash e gratuito, foi feito em menos de uma semana, em 2009. Com uma paleta de cores ainda mais limitada —alguns poucos tons de cinza—, ele segue a rotina sem graça de um zé ninguém que trabalha num cubículo.

 O jogador pode levar o protagonista a seguir a mesma rotina várias vezes. Mas também pode fazer com que ele vá ao trabalho só de cueca ou dê um passeio com uma vaca em vez de bater o ponto —ou ainda incitá-lo a se jogar de um prédio.

 Pedercini diz ter superado os tempos de “Every Day the Same Dream”. “Estou em outra agora. Tem gente que acha que é válido apostar no mesmo tipo de estética, narrativa. Para mim, já está ultrapassado. Existe uma infinidade de jogos sobre loops de tempo, sobre alienação do trabalhador.”

 Ele diz que a intenção inicial da obra era fazer uma paródia dos “games de arte”. “Eu estava tirando sarro desse clichê do homem assalariado que tem uma vida triste, mas que está mais na mente dos artistas do que na vida real”, diz Pedercini. Quando o designer adicionou uma trilha sonora à la Radiohead, porém, a criação ganhou uma aura mais dramática.

 A crítica ao sistema —seja ele qual for— é uma constante na carreira do italiano. Para financiar seu estúdio, ele já vendeu camisas com os dizeres “nós somos materialistas históricos dos videogames”, em referência ao conceito marxista.

 Mas ele é mais conhecido pelo aplicativo “Phone Story”, que mostra a cadeia de produção dos smartphones. Primeiro, o jogador controla soldados que coagem crianças escravizadas na região do Congo. Depois tenta evitar suicídios de funcionários chineses. Por fim, organiza a reciclagem de lixo gerado a partir de telefones celulares, que é feita em condições insalubres por pessoas pobres em países de terceiro mundo.

 O [game foi banido](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/tec/2011/09/979454-ja-previa-punicao-diz-autor-de-jogo-banido-pela-apple.shtml) menos de quatro horas depois de ter subido na loja virtual da Apple.

 Visualmente, o jogo é bem simples, com gráficos tão rudimentares quanto os de um “Pokémon Blue”. “O objetivo não era que o jogo fosse interessante por si só. Era mais o gesto de criar um game como esse e colocá-lo na App Store.”

 “Eu sou um designer de games”, diz o italiano, dando ênfase à palavra “designer”. “Respeito o ofício do designer, então é um pouco decepcionante que este seja o meu jogo mais conhecido [risos].”

 Pedercini comanda a Molleindustria, estúdio que tem entre seus objetivos a “reapropriação dos videogames”.

 “Eu prefiro criar uma distância crítica, em que os jogadores não ficam somente imersos em algo, mas sim pensando ativamente no que estão fazendo ou no que significa aquilo que estão jogando.” Seus últimos jogos abordaram gentrificação e urbanismo, na contramão de franquias como “SimCity”.

 Mas tanto Pedercini quanto Lorentzen e Husby se mostram otimistas quanto ao futuro. O próximo projeto dos noruegueses da Krillbite, que já conseguiu financiamento, pretende ser um “jogo alegre, que se passa em um mundo colorido”, diz Husby.

 Já Pedercini está trabalhando em uma aventura passada em futuro próximo, uma utopia que seguiu o que ele diz julgar ser o caminho certo.

I had 2 responses of 2 people. 1 was a truck driver and 1 was a guy that worked in a distribution center. The truck driver said all the routes, people that handle the cargo + even in some places there is a sort of real security that hangs behind the truck full of expensive pharm's. They look at it like transporting gold or cold hard cash in some places. Also the guy that made the shipments ready that a whole day had to load pallets with all the pharma's like oxycodone , fentanyl, morfine,etc etc also many different benzo's all sort of rx medications. It's almost the same background checks, security etc like working in a vault of a bank. They checked your background very very VERY well even in coming and leaving work it's all differents security checks you have to go through every day. Even so secure that every door you had to open only opened with your badge from the company, so they can track every min who is were and of course the place is full of camera's. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then again I KNOW MYSELF of a woman here in Belgium that had worked by Janssen pharma (the company were my durogesic patches are from and were the founder of fentany dr Paul Janssen was the creaotr off) that there is MANY ""product"" with just a bad printing but still good product goes to the waste pile.

One problem with this of course is that it would be taking money out of a domestic economy, and putting it into one abroad. But, that's why the people should be allowed to earn income whilst they are abroad. 

It would also be a way for nations to compete in the field of diplomacy and the gaining of international networks. 

There would be many risks to consider, cultural conflicts, background checks, insurance. But there is plenty of potential for gain too.

If i had to guess, foundlings can be war orphans, bounty orphans, unlucky souls found in the field that would have died otherwise. Mandalorians dont make a distinction between a Mando born into the culture and one that was brought in as an orphin or even a person who found their way to the lifestyle  later in life but decides to live by the codes. There are however recognized levels of status within the culture. Not every mandalorian born has what it takes to become recognized as a warrior of the clan. Not everyone gets a chance at heirloom armor. Not everyone is cut out but they do have many specialties they can fall into. The Mando in the show is def Mando already. His Mandoness is locked in, what hes working toward is being recognized as a legit warrior, hunter, protector status and getting a signet is a sign of the clan or clans sogning off on hit skill and merit and the achievement of acquiring a full beskar’gam (complete mando armor) at a time when beskar is super hard to come by. So this will make his achievements more impressive to the clan/clans. And they wont care that he was a foundling. Just like mandos dont care about gender or sexuality.

I made an account just to comment this. I don't know if this will help, but when I had an abortion I was on subs, 2mg every night, 11pm. abortion was 4pm, and they gave me fent via IV for sedation (75 something?). Never done fent or heroin in my life. Only oxycotin. I was fine. My doctor told me it's a myth that ""you can't take opiate medication while on subs"". As long as Suboxone is in your system already, you'll be okay. Perhaps Google it from there to see if you find anything else, but that's my experience. I would also do like, 160mg oxys while on subs and I'd be perfectly fine to take subs the same night or next night.

The FDA has approved a record number of generic medicines every year since he has been in office breaking the monopoly that big pharma companies have had on the market, allowong for cheaper prices, more competition, and an increased likelihood of companys like the makers of oxycotin not being able to exploit the American public for profit, subsequently causing another crisis like the opiod epidemic that oxycotin caused, and I could literally go on and on",1

I chase the clock if I take Subutex, constantly feeling pain and chills, usually needing a higher dose than prescribed to function. But if I take Suboxone, then 12mg is fine. There's no reason for it, but that's my experience. They say 72 hours, but I've run out before on a Monday, taken my last 8mg tablet and be so, so sick come noon on Wednesday that I'm shaking, covered in sweat, and my blood pressure is through the roof.  My doctor told me that if I lost 5-8 pounds, that I'd be more comfortable and maintained on my dose. I also know when I was using, I never made it 6 hours without being awaken from sleep to use. I tried heroin, oxy, morphine, mscontin. If normal people would get 12 hours, I'd only get 6 hours. I wake up and immediately reach for my bottle because I've already trashed the bed from rolling around in pain and soaked through the sheets in sweat. The science says my body shouldnt be behaving this way, but that's just my reality. It sucks. No one believes me or tells me its all mental even though I have no desire to get high, have accepted that I can not use successfully, and put a lot of energy into my recovery. Its not just opioids either. As a child, my dentist would have to make a note a remind herself that novacain and gas at the normal kid doses wouldn't work on me. She'd end up sticking me 5 or 6 times with kids amounts before she started just remembering to use way larger doses. When I was using, my boyfriend introduced me to meth, and gave me the same dose he was taking as a 20 year user and that he expected to knock me through a wall, but it didn't do hardly anything and I had to redose a couple times just to even notice it enough to tell him what I thought about it, all the while he's staring at me like I'm some alien or zombie, positive that I was going to overdose myself. I think there has to be some sort of gene that makes you more tolerant to drugs than most other people. I was told that my mother was the exact same way, she passed away at the age of 31 about 10 years ago before I even started using so I can't ask her myself, but apparently she'd get sick only a few hours after dosing even on methadone and for that reason would always relapse.

I hope you get some answers too.  The mirena coil is the one they offer most people, my friend is 50 and hasn't had a period in 10 years (changed at 5).  I had it and bled for 4 months solid, I was told it needed 6 months to properly see what is going on but after my 4th blood transfusion the doctor at rhe hospital took it out and wrote a scathing letter to my GP.  The only thing that ever helped was rhe pill but then as I got older it stopped being so effective.  My gynae told me it was because I was fat so when I had my gastric by pass, had the ectopic and had to go back and see him and I asked him bluntly why, when I was 18 stone he treated me so atrociously and refused to help me till I lost weight but at 10 stone he was willing to help me when my symptoms were the same.  It was all documented and I put a formal complaint in against him as it was well known he blamed all women's problems on their weight 🙄 despite what size you were.  A dreadful man, when I was having my son he came in and I screamed at him to get the fuck out or we were not having my son today and then I dlatlined (my son was lying on the vena cava) but his registrar was there and the anaesthetist who was just amazing said calmly 'get the baby out stat'.  I saw myself flatljne and shut my eyes to go to sleep.  The second he was out and the cord cut I was given atropine which kick started my heart and I heard a seagull squaring in the corner which was my son - they'd given me diamorphone before so I was as high as a kite.  There was blood everywhere so another 3litres  of blood but I was up walking about that night with my drips and a baby.  The woman in the bed opposite had an electric bed and had her son 3 days before me and still hadn't got up and called for a nurse to be given her baby etc.  She said to me 'it was so bad I had to have a caeserean' I told her so did I, that I also died, I didn't have an electric bed and look, I was walking round and to stop making the nurses get your baby, you deal with him, it's been 3 days and they'll kick you out tomorrow.  Yeah I'm mean but these nurses were so overworked. The next morning they bought breakfast in and she told them what she wanted and they made her get up, I went to get up and they deliberately gave me my toast in bed due to my extremely Traumatic experience which was one of the worst they'd seen to basically get this woman to realise she wasn't the only one.  They told her they were discharging her and she had a meltdown.  We ended up at the same nursery and it was her daughter who used to regularly bite kids as her mum never said no to her, she bit my son on his face and drew blood and I told the mother I was calling the police as regardless of age it is assault and she needs to reign her daughter in and teach her the word no.  She is at a local girls school near the school my son goes to and she's still the same, lashes out when she doesn't get her own way then plays victim.  Apple never fell far from the tree.  I hope for her sake she changes but at 14 she hopefully has time.  The mother sees me as the schools have mixed functions and she still plays victim, her mum practically bought her daughter up as she struggled, she struggled with everything so it must have been hard on her but thank god she never had anymore!

I have CP now, finally trying to accept it.
just found this spot and still full off questions. 
On creon and that helped a bit,
oxycodon, paracetamol oxazepam and cannabis. 

Still hurts so much that I've stopped eating bit by bit.
Bottled food now , trying lactofree yoghurt to start up again. 

Really need to get off the morphine but how?
I saw it on Vice about kratom against pain, that could take over the oxycodon am I right ?
And tramadol is enough ? That would be great. 

Yep 4 is the new zero I guess, when I'm lucky. 

That moving on part , love to read it ,now it feels like the pills are killing me. Going nowhere. 
Can you please give more info on how you achieve that. For me it feels like I'm stuck now and that's a scarry place. 
Reading this gives me hope again ! Thanks !!!

Also did try kratom, but was afraid to double it up on the oxycodon. 
Can you give more info on how you dose it and process it ?
I saw a few clips on YouTube , still not sure about the right brew. 

Also for the turmeric how do u use it ?, kurkuma here, i really need to get off this morphine stuff, it stops my digestion and gives more pain then it takes it feels for me. 
I was told that ibuprofen was a bad idea, it's not ?

That astronaut stuf is new to me, the phenibut
Tell me more  ;)
Reads like it's amazing stuff, just don't do it every day ?

Hope you are moving on just fine !",1

I smoke cannabis, and use CBD/THC oil.

It helps me in those 35 minutes where the oxycodon has to kick in. But that's when I smoke it.

276,2019-11-09 10:10:42+00:00,"Ok tek sad sam shvatio da ne pise na slici, ali nitko nece vuce ""lajne"" heroina u klubu (naravno uvijek postoje iznimke). Znaci pricamo o **kokainu** (moguce i da je speed/neki amfetamin).

Heroin je druga klasa droge (opioid) dok su kokain i amfetamini stimulanti.

Kad smo vec kod trenutne opioidne krize u SAD-u, ona je vecinom postala popularna dolaskom fentanyla na crno trziste (fentanyl=**100 puta** jaci od morfina) i njegovih analoga npr. carfentanil (**10000 jaci** od morfina). Doza fentanyla se mjeri u **micro**gramima, pa mislim da mozes razumjeti zasto je postao tako popularan i zasto se jako lagano predozirati s njim.

Dileri (jer crno trziste naravno nije regulirano) mijesaju fentanyl/carfentanil s heroinom i drugim opioidima kako bi prodali ""jaci"" opioid. S obzirom na to da je dozirati njih tesko i nepredvidljivo (smjese nisu homogene, znaci ako si pomjesas ne mora znacit da ces uvijek dobiti 90% heroina i 10% fentanyla) predoziranja, a onda i smrti su ucestale.

E sad da je heroin dostupan (najbolje legalan), ne bi bilo toliko potrebe za fentanylom i analozima i bilo bi puno manje stradalih. Za one koji su upali u ralje narkomanije i ovisnosti bi jos uvijek postojala sansa da se vrate, no nazalost za one koji su se predozirali zbog nastale situacije vise nema povratka.

Necu ulaziti dublje kako su se ljudi u americi uopce navukli na takve droge ali: 

*What the U.S. Surgeon General dubbed ""The Opioid Crisis"" likely began with over-prescription of opioids in the 1990s, which led to them becoming the most prescribed class of medications in the United States. Opioids initiated for post surgery or pain management are one of the leading causes of opioid misuse, where approximately 6% of people continued opioid use after trauma or surgery.*

*Between 1991 and 2011, painkiller prescriptions in the U.S. tripled from 76 million to 219 million per year, and as of 2016 more than 289 million prescriptions were written for opioid drugs per year.*

Zanimljivo je kako ljudima stav o drogi jako negativan, ali ako ti slucajno to doktor prepise odmah se stav promjeni i mislis da mozes uzimati koliko hoces. Ja smatram da je glavni razlog za takvo ponasanje manjak edukacije sto proizlazi iz toga jer su droge stigmatizirane.

296,2019-11-07 18:31:47+00:00,"I have Pectus Excavatum too! It was around 1 inch too deep and I did need a surgery for it to be corrected.I only found out about around 2 years ago, maybe less. I'll break things down into 3 parts: Before surgery, during, after (at the hospital and a little bit at home), and if it was worth it-

Before surgury -
First of all I, i f I hear what I define as bad news, I feel immediately sick, so when I had a doctor tell me and my parents I needed a surgery, I got a huge hot flash and just about threw up right in the little appointment room or whatever you call it. My parents and doctor gave me a choice to have this surgery, which I was surprised since it's a big life decision and I was a teen (still am) so I didn't think I'd have a say. 
I was really, REALLY scared for this, not fond of the thought of having my chest opened up. Also I've never had been to a hospital or had any major medical thing happen in my life since my birth. Even an hour before surgery I was worried... I was piss my pants scared.

During surgery-
Well I remember the doctors laying me in a bed telling me to undress and all of that. It made me uncomfortable since I was in front of my parents, but after that the stuck me with an IV. Not soon later, they were wheeling me into the operating room. I felt like I was M.Shadows from A7X in their ""Nightmare"" music video, so that was dope. Then when we arrived at the room, I remember having a conversation with a surgeon, i forgot what about. Before I knew it o woke up in my little hospital room. It took less than 2 hours! 

After surgery-
So I remember being suprized at the little amount of pain I woke up with. (I was on oxycotin or however you spell it) I remember looking at my stitches as thinking ""this is pretty f***ing metal, heck yeah"". But then I go lower and.... There is a little TUBE IN MY UREATHRA!!!! I didn't even know how the hell they put anything down that thingy! This tube was at least like half a centimeter in diameter, so pretty big for a teenage pp hole. The nurses and surgeon checked up on my every few hours or so, they were more than nice (I rate 6/5 stars). I did feel really bad for them though, collecting bags of my urine that was hooked up to the tube. I apologized everytime to whoever came in to clean it out. Oh god, did that hurt when they had to remove that rubber tube. They just pulled out my delicate weenee. Anyway, i think on my 2nd day in the hospital an occupational therapist came in to help me move my limbs without being in immense pain, and on the 3rd she was helping me practice walking up stairs. On the 4th day I was ready to go home, but they said I need to poop once before I left. "" no big deal"" I thought. Boy was I wrong. The constipation was so bad, I'd almost would rather have another tube pulled out my Wang. I finally was able to dump on the 5th day, I went home and that was that.
I think one of the worst parts after Pectus Excavatum is sleeping. You're not allowed to sleep on oh chest for I think 4 weeks after surgery, and I normally sleep on my stomach with my head to my side. When they sent me home, they send me with A TON of painkillers. I didn't even use half by the time I decided I didn't want to take them anymore. I'm glad, I had a speedy recovery and not alot of pain at all (which is why I stopped taking the painkillers).
Now, about 5 months after the surgery, I still experience some pain, but not alot. Every few times a day I feel that my left sides hurt decently if I turn my torso a certain way, but other than that I'm cool

Was it worth it?-
Uhhh, HELL YES! First of all, now I'm not as nervous or timid about surgery's and other medical procedures. Also exercising is SO much Easier. (For people with Pectus Excavatum, it is hard to exercise because the cave in of you chest pushes against the heart and lungs). The thing is that for me, this costed my parents 60,000 DOLLARS!!! but my parents had good insurance so it's cool. (Just adding this fact in because it is NOT cheap). These are just a few things, but I'm in class now so I can't type much more lmao.

The Pauline epistles themselves are not in chronological order, rather in order of length, so this would not be surprising. Other suggestions have been the soldier living away from his family.

In Acts 21:38, we hear of a Roman soldier asking Paul if he was that Egyptian, not the Acts declaring Paul to be that man. I don't see a problem here, the Roman soldier may have been mistaken. A quote from Barnes' Notes on the Bible suggests that according to Josephus, the Jewish leader hailed from the Jewish community in Egypt. I have not read Josephus myself to verify the references in the commentary, but here it is for your benefit:

&gt; Art not thou that Egyptian? - That Egyptian was probably a Jew who  resided in Egypt. Josephus has given an account of this Egyptian which  strikingly accords with the statement here recorded by Luke. See  Josephus, Antiq., book 20, chapter 8, section 6, and Jewish Wars, book  2, chapter 13, section 5. The account which he gives is, that this  Egyptian, whose name he does not mention, came from Egypt to Jerusalem,  and said that he was a prophet, and advised the multitude of the common  people to go with him to the Mount of Olives. He said further that he  would show them from thence how the walls of Jerusalem would fall down:  and he promised them that he would procure for them an entrance through  those walls when they were fallen down. Josephus adds (Jewish Wars) that  he got together 30,000 men that were deluded by him; ""these he led  round about from the wilderness to the mount which was called the Mount  of Olives, and was ready to break into Jerusalem by force from that  place. But Felix, who was apprised of his movements, marched against him  with the Roman soldiers, and defeated him, and killed 400 of them, and  took 200 alive. But the Egyptian escaped himself out of the fight, but  did not appear anymore."" It was natural that the Roman tribune should  suppose that Paul was this Egyptian, and that his return had produced  this commotion and excitement among the people. 

Finally, any issue between Paul's representations in his early ministry and his writings at the tail end of his ministry should not be concerning. Paul extols us to be all things to all people (1 Corinthians 9:19-23). If his language and persuasion are different, that is to be expected from Paul. If he actually contradicts a teaching (e.g. says that circumcision is good in one breath and bad in another) that would be more concerning.",1

Eu não gosto da solução dada por GRRM. Acho que não combina com o resultado que aconteceu com Braavos. Se ele tivesse furado o bloqueio apenas porque achava que faria muito dinheiro, o fato de Stannis lhe ter dado terras e títulos deveria ser encarado também segundo o mesmo materialismo (até porque Stannis teria matado qualquer sentimentalismo do presente ao reinvidicar os dedos da mão esquerda de Davos).

Um amigo pediu que eu notasse que ganhar terras e títulos seria o equivalente a ganhar na mega-sena em Westeros. Porém, para mim isso só reforça a recompensa material.

Na verdade (e sabendo que o que vou dizer não é menos do que heresia e alta traição), eu prefiro [a justificativa que criaram para Davos nos extras do DVDs da 2ª temporada de Game of Thrones](https://youtu.be/p8k0ffR098Y?t=126). Ou seja, que Davos usou essa história que lucraria ao vender peixes e cebolas para que não suspeitassem dele, pois na verdade ele começou a nutrir uma admiração pelo homem que estava guardando Ponta Tempestade há quase 1 ano, contra todas as apostas.

Segundo os extras, Davos foi a Ponta Tempestade se sentindo meio tolo por estar fazendo aquilo por um homem que não conhecia. Esse é um tipo de pensamento com o qual eu acho qualquer um pode se identificar, além de parecer mais verossímil que um contrabandista ache que seu heroísmo era sua fraqueza.

Daí, quando Stannis gratificasse Davos com um título de cavaleiro e terras da sua escolha no Cabo da Fúria, nada menos do que pura admiração é o que eu esperaria de Davos. Seria como uma espécie de admiração mútua (ou amor corrrespondido) e aí toda essa vassalagem furiosamente leal de Davos estaria justificada, bem como sua total redenção de seu passado como criminoso.

Daí, quando Stannis ainda assim exige-se os dedos da mão esquerda, Davos enxergaria quão profunda é a noção de justiça de Stannis e seria verossímil que ele desse a mão feliz e requisitasse que Stannis manejasse ele próprio a faca. Desse modo, a perda dos dedos seria um rito de passagem que selaria o destino de Davos ao de Stannis.

Vassalagem amorosa e trovadorismo em sua melhor forma.

&gt;**Em quê o baixo nascimento de Davos influencia seu caráter?**

Dá a Davos um visão realista do mundo. Acredito que dificilmente veríamos noções como ""só um homem esfomeado suplica pão a um pedinte"" para definir que, se a Patrulha da Noite estava suplicando ajudar militar até a um reivindicante ao trono derrotado como Stannis, era porque a condição dela era absolutamente desesperadora.

Olhando para o poder com o prisma de Maquiavel, o baixo nascimento fazia de Davos o conselheiro perfeito para uma pessoa tão impopular quanto Stannis, pois segundo o pai da ciência política moderna ""*para bem conhecer a natureza dos povos, é preciso ser príncipe, e, para conhecer bem a dos príncipes, é necessário pertencer ao povo""* (MAQUIAVEL, Nicolau. O Príncipe. Carta de Nicolau Maquiavel ao Magnífico Lourenço de Médici\*).\*

Outro reflexo ocorre na escolha do brasão e do nome Seaworth. Ele poderia ter escolhido algo pomposo e presunçoso que indicasse ambição política. Mas ele prefere algo que não apagar seu passado, mas ressaltá-lo. Talvez isso lhe dê a impressão de que ele é um heroi de guerra.

Sem falar que o brasão segue a mesma lógica daquele dos Clegane.

&gt;**Por que Davos é tão honesto?**

Eu acho difícil justificar essa honestidade com base na justificativa que Martin dá para Davos ter entrado em Ponta Tempestade. Se ele tivesse feito tudo pelo dinheiro, Davos deveria ser um homem muito esperto e com um olho muito bom para os negócios.

Seria até mais divertido se Davos fosse um larápio que apenas se comportava como o perfeito servo na frente de Stannis. Essa obediência decorreria de conhecer que Stannis teria uma baixa tolerância a bajulação e Davos saber que os cargos de seus filhos e a proteção de suas terras dependiam de sua proximidade com Stannis (pois seu suserano, Renly, poderia não ter nenhuma deferência com ele).

Contudo, a justificativa dos extras do DVD não parecem necessitar de muitas alterações ou de ginástica mental. Davos havia deixado seu passado para trás e ter descoberto um senhor em cujo senso de justiça poderia confiar. Alternativamente, seria possível mostrar nos livros mais recentes que Davos não gostava da vida de contrabandista, apenas que fazia porque lhe rendia dinheiro e reputação.

&gt;**Em quê ter sido um contrabandista influencia no caráter de Davos?**

Torna Davos mais flexível do que Stannis (o que o ajuda a ter mais sensibilidade e intuição) e possuidor de um feixe de habilidades que são úteis para ganhar um guerra sem ataques massivos contra o inimigo (vide tomada de Ponta Tempestade).

Fora isso, sua carreira como contrabandista o deve ter feito ousado acima do recomendável.

&gt;**Por que um contrabandista como Davos acredita na justiça?**

Há um precedente que deve ser lembrado antes de qualquer especulação: a execução do capitão do navio que Davos servia quando jovem pela Patrulha da Noite. Davos descreve que não deixou de fazer negócio com a Patrulha por conta disso, ""mas apesar de ter aceitado o seu dinheiro, nunca esqueceu o modo como a cabeça do Bastardo Cego tinha rolado pelo convés do *Gato da Calçada*"" (ASOS, Davos V).

Aqui também a coisa difere caso se acredite na versão de Martin ou na versão dos extras do DVD.

Caso Davos tivesse ido a Ponta Tempestade em razão de dinheiro (como disse GRRM), ele não deveria ter nenhuma crença em justiça, objetivamente falando e esse seu alinhamento à visão de justiça de Stannis seria uma hipocrisia com seu passado.

Com efeito, a Patrulha da Noite havia executado Roro Uhoris em razão dele ter comerciado armas com os selvagens, inimigos da Patrulha e, teoricamente, dos Sete Reinos. Portanto, a razão soa como justa. Ainda assim, Davos tinha reservas quanto a ela.

Por outro lado, caso Davos tivesse ido a Ponta Tempestade por admiração e compaixão, Davos deveria acreditar em algum tipo de justiça, ainda que este sentimento adormecesse diante dos lucros do contrabando. Assim, quando foi apresentado a um homem tão rígido no sentido de justiça quanto Stannis, esse sentimento pode ter despertado e se fortalecido dentro dele.

&gt;**Por que Davos ama tanto Stannis?**

Essa vassalagem semi-amorosa é muito estranha para alguém que entrou em Ponta Tempestade procurando um cliente, ganhou na mega-sena e perdeu a ponta dos dedos. Na corte de Stannis, vemos Davos agir com independência no gestos, mas não no coração. Supeito que, se nosso POV na corte de Stannis fosse outra pessoa, acredito que haveria gente que suspeitaria que essa fidelidade ardente poderia não ser autêntica.

De certa forma, é como se acreditássemos que Nestor Royce passasse a amar Petyr Baelish acima de tudo porque ele lhe garantiu os Portões da Lua. Estou ciente que as situações são muito diferentes a ponto de ser legítimo que alguém me acuse de estar comparando laranjas com maçãs. Contudo, caso você se concentre no quadro geral dos dois eventos, talvez o caso de Nestor lhe ajude a enxergar as fissuras na caracterização de Davos.

&gt;**Há algum personagem na história do mundo real ou da ficção que você acha parecido com Braavos? (pode ser até mesmo algum outro personagem do universo de Martin)**

Hoje, a maioria do fandom aponta para Alyn Punho de Carvalho pela trajetória: nascido bastardo, viraram Lordes, excelentes marinheiros, mutilados, quase morrem queimados, missão secreta para resgatar herdeiros.

Mas antes de a história de Alyn ser conhecida, era um forte consenso que Ned e Davos davam a sensação de serem personagens parecidos, mas um sendo a versão aristocrática e o outro a versão plebeia. Como se Davos fosse tão leal quanto Ned, mas mais vivido, mais difícil de ser pego pelas costas.

A questão de Davos estar fora de casa há tanto tempo, de guerra em guerra e perdendo filhos enquanto a mulher dele espera em casa por seu retorno já lhe rendeu também muitas comparações com Odisseu de Ítaca, personagem da Ilíada e da Odisséia.",1

Also most opioid overdoses in this era are caused by fentantyl contamination. Fentantyl is only a thing because, in our capitalist society, the cheapness of fentanyl incentivises using it as a cutting agent. Much more bang for your buck.

 This is why pressed bars of any depressant, even xanax, are dangerous. It's similar to how stimulants cna be contaminated by cathinones and mdma can contain the toxic pma.

So the problem isn't opioids themselves, but rather the criminalised, unregulated nature of these drugs which causes them to be much more dangerous.

Yes, it's easy to overdose even on pure products, especially if one misjudges one's tolerance, but this isn't exclusive to opioids. Usually people combine with alcohol. Benzo overdose can happen this way. It can happen with alcohol alone, which itself is much more toxic than the typical opioid. 

Some people including myself feel they must take certain drugs lest they suffer terribly (call that cowardly all you want but this is a real problem for many people and it would be graceful for you to demonstrate some compassion).

Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of actual chronic pain sufferers like myself are living in a constant state of fear and anxiety because they're threatening to take away the only thing that actually helps us, and in some cases, keeps us alive day to day. It's hard to find opioids because they aren't the main issue. The main issue is the already illegal drugs causing overdoses, and a very small amount of doctors over prescribing pain meds to get money from the manufacturers of the pills. Almost everybody prescribed opioids legally aren't selling them, because they need them. That's why it's hard to find them. Go to any street corner though, and you'll find heroin guaranteed. There's too many greedy agendas controlling this war on opioids and it only seems to be making the problem worse.
